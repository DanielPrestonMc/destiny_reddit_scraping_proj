THIS IS ME ASKING FOR YOUR THOUGHTS NOT ME SAYING IT'S 100% WHAT I THINK IT IS

&amp;#x200B;

 just wanted to scream that first okie

&amp;#x200B;

Alright bois so I'm the dude a while back who made the super long post about my studying the Pyramid Ships and what I believe the truth about them was. As a result of the time spent observing the Pyramid architecture in particular I am really confident in saying that I know it inside out. 

&amp;#x200B;

When BL came out I was extremely disappointed with the lack of Pyramid involvement in the campaign, the fact that the actual Pyramid interior was a copy and paste of the end of the Moon Pyramid, and the fact that the majority of the Pyramid architecture was relegated to ""simulations."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, the new architecture did have new engravings in the Exo Challenge missions, and the cruxes SPECIFICALLY have completely new whisper voice lines/creepiness (I recorded them for myself but I can upload them if you are interested.)

&amp;#x200B;

Long. Story. Short.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing the week 2 Exo Challenge, and I noticed at the end there was a style of engraving that didn't match the typical style of the place at all. I saw a rectangle going down, with a smaller one connected above. This exact engraving can be found on pillars in at least the second and third Exo Challenge, with the second challenge having that engraving as the outline for the entrance to the main complex (the part where you run in the tunnel with the disappearing floor, the pads form that symbol.) 

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing a third line separating the larger rectangle into two parts, in my mind this engraving represented one thing. A double edged blade with a thin rectangular hilt. I have to make this clear, this is going to be purely up to how you see it. Friends wise 3 agree with me and 2 are undecided, so I'm not just expecting everyone to see what I see.

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought it was a sword, and immediately a connection was made between this ""sword"" and the Sword Logic. This made sense to me, as although I do not believe the Pyramids to be the actual Darkness, I do believe they are allied with it, and so follow some form of the Sword Logic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at this thing which I think is a sword, and I'm just thinking. What struck me at the time was the ""handle"" and the ""blade."" The handle/hilt is thin and rectangular. The blade is double edged, but one side is wider than the other, the hilt not being in the direct centre of the blade as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately I thought of the Winnower’s blade, because I remember it being somewhat blocky as well. I pull up a picture and the similarities are extremely striking. Two double edged blades with one edge wider than the other, a third ""edge"" coming in from the side. I drew some lines in the slide to show you what I mean. At this stage, it’s really up to you as to whether or not you see the resemblance. I will argue with anyone that this is a sword, but if you think that it isn’t any sword in particular well, that’s all good.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the first part of this, which was just showing you what I found. The next is what this could mean if I'm right.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright for this part, assume that this engraving is in fact, a sword, and more that, the Winnower’s sword. What would this mean? I’ll tell you what it would mean for the Pyramids, the Winnower, and the deeper lore.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Pyramids this changes absolutely nothing about my beliefs surrounding them. In regards to the sword, it doesn’t really matter. Like I said, I don’t believe the Pyramids are the Darkness. I am adamant that the statue of the veiled lady is the Gardener, and the Pyramids who perhaps used to worship her,  are now allied with the Winnower, not actually him. It is very clear from what those inside the Pyramids have said that they do believe in some form of the Sword Logic, so seeing a sword is really not that surprising. If the sword is the sword I think it is, then this is a symbol of the logic that the Pyramids follow, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Winnower this would actually be extremely significant. If this is actually a representation of the sword shown in the concept art, then that concept art is what the Winnower to some extent looks like. Yes, I get it, he’s the Formless One, but if the Gardener has a physical form, then at some stage he must have had one as well. If you want proof about what the Gardener looks like I explain it all in my OG post and the video here: [https://youtu.be/xS4M-CIZBWQ](https://youtu.be/xS4M-CIZBWQ)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally for the lore, this is the really conspiracy theorist stuff. We're bringing out the Nastareth bois!  I would like to state that I am very aware that there are some people who groaned upon seeing that word, and to those of you I am sorry. But this is simply what I’ve found.

&amp;#x200B;

Sylok, THE DEFILED. Oh yeah, our buddy Silly Sylok. Sylok was a Taken Knight in the Prison of Elders and was experimented on by the Awoken. The Taken are pretty much braindead, and the only real stimulation that got some brain activity was pain, so they pretty much tortured him. He absolutely loved the pain, and one of the lines he said was “Blessed is the Nastareth.” ([https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/sylok-the-defiled?highlight=Nastareth](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/sylok-the-defiled?highlight=Nastareth)) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that is the only time in the lore that this word has been used, and no one has any idea what it means. If you google it you’ll find nothing, BUT, while I was searching the word Nastareth, I was met with the word Nastara.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there’s the name Nastara which means wild rose, don’t get mixed up with that. I believe it’s from Hindi, or one of the Indian languages, but a Nastara is a lancet. The plural of the word is nastaras/nashtaras btw so sounds very similar. Anyway a Nastara is a lancet, and a lancet, is a broad, double edged blade often used for surgery. What does any of this have to do with the Winnower you might ask? Ok this is where the waffle begins. The Winnower is the destroyer of life, but theoretically not all life. Only the life that he believes deserves it. As a result of this he is the pruner of the garden, the dude who separates the wheat from the chaff. He reaches in, cuts out a chunk of life, but is careful to only take what is needed. Sounds like the guy could use a lancet if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So why mention the Nastareth? Because honestly, at this stage what could it mean? It’s a word that’s dead in the water, most people not knowing it exists, and those who do know it having forgotten about its place in the big scheme of things. I’ve found a possible inspiration for the word, and that inspiration is a blade that fits with how the Winnower sees his work. So my friends, why not give the sword of the sword logic a name? Why not say the Winnower wields the Nastareth?

&amp;#x200B;

That is the conclusion to this discovery. I said it before and I’ll say it again, this isn’t me announcing that this is the 100% Winnower’s sword. Truth be told, even if I'm right, it's not too big a deal in my eyes, although it would tear down the notion that the veiled lady is the Winnower.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friends I will let you decide what this is. Is this as one of my friends put it, a hole in the wall? Do you think it’s a sword? Do you think it’s the Winnower’s sword. If you think it is, what do you think this means? Let me know.

raidsecrets,Secret symbol near Future War Cult room or just texture?,"Hey guys. I was walking around in the tower being a little sleep derived and stopped next to the future war cult, because i remembered that there was a new lore piece with the FWC. I then stopped right at the entrance and turned around to see Saint-14. I then saw [this little symbol scatched](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ewofb3IW8AIC2z6?format=jpg&amp;name=large) into the door frame that i wasn't able to find elsewhere.

My thoughts:

- My first thought was that it resembled one of the Ada-1 forges, but the forges have the [""wings"" lower than i initially remembered](https://www.vgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/destiny-2-izanami-forge-guide-2.jpg)

- After thinking a little bit i thought about Savathûn and how her ""viral song"" is going around and that through those the cabal started carving runes and summoned Xivu Arath (correct me if i'm wrong please). The carving is similar to [that one rune on the crown of sorrows.](https://i.imgur.com/hAAnCPU.jpeg) We also know that the viral tune is now affecting more and more people around the tower.

- Maybe its just a texture glitch. Points against it being a coincidence: Bungie wants to hide clues as well as they can because data mining is in full effect after each update. Best way to hide it is to put it in textures that can be mirrored and still make sense (see Five Nights At Freddies). If it was a coincidence, why is it so obviously in eye sight (tho you can argument that things like these typically aren't seen because they are not right at player level).


So what do you guys think? Just a random texture glitch or something Bungie put in on purpose? 

Also sorry if this was found already. I googled ""symbols around future war cult"" and saw no posts on this.",1615932731,2021-03-16 18:12:11

raidsecrets,The Sparrow Wall Climb Method,"Hey guys,

I don't usually post my videos here anymore, but I thought this one might be particularly helpful.

I've found a way to use a Sparrow to climb most walls, and the best part is it can be done on any class...even Hunters.

---

What you'll need:

1.  Exotic Sparrow (roll capabilities)
2.  Any Class
3.  A wall. (preferably straight, but it can work on slanty ones too.)

---

How to do it:

1.  Stand next to a wall.
2.  Jump, spawn sparrow.
3.  Roll towards the wall until you're upside-down.
4.  Boost twice in the opposite direction from the wall.

This will cause your Sparrow to clip into the wall and hold it upside down for a short time.  Because of this, your Guardian will fall off the Sparrow and land back up on top of it.

This means that you will get your jumps back so you can repeat the process.

raidsecrets,Possible puzzle and findings about stars,"Hello.  
First I wanna make clear something: I don't intend to copy, be rude or disturb anybody. I am here to show my findings about a post from weeks ago. I am just a overthinker and might get things to far. If you don't intend to listen to what I have to say. Please, don't hate me for thinking something wrong. Thank you!

Ok, let's get started. So, some days ago, I found something about the limits in the prophecy dungeon's last part (the nine). It tends to go more towards the neon circle. (maybe you already known that)

Visual representation (sort of):[https://imgur.com/a/BmEwQki](https://imgur.com/a/BmEwQki)

If you look in the circle from behind it you can see the ""stars"" of the nine near her. Maybe it is meant to be like that, I mean, maybe we have to see something. I think we have to connect the dots/stars to form a constellation out of it which brings me up to the 2nd found.

The nine ""stars"": [https://imgur.com/a/O9o6AiL](https://imgur.com/a/O9o6AiL)

There are more constellations found in the Last Wish raid. Maybe you already seen my post about the stars we found in the Shuro Chi.

Post (if you didn't):

Kali also has 1 gazebo like that one:  [https://imgur.com/a/tcXRJEH](https://imgur.com/a/tcXRJEH)

The idea is. Bungie has some stars/constellation related ornaments/shells/projections/stuff. Maybe they added it just to remind us about those things.

Also, it seems a bit suspect.. why they added a different pattern for every single gazebo in the LW if there was nothing? Couldn't they copy past it.. also.. why are the stars so bright?

Another ""strange"" set of stars was found in the new cutscene that was leaked before. I also made a post about that, but I think there is nothing at all. Maybe just a reminder.

Maybe we can get the ""constellations"" aligned to the Last Wish symbols. Maybe we can found a code out of it. Maybe there is nothing at all.

raidsecrets,"Easy Queens Court, with Possible 11 Man!","Found a nice way into Queen's Court yesterday. No hour of ice climbing, or long infinite sparrow flying required :D

[https://youtu.be/YmBTQC50PkI](https://youtu.be/YmBTQC50PkI)

Just take the closer wrong warp, and sword fly to the left of the bubble. Then it's just like it was in the [Quantum Finisher days](https://youtu.be/WVPNaw5AlYI).

Since there's no sparrow needed, you can do this from the raid. See [here](https://youtu.be/2DHRrss9r9U?t=224) for how to get there.

This means for a few more days, it may be possible to do [with 11 people](https://youtu.be/mti73xFUnH0). One must be sacrificed to allow for the [wrong warp](https://youtu.be/pum2El-fO8o) to work. Since Dreaming City patrol from the raid is not matchmade, I believe it'll bypass the 9 player limit for most patrol zones.

If you're confident in your sword flying, perhaps head over to the [\#glitches](https://discord.gg/FHbydn67) channel on the Raid Secrets discord, and we'll see about organizing the 12 man before that part of the glitch is patched.

raidsecrets,Scanning 2 Secret Scannables Behind the Glykon,"Since the Glykon was added, u/Shadeslayer738 discovered some Scannables behind the Glykon in the SPACE Zone. They seemed to be out of reach but I have discovered that 2 clusters of them can be scanned.

If your behind the ship looking at the thrusters, the 1st is located on top of the Left Thruster.

The 2nd reachable via the opposite side. There is a metal frame thing going from the side of the ship to the roof. It requires the use of Thundercrash or perhaps blade barrage to push through the height barrier. Once up there, you will eventually be able to scan the scannable after a few attempts as you keep res’ing up there.

There is 2 more clusters of these scannables but they are definitely beyond reach.

Do they do anything?

Nope..

But it’s cool to be able to say you’ve scanned them :)

Maybe other weapons work too, it's just the lament deals a lot of dmg in one hit so in the chaos of the battle it was clearly visible, the wyvern's health decreasing.

*My original post*
&gt;Had something weird happen to me the other night, never had it occur before so wanted to share it here.

Normally, the boss encounter is split between killing the big boy with orange shields and the transcendent hydra that hides toward the player on the right or left of the map. You kill those two, boom, you're done.


I managed to kill the big boy in one phase (curaiss thundercrash + volotile induction) but had to do all 3 phases to kill the transcendent. 1st phase damage on transcendent is as normal he teleports away after taking damage and ads spawn in. Cleared ads and the transcendent rememerges, but this time with another orange shielded hydra, a model I've never seen, shorter and stumpier than the original big boy hydra, but still larger than the transcendent. On the third phase, we killed the stumpy orange hydra and no shit, 9/10 wyverns spawned simultaneously. I died here, up close with my lament on the transcendent, didn't anticipate getting cluster fucked by so many wyverns. Whilst down my team failed to killed them quick enough, they despawned and the strike ended as it would normally.


Has this happened to anyone else?

raidsecrets,"Savathûn's Song - I think Eris is either lying to us or misinformed, and we've been hearing it for a lot longer than a year","The Whisper is one of my favorite bits of Destiny content ever. I probably did that mission 50 times, taking friends through the various versions. I solo'd it a bunch of weeks for chest progress and catalysts. I listened to the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7o6Y3Tw5Zg) at work like a weirdo. This mission debuted with Warmind, and is generally though of as us proving ourselves to (or conquering) Xol in order to earn him as a weapon, in the Whisper of the Worm.

Last season, most of the focus was on Deep Stone Crypt, Beyond Light brought us new musical themes, and the seasonal stuff like wrathborn hunts fell a bit by the wayside. But something stuck out to me in the Hawkmoon/Harbinger mission. [Take a listen, and pay attention to 1m24s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRbPxd5dHxQ). We've heard that [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7o6Y3Tw5Zg&amp;t=668s). But I always thought of ""A Thousand Wings"" (Whisper music) to be ""Xol's theme"". Interestingly though, take a listen to the actual [boss fight music against Xol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhUh-mnKEMw). Okay, it's a banger, but this motif *is nowhere to be found*.

This also shows up in Shadowkeep, namely in Garden of Salvation vs. the [Consecrated Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp4PkKiqlqk) (both phases). It plays loud and clear, plain as day at 1m50s. What we have been *told* is Savathûn's Song also plays here - it even opens the first phase, and it also plays in the Consecrated Mind boss fight music. This particular theme doesn't appear there, and I think that will be important, but I don't yet know how. Savathûn and ""the darkness"" are certainly intertwined, but are *not the same thing*, and I think we could argue that the Beyond Light theme may actually be our first proper theme for ""the darkness"".

Now this season it is *FUCKING EVERYWHERE*. Hangar action music in the [Presage mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcdYhKmecVM) (first debut at 1m9s - however, note it doesn't appear in the boss fight music against the Locus of Communion), and it plays in the music when you are in The Pit lost sector in the EDZ as part of the Contender's Ascent IV quest (from week 4 of the current season). This motif has more appearances now than even the Traveler's theme (I think most recently shows up in Heretical Omen from Pit of Heresy) or the guardians' theme (shows up briefly in the boss fight vs. Taniks in DSC).

Today I stumbled across the music from the intro mission to the [Forsaken campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCkZy4Dwr0). Skip ahead to Action 2 and take a listen. We now know the events of Forsaken to have been orchestrated by Savathûn, enacted via Riven. It's worth nothing that, to my knowledge, this motif does not show up anywhere in the Last Wish raid. But you know what? We have actually run in to it before. Guess where.

#[Savathûn's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMlLKnbACII)

This kinda feels like Bungie has been screaming at us for the last year to try to get us to pay attention to this; it's starting to become ridiculous as we draw closer to The Witch Queen, and I would expect it to keep cropping up.

I don't think we've been hearing ""Savathûn's Song"" since Shadowkeep. I think we've been hearing it since the Red War and Eris either doesn't know or is misdirecting us re:Shadowkeep theme.

This has some disturbing implications. It kind of re-contextualizes the Whisper of the Worm mission. It's less us ""earning"" the power to wield Xol, and more him being fed to us by Savathûn. I think it may also tie everything together about why we are able to visit the Glykon, considering the Crown of Sorrow is onboard, a direct link to Savathûn, and represents her control... and I'm sure there are other implications I have missed.",1615428183,2021-03-10 21:03:03

raidsecrets,Lore book Marasenna corresponds with various seasons and DLC's from the past/future.,"Bit of Spinfoil speculation: The lore book Marasenna almost perfectly corresponds to a season that was released either currently or previously, at least as far as I can see. I saw the lore entry Katabasis (21) and my mind went right to Presage and the guardian Katabasis we find dead at the end. If that lore entry corresponds to season of the Chosen, then we can work backwards to find what other entries relate to each season:

Katabasis the guardian/""moving downhill""==Chosen, it uses his name unclear about the definition

Imponent I-V ""One who imposes a rule""==Hunt, not clear perhaps the relationship between Crow and Spider?

Heresiology ""The study of heresy""==Beyond Light (which is why there is only 1 entry), we begin wielding the darkness and studying it, IE heresy against the light.

Fideicide I-III ""One who breaks trust""==Arrivals, the darkness arrives and attempts to shatter our faith in the light.

Ecstasiate I-III ""to enter a state of ecstasy""==Worthy, not clear

Cosmogyre I-IV ""the universe is spinning""==Dawn, not clear

Brephos I-III ""a newborn child""==Undying, not clear

Archiloquy ""The start of a speech""==Shadowkeep, the first DLC after Forsaken perhaps?

&amp;#x200B;

Then going the other way from katabasis we have:

Nigh I-II ""soon, nearby""==next season

Palingenesis I-III ""to be reborn, bring back tradition""==season after next

Revanche ""moving to reclaim lost territory""==Witch Queen

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have exact relations for each word to the season it corresponds to, but I'm not a linguist or very bright. We can clearly see there are 'onedrop' lore entries for when a DLC drops and a set of lore for a given season. I might be giving bungie a bit too much credit to think that far ahead, but the coincidence is certainly there at least.",1615403379,2021-03-10 14:09:39

You already know the story of the cutscene and others. But has anyone felt a pressure on the part with the stars? I mean, it took longer for the stars to disappear than the cutscene itself ( jk ). Something makes me feel like it's an cool easter egg or a puzzle.  
I made a post this year about Shuro Chi's stars found under the gazeboo. They had something special.  
In this cutscene we can see the close/same type of stars: Big and bright, small and less brighter then others and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I am saying that is an easter egg or a puzzle?**  
Early this season, Bungie released the Projections bundle. Witch had the exact same theme: **stars and symbols among the stars.**

Maybe that was a ""preview"" or a ""teaser"" for this cutscene, maybe the stars seen in the cutscene are the stars in the bundle. I didn't spend so much time to line the stars.  


**a puzzle?**

It maybe corelates to the post I made and stars from Shuro Chi in a way. I looked at one group of stars and it didn't look like any projection from the bundle, so they might have a different meaning. How ever, same we thought about DSC constellation on the reddit post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep\_stone\_crypt\_cutscene\_constellation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep_stone_crypt_cutscene_constellation/)

And then use that knowledge to better plan counters. I mentioned the armor because the Symbology and visual language of the new concept art reminds me of Braytech and Elsie's symbol.

( https:// imgur.com/a/aH5E5Zb )

This may be a bit of a reach, but I think its possible we could see something involving Elsie's timeline more heavily down the road. I think we could see a darker version of braytech armor that was salvaged from the ruins of The Bombardment. Or something a little less spinfoily maybe we will see Ada-1 and Elsie collaborating to make Stasis weapons and armor. Would love to hear your thoughts.

There a pipes at each boiler room entrance you can sit on and wait for the locus to come to you, sit on these pipes and jump in and out of the entrance to get his attention, then use felwinters and xenophage for damage with a stasis super for ads.

reasons for returning:

as we destroyed the nukes theres no defences for the crypt any more in DSC deepdive they said ""we are now the defenders of the crypt""

We timed it out, joined the other fireteam during the launch and were able to join together. However we can't get past the ""Searching for Guardians"" screen. We can all see each other and it says 5/3 Guardians. It fades to black as if the strike is going to load, only to reload the ""Searching For Guardians Screen"" after a few seconds, fades to black and reloads the ""Searching for Guardians Screen.""

[player 1] will promote [player 3] to fireteam leader, and then [player 1] and [player 2] will leave the fireteam, splitting the group into 2 and 10.

[player 1] will now join on [player 2], and then [player 2] will promote [player 1] to fireteam leader. This is the most important step, and what caused our runs to succeed.

[player 1] will now get ready to launch the activity, and [player 3] will get ready to join on [player 2], bringing the whole group of 10. [Player 1] will now launch and call for [player 3] to join up a little before the launch timer reaches 2 seconds.

If done right, [player 1] should see “someone is joining your fireteam” around 0 seconds.

If not, [player 1] and [player 2] change characters or leave the fireteam and try again.

raidsecrets,The Nova Armor sets are 99.99% related to the DSC,"So let's start with a few other theories and then we'll get right to the proof:



So first off, the armor sets have the three most important alchemical elements written on them. If we look at how Clovis Bray treated his work in the DSC we can clearly observe that he was comparing his work to alchemy. Hell, he didn't even invent the term ""Alkahest"" it's just a mythical substance from, you've guessed it, Alchemy.




Then, if we look at the designs of these sets, it clearly looks like they are some kind of research or hazmat suits. The Titan one has some kind of vials near the shoulders and we can see some kind of rubber boots (On Hunter) and rubber undersuit (on every set)





And now, for  the actual proof, it consists of one single gun: Trustee. You can see that Trustee has some very similar symbols. Actually, most of the DSC weapons have these symbols, except the Succesion and Heritage.

raidsecrets,The Witch Queen Armour Symbols.,"It's already going around that the armour is themed around alchemy, elements and minerals ect...


with the hunter being mercury for mind, the titan being salt for body and the warlock being sulphur for the soul. (this fact was brought to my attention because of u/Hip_Hop_Kido)

&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to see if we could identify the meaning behind all the symbols... There's a lot of interesting references on the armour.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: The Star that appears on all three armour could be a reference to the seven pointed heptagram. ""In alchemy, a seven-sided star can refer to the seven planets which were known to early alchemists, and also, the seven alchemical substances: fire, water, air, earth, sulphur, salt and mercury.""


&amp;nbsp;


Hunter: 

&amp;nbsp;

Collar has triangles which mean Water ""🜄"" and Air ""🜁"", Mother and Son or Swords and Cups.


To the left and Right of the Collar is the atomic number (left) and atomic weight (right) for mercury.



On the boot is the Symbol for Mercury in alchemy ""☿"".


then what could be the seasonal symbol, a whirlpool? a flower? fish eating bait?

Then the symbol for Calcium Oxide which alchemists called ""Quick Lime"" ""🝁""


&amp;nbsp;



Titan:


&amp;nbsp;

On their chest is the symbol of salt ""🜔"" combined with another symbol.  A circle with two dots. The two dotted circle appears three times unmerged with salt, once on the gauntlet, once on the mark and once on the boot.


(Edit: This Circle with two dots is the symbol for sea salt, thanks for u/KittenAlfredo for pointing that out).


The shoulders have Na and Cl, the atomic symbols for Sodium and Chlorine which become Sodium Chloride aka salt.



The very top of the titan mark has 17 on the top left and 35.453 on the right which is the atomic number and atomic weight of Chlorine.


Lower down the mark are some symbols i cound't figure out followed by the symbol for bizmuth ""🜘"" and the symbol for crucible ""🝨"" merged together.


&amp;nbsp;


Warlock:


&amp;nbsp;


The faceplate shape is that of the symbol for air ""🜁"".


The chest has the strange symbol that appears on all three armours. It's surrounded by the symbol for philosophers sulphur ""🜎"", the atomic symbol for sulphur ""S"", The alchemic symbol for vinegar ""🜊"" and upside-down and incomplete version of the symbol for black sulphur ""🜏"" which may mean something else.



On the hips is the atomic number and atomic weight of sulphur. 16 and 32.066.



At the very bottom of the fabric is a completed and actual version for black sulphur ""🜏"". above it appear to be incomplete versions of the alchemic symbol for Phosphorus.",1614786090,2021-03-03 10:41:30

raidsecrets,Adding in new Butterflies to the game? Minigame etc,"Currently we have 4 different Butterflies in the game as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/m2LVUxA.png).  And when used on other players it actually gives them some cool buffs. 

I'd like to propose the idea of adding in more Butterflies to the game on the same scale as Implings — and perhaps even bringing out a Puro-Puro game for them as well. 

You could add Butterflies up to 85-90 Hunter that give run energy and special attack onto other places.  A Butterfly that grants Special Attack to others would be worth a lot of money.  If you are a tank or a support role and your main DPS missed his DWH spec, you could use this Butterfly on him and he can try again (all you have to do is use it on them, no trade screen).  It has uses for sure and would be at a cost — or be rare if you're an ironman (think d imp).

However, this is only one example at the higher end.  There's so much more you can do with Butterfly perks.  You could easily add in 8-10 more different variants. 

I know in RS3 you can barehand catch Butterflies for a bit of Agility XP too, however, we could simply make the rates much smaller in OSRS. 

Just wanted to propose a small idea that I think could add more incentive to the Hunter skill. Butterfly perks as a whole are quite interesting and would play a great role in this economy and bossing meta.

raidsecrets,"If you have a full engram inventory, instead of the exotic armor piece from doing a solo legend/master LS, you get an exotic engram, which might decrypt into the armor piece from the other LS.","I was doing the legend LS, which is Bunker at 1300 PL today. I didn’t have any of the new exotic chests, so I was hoping to pick it up on all of my characters.

When I got to my Hunter, he had like 8 or 9 umbral engrams (they still kinda do drop frequently), and in the course of doing the LS, I eventually ended up having 10 in my inventory - full.

At the end of my third run (I had gotten the chest on my third run on my other two characters, so I was expecting it at the end of the third on my Hunter), I got an exotic engram. I figured that since I had a full engram inventory, it didn’t decrypt immediately and I knew it was gonna be in my postmaster.

So I go to the HELM to decrypt some umbrals to make space, and as expected, the exotic engram was in my postmaster.

I was afraid that maybe, because I wasn’t inside the LS, I was gonna end up with a random exotic I already owned.

But when I picked it up from the postmaster, it decrypted into the exotic arms that are available in the 1330 master LS. I hadn’t yet gotten them in my collection, so there was no way it would decrypt from a regular exotic engram, as far as I know.

I figure that the game knows that it’s an exotic engram from a LS, but it doesn’t distinguish from legend or master. So when you decrypt it, you have a chance of it decrypting into the exotic from the other LS.

I did go back to the Bunker to try and get the chest, and I got it on my second run. It decrypted immediately cause my engram inventory was no longer full.",1614441381,2021-02-27 10:56:21

raidsecrets,12 Man Raids (or other activities),"Big thanks to Scrub for finding this.

Split into 2 teams with the leaders as physically close to each other as possible (for lower ping), one with 5 people and one with 7 people.

Have the 5 person team launch into the raid. Have them call out when the countdown hits 2 (you may need to change that number based on how fast the connection is). The leader of the 7 person team needs to join the 5 person team, wait on the screen that says ""bring fireteam with you"", and when the leader of the 5 person team calls out you click ""bring with me"". If done correctly you will get into the raid with 12 people, but it is really tight timing.

If you end up with a 12 person fireteam in orbit, you need to join a little later. If you end up with 5 people in the raid you need to join a little earlier.

Good luck, it is really fun!

Note: Make sure the launching fireteam has 1 slot open for every joining fireteam, staying within the original player limit. For example, for nightfalls, have 2 people in the fireteam. Have another fireteam with 10 people. I have only tested it with raids, but I think it works in other places as well.

raidsecrets,I think the witch queen armor stand for the three darkness subclasses!,"Everyone probably has seen the newly revealed ""The Witch Queen"" expansion armor.

Well i did some research, and i found some things worth noting.

First of all the middle guardian armor references Sodium Chloride or salt,

The right represents Sulfur and we can also see that it has the atomic number of sulfur.

The left one has number 80 the atomic number of mercury.

What many of you probably don't know is that alchemist start their journey at their body(Salt) to purified it to true salt with the other elements. They are btw called elements.

Now the salt element is explained as follows:

salt stands for condensation, crystallization, and the underlying essence of a body.

Kinda sounds like stasis to me, us starting out on this darkness adventure unlocking the darkness within ,becoming literally frozen and then breaking the ice to unlock our darkness powers. In alchemy they also believe you have to break down your body to get to the core because your body or salt as they believe is made out of mercury and sulfur. If this is indeed right this could mean the others are upcoming darkness subclasses

The other 2 are explained as follows:

\-(mercury) mercury was thought to transcend life/death and heaven/earth.

\-(sulfur) Sulfur was used to denote the expansive force, evaporation, and dissolution

I think the mercury one will be the next subclass because mercury is all about the mind like Savathun she sought to transcend life and death with Nokris and in the presage mission we hear the voices of the dead. The prophecy dungeon has a place called heaven and hell which reminds me of the heaven and earth.

And also what does a witch do she makes poison,many us expect a poisonous subclass in the witch queen expansion. What is mercury? Very poisonous.

And then in lightfall we will probably unlock the sulfur subclass, the core darkness one , what does the darkness do? it expands, evaporates and dissolves the light.

Also about salt being stasis, look at how beyond light focused on exo's ,literal bodies made out and vex milk and they later added darkness(clarity) but still the exo bodies do have certain malfunctions and degrade over time. Of course if we follow the alchemical explanation that is very logical because the body (pure) salt is build out of mercury (mind) and sulfur(spirit) what is it that the exo's have problems with, their memory mind and their spirit/personalities that change. Which aren't like they should b hence the malfunction.

&amp;#x200B;

[ErrantStriker](https://www.reddit.com/user/ErrantStriker/) also pointed out that the seven pointed star and/or the seven armed galaxy   could be referring to the 7 planetary metals in alchemy and considering that 6 of the 7 planets mentioned are, or at least where, in game, wether directly or via their moons, leaving Venus as the only one that isn't in game (yet).

Yeah, 1 of Season of Dawns Psion Flayer Sundial Bosses is hidden in plain sight in Season of the Chosen. 
Ozletc is one of the Psions behind a barrier on the 2nd Objective of Battleground Oracle. 
Looking into the room doesn’t show any names, even if scoped in. When the objective is complete, she runs near the barrier, disappears and then the barrier itself comes down. 
You can only see her name from inside the room before the objective is complete.


The description of Battleground Oracle reads, 
A group of former Red Legion Psions are communing with Vex prediction engines deep within Nessus. They seek to gain tactical insights by analysing simulations of future events against their own psychic foresight. Eliminate this threat before they can deliver their intelligence to Empress Caiatl.
Ozletc does get away..

If you’d like to check out my video about it, you can find it [here](https://youtu.be/Pk1bICZsFPM).

Now for a Text Tutorial.

With a bit of Sword Flying, Dawnblading, Salvation Gripping or Stasis Nade Platforming, you can get over the top of the barrier and drop inside the room. 
Its that simple. 
The 2 small Psions have no name but Ozletc does, and you can kill them all.
Ozletc has a big health pool like any boss. May be the same size health pool as in Season of Dawn.
Either way, they all stand there and don’t fight back but Ozletc may stomp you.
Have fun and we’ll see if Empress Caiatl actually does anything with that intel..

So, while the high-level experience remains the same, you should expect the raid team to have a few tricks up their sleeves when **you tackle the depths of Venus** this summer.

BUT, you will be stuck at the beginning, with the warsat no longer dropping (without the warsat, there's no way to continue the strike).

I think that everyone already acknoledged that the bugged part of the strike also counts as part of the strike. You will be stuck with your own instance of the cosmodrome, with randoms joining and leaving all the time. You can make use of this and complete bounties and/or other quests without teammates stealing your kills. You can use the Velles Labyritnh to farm enemies for catalysts.

Yesterday, I got stuck in this instance, and I realised that I could complete the Salvager's salvo quest. Just use Fighting lion!

TL;DR: The bugged instance of the Fallen saber can be used to complete strike objectives

Sounds like we are not only getting more story but more things are going to play out in the Glykon possibly. After all the name “Presage” essentially means a warning or omen for something bad about to happen.

raidsecrets,Morgeth Forever Fight Raid Challenge Cheese,"Building on the recent posts by u/fellowgamer837 and u/NonManifest, and the video from u/pastuleo23 a while back about damaging immune enemies with Stasis, me and some of my clan decided to do a bit of testing to see how much damage you could do to Morgeth using Lament and Stasis without killing him. This would allow the encounter to be started for a very quick kill and provide an easy way of getting the Forever Fight challenge (doing the encounter without killing the ogres that spawn).

Video of us starting the encounter and getting the kill here: [https://youtu.be/_ABcDNjLLXg](https://youtu.be/_ABcDNjLLXg)

A revved Lament heavy attack on Morgeth when he's frozen does 24,858 damage. My initial estimate based on measuring Morgeth's health bar turned out to be a bit off and we killed him the first time. We tried to do one attack fewer than that run but our numbers turned out to be a bit off because we also killed him the second time. 

I estimate that Morgeth has somewhere around a little over 3,604,410, because when we finally did it we did 145 revved heavy Lament attacks, which was enough to leave him with only a tiny bit of health. You could possibly do 146 attacks, but 147 was too many

After 145 attacks we started the encounter, hit him with Stasis again and did a few more sword hits. We rotated in and out for ammo as necessary.

Hope this helps anyone else who is still slowly creeping towards Rivensbane.",1614074736,2021-02-23 05:05:36

raidsecrets,"Possible ""Escape the Ship"" ending in Presage","Now, this is a shot in the dark and I've been holding on to this for the last week to see if anything new comes up, but seeing as nobody's mentioned this, here goes nothing.

To start, we should have our expectations straight. Presage is obviously a puzzle mission with much higher polish and attention to detail than previous missions like it, so brushing things off as coincidence or existing ""for no reason""/etc should be the last conclusion we come to. 

In this mission, we have two main types of physical doorways we use to navigate the mission: classic Cabal ship doors and maintenance hatches. The first point of curiosity came when my s/o and I did the mission for the first time- in the first puzzle room, there is a second Spore that allows you to go back through the spore door back to where you started, up on the platform above the second wave of Screebs. Curious, because you can entirely ignore this spore when going for solo flawless, and there's a maintenance hatch next to it that matches 3 maintenance hatches used to progress through the room.

When we did the mission the second time to get our random rolled Dead Man's, she noticed you could open the giant door at the beginning of the mission from the inside. Looking out, and seeing your ship out there? It looks just like the end of a story mission where we have to run to your ship, like we did in Taken King and Beyond Light. On top of that, the Spore door in the same room can be accessed from both sides. That makes 2 spore doors that can be accessed from both sides, so that can't not mean something...right?

The last piece of evidence I have towards this idea is the only other Maintenance hatch I've found so far that seems out of place; at the very end of the Hangar segment, by the ship you have to jump on. Considering there's a Crown of Sorrows room underneath the bridge of the ship, it may connect back somehow. 

We still have to get Katabasis's Ghost. We may end up having to just grab it and run..",1614061981,2021-02-23 01:33:01

raidsecrets,Savathun's Song not included in... Savathun's Song,"I recently ran through Garden of Salvation and I noticed Savathun's Song was everywhere during the boss encounters music. [During one of your confrontations with The Consecrated Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft3kZcoTjzg), [as well as the fight against The Sanctified Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCae_Cj9aTM), the full, complete 8 notes pop their ugly head in our legendary battles with the Vex (Both found at the beginning of each of their respective Phase 1s, as well as later in the songs themselves). After this horrifying revelation, I thought to myself: What about that one strike on Titan? The one where Taeko-3 dies? Wasn't that shrieker's name Savathun's Song? Is Savathun's Song in [Savathun's Song?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjDFqEp5bac) 

With my semi-trained ear I couldn't find it anywhere in the song. It's sad, sure, but I'm not super surprised that this motif isn't found in one of the vanilla strikes, as that would've taken a considerable larger amount of foresight and planning, and I'm assuming planning 2 years in advance still takes a lot of effort.

However, I'm not entirely convinced that there isn't ANY reference to Savathun's Song. I mean the strike's boss's name is ""Savathun's Song,"" that in of itself is a reference to the approaching Savathun. I also know there are ways to hint at a melody without playing the actual melody. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K-9Ekzc2A) video from a Youtuber I enjoy watching points out (specifically from 13:07 to 14:11, but I recommend watching the entire thing) that one can take a handful of notes (Let's say, D F G E C E F B for example, because those are the notes in Savathun's Song) and play them backwards, or in a different key, or any other combination of modifications. My issue is that I don't have the sheet music to any of these arrangements, because if I did I might be able to do it, but I don't think any of the songs we would need/want to analyze have published sheet music, and I know that by the time that I transpose it myself the Witch Queen AND Lightfall will already be released because most of my musical experience comes vicariously through that Youtuber I cited and I would probably give up before I ever do anything. Hence why I'm asking y'all for help. Where else can we find Savathun's Song? Other than the places that already have been mentioned (Namely all of the instances found in [Byf's video from last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP28-xqkH1w), and from the Garden of Salvation), is there any other places that this lil' dity?

I do want to add something before I post, a theory/very educated guess: Savathun's Song is in the Garden of Salvation because Salvation was trying to corrupt us. I think this is already well established, as we know Lisbon-13 turned and embraced his Shadow-clone, found [here](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/legacys-oath-plate?highlight=Lisbon-13), and I assume that Savathun was trying to do the same to us.

The definition of the word 'presage' is ""to be a sign or warning that something (usually something bad) will happen"", or it can be used as a noun. In this case quite literally, the mission is a presage for... what, we're not quite sure, but it's very interesting that the mission's name marks it as an omen.

It may be presaging the arrival of The Darkness, or I believe a new, Darkness-adjacent hivemind species, as indicated by the buff we receive in the quest, Egregore Link, which seems to ""attune"" us so we can pass through what are seemingly similar to barriers of psychic energy. An egregore is more than just a non-physical entity, it's a collective projection of thought and energy, which may be the creatures the Darkness has bonded with as a physical extension of its power.",1613897518,2021-02-21 03:51:58

raidsecrets,"How to do 1,500,000 Damage with Thundercrash [Video Included]","**TLDR**: [1,500,000 Damage Thundercrash - Destiny 2 Season of the Chosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-3DhYsGYN4) (Philly was just there to hold the boss in place, he did nothing else, aka ""The Fluffer"")

This method requires 1 non-thundercrash user but the debuffs will stack onto more thundercrash - Theoretically you could hit 7.5m damage with 5 titans + 1 stasis user.

We tested this number at Karl and the Lake of Shadows boss, but the footage is just from Karl.




**Loadouts Used**

*Titan(s)*

* Cuirass of The Falling star
* Volatile Conduction (Artifact Mod)
* Focusing Lens (Artifact Mod)
* Something to redbar yourself on command, we used Mountain Top. Ricochet rounds would be more practical

*Other (In this case, Stasis Hunter)*

* Stasis Subclass w/ Duskfield grenade
* Divinity
* Sundering Glare




**Why Does This Work?**

There were a lot of little nuances that went into getting this right, the damage comes from a very specific string of events. 

The duskfield grenade is meant to freeze the enemy with a delay (a 3rd person can be used to throw a coldsnap instead right as titan is about to hit if you can't get this timing down). Once the debuffer throws the duskfield they immediately start tapping divinity - We are tapping to reduce the chance of breaking the target out of stasis. The reason we use duskfield for the delay is so that the divinity cage can proc as well as sundering glare (Divinity can proc sundering glare off its own cage). The tricky part is getting the timing right for the Titan(s), you have to hit the target while they are frozen for maximum damage (780k vs 975k) and that window is really small.

The reason this works is thanks to the [3.1.0 Patch Notes](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50097) including the following:

&gt; When frozen by Stasis, AI combatants now take 5% more damage from Special-ammo weapons, Heavy-ammo weapons, and non-Stasis abilities. 

We aren't entirely sure how the math checks out when going from 780k -&gt; 975k impact but someone can probably figure that part out. We assume it is because the 5% buff to abilities is applied first in the calculation. The rest of the damage comes from Divinity (30%), Sundering Glare (20%), Focusing Lens (20%), Cuirass of The Falling star (100%), and Volatile Conduction (30%).

We calculated the 1,500,000 number including the tick damage with a little bit of math because Karl or the LoS boss didn't have enough health. We took the base impact damage (150k) and determined ours was 6.5x higher (975k / 150k = 6.5). With that we scaled up the base damage with ticks from 225k to about 1.5m (225k x 6.5 = ~1.5m). Realistically, the damage is probably closer to 1.2m or 1.3m after ticks unless you can keep your target frozen for the duration of the ticks.




**Final Thoughts**

This is a niche application but there may be scenarios where it will work, the main requirement being that the divinity person has to  be far enough to proc Sundering Glare - If you add more people to the equation it becomes easier to perform. The problem with adding more people is that you quickly do less damage than if you just had 2 Thundercrashes. 

The biggest thing making this hard to accomplish is the tiny window you have to hit the boss while frozen before they break out or Divinity breaks them out. If you can control that better, you can more reliably hit the big number. However without the frozen buff, you can still hit 780k impact (~1.17m with ticks), which is still a very large number.",1613870293,2021-02-20 20:18:13

As we know, Titan (which had 1 of the plates behind that door) was vaulted and we thought they might just remove or move them or something. After a few minutes, my friend called me under a gazebo to show me something that was shining, there was a “galaxy design” but with a few stars brighter then others. Shining, fading and doing their animation. My friend told me there should be something.. maybe a puzzle or something, I called him crazy at first, even tho- he was kinda right, the stars were a bit suspect at this point. My mind was like: This raid is old, there should be a post or something here, right? I couldn’t find any. But, I wasn’t really into this theory. After a while, I was thinking if there could be any puzzles left or any easter eggs besides 15th wish. After a while, there it was:

**Beginning:**

I was in my physics class (don’t ask) when I was thinking about the star map (https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLuETOCJ3rwAYy-IoYYxD-C\_bg1yQ8uvup&amp;v=k9QJEoxcPjo) that Shuro Chi presented us in a patrol mission. I linked it to trailers based on: Dreaming, **Stars**, Future, Curse and other key words. I was marked by: “**That map isn’t just decoration**”. Which made me think about other decorations that can lead to something. Maybe the stars found in Shuro Chi encounter?..

**Finding a ramp:**

After school I went to Shuro Chi encounter in Last Wish raid and thought about possible position of the stars. Why you might ask. Because, apparently all these stars are in a different place then the others. The stars are not disappearing (just fading), or moving. Some are brighter then others (like in real life), but It isn’t just decoration.. At least I feel like it. I took some screenshots and move it to photoshop where I tried to highlight with a different color and try to link them. But before that, I found others interesting things. Like:

**Shuro Chi standing place is part of the “star map”? (**I think that was known before, I couldn’t find it tho-**): https://imgur.com/a/qDE1Qnh**

**Shuro Chi plates has a design like wish plates (**Old and known, but might be useful in the future**): https://imgur.com/a/VLD5HSM**

**Stars are visible in the dark side of the Whisper of the Worm scope (**Some other light are visible too, but others.. even brighter, are not**):  https://imgur.com/a/8LppR0D**

**https://imgur.com/a/WXSoIcH**

(Not necessary helpful but It might say something about the lighting effect of the stars) 

**And more things like that (I will update this list if needed).**

**Theory 1** 

The stars are actually constellations from real life. We got the 4 categories in the “wall of wishes” symobl list: Fish, Dragon, Eagle/Bird, Snake. And we got constellation for every category AND some versions of it:

**FISH (Pisces): https://imgur.com/a/gXcGhHu**

**EAGLE (Aquila): same link**

**DRAGON (Draco): same link**

**SNAKE (Serpens): same link**

**..and some derivations of their main constellation like: Flying fish, water snake and others.**

Maybe we can link the stars from the gazebo in a pattern like the stars in real life and find symbols from wall of wishes. That can lead to a code that opens something if you introduce it in wall of wishes not necessary “15th wish”, mby?

**Theory 2**

The stars don’t relate to the stars in real life and we have to link them ourselves in order to find the correct symbol.

For example (from real life): https://imgur.com/a/42jaRvw

I found a dragon inside this gazebo: https://imgur.com/a/InO4qrS

This can be an infinite snake: https://imgur.com/a/XucFmOe

And the list goes on.

That was the first thing that I thought about. Maybe I wasn’t wrong, maybe I was.

**Theory 3**

Maybe we can make a map out of this stars which can lead up to somewhere on dreaming city. Why is that a possible Theory? Due to the fact that if you watch the map of the dreaming city, we can see some white stars similar to the gazebo stars

What I mean:

**Why I believe it can lead up to something?**

I think we can get something out of this because, as we know, Bungie left us with a “teaser” or maybe a hint linked to 15 eyes in a cutscene in the middle of the space, like a constellation. It was related to 15th wish. You can read more about this in this reddit post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep\_stone\_crypt\_cutscene\_constellation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep_stone_crypt_cutscene_constellation/)

Maybe Bungie tried to remind us about this little “puzzle”. Also, any progress on the Deep Stone Crypt Theory? Let me know.

Also, these gazebos are different from the others, not even Petra’s have those type of stars.

Maybe we can also form a constellation on that DSC constellation and link to Shuro Chi’s stars, somehow.

**Making of the code**

Ok, let’s pretend it is an possible theory. But.. How can we make a code after that?

Let’s say we include it in the wall of wishes. How are we sorting the code?

**Methode 1**

Some gazebo have a circular part around it: https://imgur.com/a/hRquntZ

We can consider it like a sorting mechanism where these parts represents the fact that the symbol is in the middle of other 4 symbols or 4 spaces.

Or, we can consider the little lamps some sort of positioning order or something like that.

**Methode 2**

We place it in the order of the encounter and position on the map. In different position based on the level of the gazebo and other place factors.

**Methode 3**

We can place every stars and make a map out of it which in that situation we can’t use wall of wishes out of that. Or we can unite only the brighter stars.

**Methode 4**

We link every gazebo and paste it inside the wall of wishes, after that we can count the number of bullets we need to use based on stars that are filled in the circles.

**We can try everything to sort it.**

**Conclusion**

This could be a great puzzle if it is supposed to be like that. Hope you understand what I am saying cuz I don’t have a great english overall. I hope this will lead to something, else.. I will get Therapy.",1613771222,2021-02-19 16:47:02

I particularly remember it being on NvUs Gaming's channel. I think it could be done in The Barrens on Mars somehow involving an out of bounds where you jumped into the ceiling, and somewhere on earth. The glitch allows you to duplicate your hitbox, damage other players, and causes enemies to not see you. I believe it also caused other players to not be able to see you or show your hitbox as loading.

I've wanted to learn this for a really long time and have done a lot of research but haven't had any luck. If anyone knows anything I'll be super grateful :)",1613707103,2021-02-18 22:58:23
raidsecrets,Captains Log Lore page states first location of a Glykon Smuggler’s Compartment,"After your second completion of Presage quest (i.e. when you received your first Dead Man’s Tale with a random role), you will also receive your first piece of lore aka a page of the captains log. The final paragraph reads as follows: 

‘FRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Smuggler's switches still working. Maintenance side-hatch. Had to kick in the vent.’

This, quite clearly, is a clue to a smugglers compartment stated in the ‘Tucked away’ triumph. 12 lore pages suggests 12 smugglers compartments.

These compartments seemingly are attributed to the yellow-rimmed screens found lying around the place. In your next run, you’ll find that the first of of these you come across can now be activated, opening a door and revealing a chest (which for me contained an ‘at power level’ piece of gear). After finishing this run and after a lot of snooping, there are in fact 12 of these pads lying around throughout the mission, which adds up. Sadly however, you don’t get another piece of lore if you complete it again. My guess that it is going to be 1 captains log page per week.

By checking on Light.gg, each of the log books does have a clue at the end of it, lets hope 12 weeks of effort is worth it!

Other notable items I found that seemingly will be scanable in the coming weeks are; 

- a yellow data pad in the room with the large cabal ship, after the room with the two ultra abominations
- a dead scorn which appears to be on an examining table 
- a dead ghost in the area before the rally flag point
- a chalice under the walkway in the very final room

From what I’ve been able to see so far, the majority of players are wiping during the Trash Compactor encounter, forcing them to reset their runs again and again.

This is largely due to the RNG factor which the spawning/ placement of where the fuses will appear. Every time the compactor fully “closes” and then resets, the fuses have a chance to move.

So here’s a way that I discovered to just eliminate all of those problems in one go:

So I was just doing the usual Strike playlist, nothing to crazy, but then i got loaded into a strike somewhere in the tangled shore, no dialogue, no indication of a mission, nothing.  


The strike started in one of the crashed Dreadnaught ships, there was only one wy deeper, with a bunch of Hive worshipping their worship like they always do.  
Me and my fireteam consisting of random players proceeded to kill them, but then there was just nothing else to do, only a door with a giant seal on it.   
I looked around there to find a way deeper in there, or some way to carry on the strike, but there was nothing.  


Then i tried backtracking, and i ended up in the Jetsam of Saturn, once there i saw some of these wierd bubbles, like some hive broodcells. I shot them and once i did that my game just crashed, and I had no way of returning to that strike.  
I looked for it on the Tangled Shore, as well as the other Destinations (just to be safe, not that i excpected it to be there)

The Darkness is a prime example of this. Since 2014, The Darkness has been the main antagonist of the Destiny Universe but was never directly addressed in major story plot points until Destiny 2's post credit cutscene. Before then it was only mentioned and talked about in grimoire cards back in D1. On the topic of 'The Darkness' and Grimoire cards... Take a look at the image of this Grimoire card called 'The Darkness' from D1.

Do you see it? Look at how undeniably similar the artwork from the card and the new environmental assets in the quest are. They are almost identical if not the same thing. The spores are glowing blue and growing from a foundation just like in the image from the card. The vein/tendril looking things are also sprouting from them just like on the image of the card as well the in game ones. Coincidence? I think not... However we are not done yet. Now it is time to connect these things with the darkness itself.

After shooting these spores you gain an effect called 'Egregore Link'. When you have this effect you are able to pass through these glowing, burning barriers which Osiris calls darkness radiation or energy. Now what is an Egregore? A quick google search:

**Egregore** (also spelled **egregor**; from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) *égrégore*, from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language) *egrḗgoros* 'wakeful') is an [occult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult) concept representing a distinct [non-physical entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity) that arises from a collective group of people. Historically, the concept referred to angelic beings, or [watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(angel)), and the specific rituals and practices associated with them, namely within [Enochian traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian_magic).

Very interesting stuff... Non physical entity? Sound familiar? The darkness has been described many times in lore to be a non physical entity. What is 'Enochian traditions'?

**Enochian magic** is a system of [ceremonial magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_magic) based on the evocation and commanding of various [spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit). It is based on the 16th-century writings of [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee) and [Edward Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley), who claimed that their information, including the revealed [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian) language, was delivered to them directly by various angels. Dee's journals contained the [Enochian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian), and the tables of correspondences that accompany it. Dee and Kelley believed their visions gave them access to secrets contained within the [*Book of Enoch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch).

Could this be a hint to our next set of powers? Very interesting stuff. The second word, 'Link' of the effect 'Egregore Link' seems to suggest that we have connected with this fungus or infection, spiritually to allow us to pass through it's barriers. Without it we seemingly burn when touching the barrier. Now look at the effect around the borders of your screen when you have this effect applied to your guardian:

Where else have we seen this effect before? Take a look at these...

That's right. The pyramid's barriers which Ghost also calls a massive energy spike. Does this connect whatever these tendrils and infestations are with the darkness directly? Going by the Grimoire card image resemblance to the in game assets as well as the visual connections with the pyramid's barriers, I think it is safe to say that there is definitely a deliberate connection here. However there is still one more thing to discuss...

The Drifter.

There is only one other place that we have seen these tendrils before and it is inside the Drifter's ship. Take a look at this.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TmuDR-wiiX4NRAttHIXv4k3Yp57iMPI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TmuDR-wiiX4NRAttHIXv4k3Yp57iMPI/view?usp=sharing)

You see them? Back in season of the drifter, you could go around the back of his ship to an icy area with these tendrils again and a tent with a tape recording in it. In the lore that came with season of the drifter, the Drifter explains and describes a trip that he went on with his crew to an icy planet. On this planet he said there were creatures that emitted an aura of pure darkness which repressed light. When they got close, his crew members lost their light and died in their sleep to the cold. The ice surrounding the room with the tent in it could be bungie trying to show a basic visual description as to what this place looked like. Throwing the container tent in there could also be a direct reference to the tent they were sleeping in whilst on that planet. Unfortunately I do not have an image of this room but I'm sure there are various videos out there where you can see it. Here is an image in the gambit prep room.

So what does this all mean? Could this be the start of a new enemy race being foreshadowed? When could we expect to see these creatures that drifter saw? Judging by the story direction I think Lightfall is the most likely candidate for when we'll see these things arrive. This is all very interesting and quite deliberate referencing from bungie and so I definitely believe that we are in some state of foreshadowing for bigger things to come... and this is only the beginning. Expect more small hints as the seasons move forward whether they are physical or visual representations in game or through lore.

One last thing I forgot to mention is the black armoury papers' description on these creatures as well. 'Smell of wet earth and sound like a machine being stretched and then compressed'. This is some concept art from bungie on something that fits this description. Also when you are moving throughout the mission's tunnels and small spaces you can hear groans and breathing which fits this description of the papers. Whether those noises are from that scorn boss or not it still sounds rather distinct. However this could be a stretch.

Thanks for reading my post, let me know what you think.

Ps. If anyone from Bungie sees this, tell the talented team that they did an amazing job with this quest. From visuals to storytelling, sound design and gameplay. Pure Awesomeness. This is what makes Destiny unique. Keep it up!

In the dark maze area (you know the one where you drop down through the floor with the effect active) there is a small door that looks similar to the trash compactor door.  To open it, Proceed as you normally would in the maze to complete it. As soon as you pull the lever that is found immediately after exiting the maze, go back in the maze and find the door before the effect wears off. It’s now open. It opens a hallway with a small window that requires the effect to get through. Get the effect and go through. Unfortunately it’s completely empty and a dead end.

raidsecrets,How powerful is our guardian and how under-powered/leveled are other guardians in-game?,"So I want to start off by saying that our Guardian is probably the highest ""power"" level of any of the guardians besides the vanguard and the main cast (Osiris, Ana, etc) maybe even more powerful than them. 

At the start of the red war (Making a new character) everyone had the same armor, weapons, etc. However, as time progressed and we've gained more powerful, no other guardian seem to be anywhere close to our power, which has been bothering me for a while. Our guardian has high stat/high quality armor and gear. Our weapons are extremely good and we almost always have an exotic and always have at least 3.

We've seen other in-game characters like the Dredgen in that Drifter cutscene and now we've seen another guardian (the one in the new mission) The Dredgen uses the makeshift Thorn, and Shards and other Legendary gear but he has been around a while to know Drifter and about Shin. However, the guardian in the new mission is using all WHITE or Common gear but he had an exotic. So that begs the question, if the ordinary guardian is still using white/common gear than how overpowered is our guardian. 

That guardian in the mission wasn't a new light either, he had done quite a few runs of the Menagerie and is even well aquatinted with Calus; and again, he is using common gear, so I would say new lights are even worse off.  

Now I understand why the vanguard loses 9+ guardians in a simple strike, everyone/the average guardian, uses common gear...",1613613275,2021-02-17 20:54:35

Second I can't really recall, it was at a small drop down. Did not really figure out the way to open it.
Third one is in de dark ""maze"" part, where you have to smash all the panels to find your way. Activate the lever behind the energy wall, but go back and you'll see a different energy wall back in the maze part.

raidsecrets,[SPOILERS] The Presage variation missions and the Crown of sorrow.,"\[Note, this is both a data mine and a glitch post.\]

From the datamined voicelines and dialogue, there is a variation of the Presage exotic mission where you talk and investigate **with Caiatl.** The reason why she is here is that she wants to investigate what happened to her father, Calus, and capture/punish him. We investigate the ship with her and Osiris, but the voice lines mention **the crown of sorrow, and how it not only controls minds but merges them. I presume we later either find and investigate it or fight enemies corrupted by it, but again these are only presumptions.** Also, JLoughlen on Twitter went out of bounds and found the crown of sorrow on the Glykon.

Normally if you smoke grenade yourself, you get no melee energy.

Throw a smoke far away, run into it after it explodes.

When you become invis you will also get half melee energy. 

Because you didn't become invis immediately it thought you were an ally and granted melee energy. Doing this with a friend will give you a full smoke from the ally, then yourself. Combine this with 100 mobility and gamblers dodge and you can have infinite invisibility while solo. 2 smokes used then returned to 2 smoke charges. (2 halves + 1 Gamblers dodge every 11-14 seconds)",1613466592,2021-02-16 04:09:52

raidsecrets,Speculating on the Exotic Scout Rifle,"We know it is a Tex Mechanica scout rifle, and so is highly likely lever-action. This makes me think it will fire at a unique RPM for scouts, something like 100 RPM with higher, harder-hitting damage. It could be balanced by having to reload bullets individually into an internal tube magazine (a common design component of lever-action rifles). This would explain giving the rifle a (datamined) perk like “Cranial Spike” that gradually increases reload for chaining precision shots, as you would be able to rapidly hasten the process of individually loading rounds. 
The rifle probably has a magazine of around 14 bullets, and I honestly expect it to have very high damage for a scout rifle, if not closer to a hand cannon. The drawback of this high damage is probably a relatively slow fire rate (having to manually rack the lever to rechamber after firing) and a low zoom factor - the gun seems to have iron sights.
I’d expect some form of “Gunslinger’s Trance” perk allowing you to increase the RoF by chaining precision shots, allowing you to increase its versatility in PVE. 
Personally I just hope the levering animation and sound design are great. This thing should sound gritty and powerful, like it really kicks. Nothing fancy here.",1613432845,2021-02-15 18:47:25

I was doing a lost sector in europa when I noticed that there where new symbols in the Season of the hunt weapons, those where not there [Before the texture change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeF--Yk_Z18)  
They look hive like, recently Crow has been humming savathuns song, could this be a new puzzle being hinted?",1613194943,2021-02-13 00:42:23

raidsecrets,shit-post theory (not really),"To cut to the chase, what if our guardians are actually being ""corrupted"" by Savathun? And she's currently deceiving us to hearing other guardians like Crow and Shaxx whistle it. As our guardians know from Eris that's an enormous red flag. Assuming Savathun knows WE know, could it be possible we're actually being ""corrupted""? 

A reason why I think this is a possibility is due to how unbelievably powerful we are as guardians, killing gods and all that. As far as I'm aware, no one else (guardians specifically) has done that. Savathun obviously knows who we've killed, etc. So to me, it'd make sense why she'd use us as a pawn since we are so powerful. I don't see the traveler helping us since we sorta? sided with the darkness and achieving stasis.

Sorry for the super surface-level theory, I'm just curious if this could be possible. I also apologize if this has been posted a bunch before.",1613190626,2021-02-12 23:30:26

raidsecrets,Half-baked Savathûn theory,"Honestly, I don’t think this could be all that plausible, but I figured that sharing this theory could at least open up a discussion about what might be next. 

Savathûn, so I’ve heard, is the Hive leader (god?) of tricks, similar to Loki in the Marvel line of things, although Marvel has nothing to do with this theory. 

Savathûn’s song, having been around for almost a year I believe, in game at least, is supposedly an infectious tune, that burrows deep into the listener’s mind, and acts as a switch, once flipped, doing bidding for the host, in this case Savathûn. If she truly is the god of trickery, and we have a largely assumed Hive DLC approaching, could this all be a trick? 

Savathûn surely hates guardians, we’ve been there, figured that out for quite a long time. Thus, we keep hearing about the song, not always what it means (besides a few times), but we hear it. We hear it and know that whoever does so is infected, and sometimes, infected must be put down.

What happens when Savathûn decides to ‘activate’ one of these agents, one such like Shaxx, whose had his Ahamkara whispering into his ear for so long? We have to put them down, they are exiled, whatever we can do to make sure they won’t harm people. Recently, our semi-freshly revived avian friend has been whistling the tune to himself, but who would he have heard the song from? Shaxx has his bones, Eris has vast knowledge, but could have easily been corrupted by the eyes she’s placed within herself.

The point is, we have to deal with people when they’ve been ‘activated’, in a way that protects others. What if Savathûn is using this to her advantage? What if perhaps, the Crow isn’t whistling the obscure hive tune, perhaps Shaxx’s ‘Moon Cheese Song’ never happened, or if it did, perhaps it happened differently. 

What if we, as a guardian had heard the song, nobody else, save for the rest of us around on this post, and floating around the EDZ in orbit. What if we had been ‘activated’ already, and these tunes we’re hearing are Savathûn playing with us, turning our suspicions towards fellow guardians rather than her? 

Now for a really big stretch. What if Savathûn’s song had been with us for so much longer? What if her song was around when Cayde-6 died? Maybe Uldren deserved it, but what if like him, we weren’t thinking clearly ourselves? The Hive definitely have a connection with the black fleet, worshipping them, and Uldren just so happened to be corrupted by Riven herself, an Ahamkara just as the one that hangs above our Crucible master? Perhaps Uldren wasn’t just corrupted by ‘Darkness’, but rather Savathûn’s song? She’s already made deals with Riven before.

What if we are doing what she wants us to do? All of these things, where we’re hearing her tune burrow deep into our minds, where Shaxx sings for Saladin, what if they never truly happened that way? 

While the part about Forsaken is definitely not true, I think that there’s at least some small shred of information in here that may come true. We’re all hoping that the Witch Queen DLC has some extreme plot twists to play off of Savathûn’s nature, maybe this is it.


TL;DR: I think Savathûn has been controlling us, and the instances we here her song are false, her turning us against our own.

Thanks for reading this overly long, and half-baked theory, would love to here your thoughts!",1613177146,2021-02-12 19:45:46

raidsecrets,Hive Runes have apeared on Season of the Hunt Weapons,"I have noticed that hive runes apeared on the Season of the Hunt weapons ingame. I have found an 2 months old thread discussing these runes. However back then the runes could only been seen in the companion app. I just want to bring this up again, since they can be seen ingame now. 

I guess these are leading up to something that is going to happen before witch queen or to the expansion it self. Or maybe something completely different...

As per [patch notes 3.1.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50097), Enhancement Cores and Prisms now have a chance to drop from hidden chests in Last Wish, Garden, and Deep Stone Crypt. 

I demonstrate how to solo the first Raid chest in Garden of Salvation on all 3 characters in order to loot the chest for a chance at these materials.  Unfortunately, I was not lucky enough this time around.

I hope this guide helps new players trying out Season of the Chosen &amp; those looking to solo farm some Raid Gear and Materials.",1613130511,2021-02-12 06:48:31

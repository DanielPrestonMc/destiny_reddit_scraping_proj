And currently, 111 days and counting since he's sold it last.

Having so many mods and him being the only source of getting old mods is just an awful system.  He should, at the *very* least, have a second page where he sells 5 different mods a day.

I‚Äôm a concerned Warlock. No class in the game has had a subclass deleted but Warlocks(Sunsinger).

We get a new subclass Nova Warp and it gets mangled and forgotten about, it was left with the handheld supernova, that was shutdown along with the gauntlets. 

We get a new stasis super and it was a bit op in the beginning and it got mangled. Penumbral blast was like two feet and done, the super didn‚Äôt track anymore and it lost a lot of damage. You do nothing to bosses with that and only the abilities work well in crucible.

We have top tree Arc, the melee chain that got killed but Titans have boots that do pretty much the same thing ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs not dead or weakened. 

Now the only thing we had was Chaos Reach and now it‚Äôs going away. Why do you guys love killing off the Warlocks? Let us live a little.

DestinyTheGame,Can something finally be done with the pvp weapon balancing and ammo economy?,"If you don't play HC + sniper or HC + shotgun, you simply are at a huge disadvantage. It's really bad how we have so many weapon times and archetypes yet if you look at the top 15 most used legendary weapons in competitive PVP, you get :

* 7 HCs (5 are 120 RPM)
* 3 sniper rifles
* 3 shotguns
* 1 pulse rifle
* 1 auto rifle

And if you do consider exotics, in the top 15 most used weapons, 8 are HCs. Of those 8 HCs, 6 are 120 RPM. What sort of weapon diversity is this?!

Bows (beside certain exotics) are extremely bad and too vulnerable to flinch. Same thing for the majority of scout rifles beside DMT (low zoom = less affected by flinch and same/faster TTK as 120 RPM HCs). Autorifles, for the most part, are a joke and require too many shots to kill and constant fire so you can't peak-&gt;shoot-&gt;peak-&gt;shoot... which is a huge detriment. SMGs are essentially worse autorifles and are outclassed by slug shotguns which are outclassed by using buckshot shotguns while sliding toward your target. Pulse rifles have bad TTK (beside the 540 RPM achetype) and, for the most part, the same drop off as 140 RPM HCs so there's no reason to use them over HCs. 

Finally, remove scavenger perk effects in PVP. People are able to cruch too much on their special weapon and barely ever use their primaries (that's one of many reasons felwinter is #1 most used weapon and Astral Horizon is 4th most used weapon).",1615953665,2021-03-17 00:01:05

DestinyTheGame,Break down of elemental wells,"*all testing was done within the haunted lost sector Terminus East, on the EDZ, this was so i had a constant stream of enermies as well as various ranks, since the tribute hall disappeared*

first, they do not work in any measure for pvp, as the mods say combatants. And after testing within PvP there is no ifs or buts / work arounds that i found

now on to the fun stuff

# Basic mod function

every mods comes with this

&gt;Picking up an elemental well grants energy to your ability with the  lowest current energy. Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass damage type grants energy to ALL of your abilities

**Translation :** 

you'll see an discoloured orb of power on the floor pick it up and receive ability energy back.

~~pick up glowy orb on ground, get ability energy for your least charged ability~~

~~if glowy orb matches your glowy powers, get ability energy for all abilities~~

**Specfics :** 

from my testing you get a flat 10% of ability energy PER well with no cool down on this effect

this is the same with the matching vs unmatched with subclass just you get 10% to 1 ability vs 3,

this wells last 20sec from time of summoning, descent but i have wasted many a well because they can be lost in a sea of bodies

**Notes :**

* unlike the warmind cells there is NO way to generate wells without a mod that says it can
   * warmind cells say that ikelos and seventh serif weapons will summon a cell
* multiple mods have no effect

# Elemental Armaments

&gt;Weapons Take downs with a damage type that matches your subclass element have an escalating chance to spawn an elemental well

Translation : kills with a gun that matches your sub class will spawn a well,..... eventually

**Specifics**

this is a flat x amount of kills to spawn a well like with warmind cells, the perk description is VERY vague and misleading in this regard

with testing there is no difference between heavy, special, or primary weapons. they all take 7 kills to proc

further testing showed no difference in ranks, 1 kill is 1 kill

EDIT : forgot mod stacking doesnt work, 1 mod or 5 it still takes 7 kills

**Notes :**

* multi kills count fully, even risky and trinity's arc chains count
* Weapon Types dont matter Rocket launchers through side arms all the same 7 kills
* didnt test cursed thrall of explody shanks

# FONT OF MIGHT

&gt;Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass grants a temporary bonus to weapon damage of that same elemental type

**Translation** : if the elemental well is the same as your subclass any weapons that also match gain a temporary damage bonus

**Specfics** :

this is a FLAT 10% damage buff regardless of the weapon or enemy

this buff last for 5 sec and is capped at 5 sec, regardless

**Notes ;**

* stacking mods doesn't work 1 or 5 mods it's still 10%
* stacks with Debuffs
* as im a solo player with somewhat limited time i didn't have time to test this with buffs

# Elemental Light

&gt;Defeating a combatant with your Super spawns an elemental well that matchs your subclass energy type

**Translation :** super kills generate elemental wells

**Specifics :**

i dont know HOW this works but i believe there is a cooldown on the well spawning, 

* fist of havoc seemed to spawn a well every light attack but slamming seemed be capped at 1 well
* thunder crash spawned one well initially but as i lead red bars into the after shock more spawned

but any way this is simple kills in super generate a well that matchs your sub class

Notes :

* again mod stacking is useless

# Font Of WISDOM

&gt;Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass energy type grants you an temporary significant increase in your intellect, improving the recharge rate of your super.

**Translation** : Subclass matching wells grants increased intellect.

**Specifics :**

this lasts 30seconds,

this is HARD capped at that 30seconds, regardless of how many you pick up you just reset the timer

**Notes IMPORTANT:**

* i was unable to test the increase granted as the only way i choudl think to test this would be have a teammate generate wells for you
   * this is because kills will decrease your super regen time
   * if anyone has this data i would love to see it.
   * if anyone knows a way i could test this solo i would really want to know
* due to being unable to get solid numbers i dont know if mod stacking applies
* i apologise for all the missing info

# Elemental Ordnance

&gt;Defeating a Combatant with a grenade spawns an elemental well that matches your subclass energy type

**Translation :** grenade kills spawn a well.

**Specific's :**

nothing note worthy 

apart from there seems to be a cooldown between summons, 

grenade kills = elemental well

Notes : 

* no mod stacking
* grenades all share the same cooldown
   * so no top tree striker or Sunbracers spam
* i wonder if grenades and super share that cooldown

&amp;#x200B;

Last But not least

# Elemental Charge

&gt;Become Charged with light by picking up an elemental well. if the elemental well's element type matches your subclass you gain 2 stacks of charged with light

no translation needed this is exactly as it says.

**Specifics :**

this is very clear cut, just remember you NEED something equiped that can burn a charge with light to pick up a charge

i made that mistake, and yeah thought it was busted turns out im an idiot

**Notes ;** 

* should have put this at the start no mods stack as far as my testing has shown

# thoughts

***TLDR :*** *these mods arnt the best there a GREAT introduction into the combat style mod system and are FAR easier to obtain then the other combat style mods however they have glaring issues such as a lack of PvP function as well as being rather weak*

these are nice especially for players wanting to ability spam, in PvE

my biggest issue is the push for aggressive play as the wells spawn where the enemy dies limiting use in high end content.

BUT they feel limp there a great beginners guide to combat style mods but anything they do a charged with light or warmind cell can do and generally better

# as for PVP

i have NO idea why they arnt allowed, why didnt bungie make them spawn/work for PvP

**Stasis**

a non issue, its VERY difficult to spawn these with stasis so especially with no competitive stasis weapons, and all grenade kills hard as hell

* shatter doesn't count and using supers and sometimes be buggy due to how shatter damage and super damage aren't tied together, 
* titans have the greatest ease of summon, but it knee caps the HELL out of the super

Damage Buff

its 10%, and elemental dependant, making it VERY selective in usage

**Charged with light**

maybe, but apart from you know disabling that one mod, if it was broken

it also requires you to spec into summoning these wells, that means at least 2 well mods, and then 1 charged with light, thats at MINIMUM. 

i would recommend armaments and ordinance with charged, then sprinkle in high energy fire. **(if they worked)**

the issue is thats 4 mods and the energy required for them lost, let alone the missing powerful friends or Radiant light

&amp;#x200B;

I hope bungie keeps expanding these mods.

if you have any info you want to add please DM me or comment it.

DestinyTheGame,Let Armor drops increase by +5 each year of Destiny,"With Sunsetting now gone, there is no true incentive once people find their best sets of armor, and realistically, you aren‚Äôt playing an MMORPG if the endgame isn‚Äôt just completely nitpicking in specific aspects of loot like weapons and armor. Destiny now let us have our (new) loot for an infinitude periods of time but it‚Äôs loot structure will eventually plateau. As a player, what incentive do I have to look for other armor in the game if all the armor slots are either not compatible with what I want in my build or is just flat out worse than what I already have? I stated that gear would eventually just plateau, eventually it‚Äôll come to the point where everything is at its most potent which means I will have a total of total 433* (I don‚Äôt know if this allows a 400 total stat roll yet that probably requires optimization of builds) maximum potential stat points (season of the chosen)

(67 x 3 + 72 (exotic) + 50 (mods) + 20 strength + 20 mobility (Radiant Light and Powerful Friends) (also can add statsis fragments or mods in future content updates) + 12 x 5 for masterworked armor)

Armor stats are not allowed to be placed onto specific categories unfortunately so we‚Äôll all succumb to the eventually grasp of RNGesus which hiss behind any sort of random generation of numbers but an eventual addition of +5 to a stat will allow the player who has the potential 433 stat rolled armor to look for more pieces of armor and even then, with the heavily optimized armor, the player doesn‚Äôt have to switch to the newer gear! They‚Äôre allowed to stick with the old gear since there is next to no downsides to switching out the old with the new and vice versa, and especially with transmog, armor pieces are no longer limited by their appearance.

TLDR: Adding a +5 to all armor pieces can add new variety and a reason for veteran players who already have maxed stats to care about armor again.",1615951820,2021-03-16 23:30:20

DestinyTheGame,"While Destiny may have it‚Äôs issues, one thing that‚Äôs very admirable is the quality of exotic hand cannons.","Ace of Spades - Kill. Reload. Count 6 shots. Reload. Repeat. 6 shots that never fail‚Ä¶ Momento mori, my friend. 

Hawkmoon - A transformative weapon that you can hear the power of the Light through with every shot.

The Last Word - An old, reliable piece of iron that will never fail so long as you hit your shots, and learn to adapt to it‚Äôs unique shooting style. 

Thorn - A weapon as Dark as the souls of those struck by it. With every shot, you can watch as it devours your enemies and their very essences. 

Sunshot - A weapon as powerful as fire itself. Burning bright, always, and incinerating all in it‚Äôs path. 

Lumina - An old hand cannon reforged, from Sorrow into Hope. Instead of the power to drain the Light, it restores it. 

I really admire the quality of exotic hand cannons. While some, like The Last word (overshadowed by DMT) or Sunshot (overshadowed by Trinity Ghoul), may not be viable over other things, the quality of the guns and every shot I take with them always seems to amaze me.

DestinyTheGame,Special Ammo economy needs an adjustment,"Imo, one of the biggest problems with PvP, that‚Äôs been going on for a long time is special weapon ammo economy, mostly when it comes to ohk weapons.
There‚Äôs too much ammo for weapons that can be too deadly.

Even without scavenger mods, you can easily play a whole match with only your special weapon. And for how strong their ohk potential is, it‚Äôs stupid how much ammo you get.",1615949880,2021-03-16 22:58:00
DestinyTheGame,Pinnacle weekly rewards not dropping?!?!? STILL,"I play with a buddy constantly, he rarely gets his pinnacle rewards ever, he levels up from high end activity drops and he‚Äôs gotten to 1317, week after week..he never gets then. We just did 3 vanguard strikes with the matching subclass, I got the reward, he didnt. Ive posted about this multiple times, no one seems to know, he was going to buy the expansions but now wont even think about it, its getting absurd.

DestinyTheGame,Omnioculus infinite invisibility Nerf,"I've seen some posts about this get completely obliterated, so I thought I'd try to explain my reasoning  as to why this was a unnecessary move from Bungie. Most of the comments arguing for the nerf was because it was an unintended bug that was game breaking but the fact of the matter is the exact same infinite invis can still be achieved using travelers chosen. Not only that but I'd argue this combo is even more powerful than rat king because it not only returns melee energy but also grenade and dodge energy. I understand the support mindset Bungie had when they made this exotic but removing its synergy with rat king seems pointless if you can achieve an even more powerful synergy with another exotic still in the game. The reason I liked using rat king was the dark shadows theme it brought to the subclass. I'll miss you rat king, travelers chosen is the play now.",1615949710,2021-03-16 22:55:10

DestinyTheGame,In depth breakdown of light supers and what needs adjustments,"I was going to not post anything about any light subclasses tuning because I figured Bungie had their hands full with making stasis somewhat balanced in PvP, but since they decided chaos reach needed to be tweaked I guess asking for other subclasses to be looked at is fair game.

I only play as one character so I can't speak for titans or hunters but I know some of their light subclasses are severely underpowered against stasis (middle tree sentinel can't block stasis) or just in general so I invite them to post in the comments the things that need to be changed about theirs.

As for myself, I've been using nova warp almost exclusively since season of the chosen began, long before warlocks had their week of rebelling by using it (where did all of our motivation go after like 4 days guys? come on, this is why we suck at guardian games). I think I have a pretty good grasp of the shortcomings on the subclass as well as its strengths.

Neutral game: warlocks have a pretty generic middle game excluding top tree dawn, but nova warp has an interesting kit nonetheless.

* Hand held super nova: What was once one of the most broken abilities in crucible is now at best a shitty fusion rifle. There was an incorrect patch note that self damage was reduced to 25%, I can assure you that's not the case in PvP. Its charge time is excessive, its range is mediocre, and the low hold time means your timing has to be near perfect.  
Buff: lower charge time OR longer hold time, giving it both could make it overpowered
* Melee: Honestly a pretty good melee, it works sometimes to push away the other person out of melee range and they just swing at nothing, other times they lunge their melee into you and you die, meh  
Buff: Nothing, pretty balanced
* Dark matter: Honestly a slept on part of the tree. Kills with any of your abilities help recharge your other abilities and return health. This often will make it so you can take more than 1 shot from a handcannon after getting a kill with an ability and maybe get to cover.
* Nova Warp: Oh boy, this super has become a verb at this point. ""they're going to nova warp that super"". Translation: It's strong, and bungie's decision for nerfs is to take every part of what makes it good, and nerf each one of them individually.  
**Charge time**: there is no other roaming super in the game that requires you to charge.  
**Reduced movement speed while charging**: too much, I understand why this is necessary but the current movement speed while charging is like crouch walking  
**Dark Blink**: I've had situations where its cost me half my super to get to someone, the cost to blink is marginally too high, a minor reduction in super cost would go a long way  
**Explosion/Damage**: This will forever be a lopsided fight, it shouldn't be able to one shot other roaming supers yet it will never be able to get two explosions off before the other super can shut it down. That being said the range of the explosion could maybe be increased by a minor amount to allow the novawarp a chance to take them on  
**Miscellaneous**: I know comparing this super to behemoth titans isn't really a fair comparison but look at it like this, behemoth light attacks are more lethal than nova warp heavy attacks and actually offer mobility. I have fought countless behemoths in my super actually intentionally doing it at some points to see if there was some weakness novawarp could find. Spoiler: There is not. the light attack of the behemoth can actually allow the titan to escape the explosion of the novawarp. If the heavy attack connects, its over, if the light attacks connects, its over, if the light attack misses, the titan gets out of the damage area.  


Summary  
HHSN: needs the self damage reduction to actually work in PvP  
needs either a decrease to the charge time OR an increase to hold time  
Super: Of the following, 1-2 = still a meh super, 3 = a relatively balanced super, 4 = a top tier super  
Charge time of blast decreased  
Movement while charging is increased to not move at a snails pace  
Explosion range or damage is increased  
Dark blink cost reduced  
Dark Matter health regen is greater while in super?   


Once again I invite other classes to post theirs in the comments, I anticipate many of the comments will be unfriendly, and to those people I simply say, I hope your favorite subclass receives the nova warp treatment",1615948681,2021-03-16 22:38:01

As far as I'm concerned it's the most legendary D1 weapon.  Sure, others were sweet like the ghallahorn, but the hung jury was used by almost every player since it was so easy to get.

Doesn't seem very ""Indestructible"" to me. So, Is it supposed to be unable to be popped? It should at least get an HP buff or something because imo it is destroyed way too easily.",1615948477,2021-03-16 22:34:37
DestinyTheGame,5 Gm‚Äôs later..,"2 Adept Swarms and 2 Adept mods.

DestinyTheGame,Pinnacle drops in this game are broken.,"3 weeks ago, when i learned that GM nightfalls would be able to be farmed for adept weapons (i was out of the loop) i started seriously grinding pinnacles to reach 1310. That same week, i had 7...i repeat, 7 pinnacles in the same 2 spots. The only pinnacles that actually increased my light were the first 2 that dropped in their respective slots. I got a total of 4 chest pieces, and 3 legs, and only the first in each of those slots increased my overall light. The next week was nearly as bad, but with head pieces and kinetic weapons, with a total of 5 repeating pinnacles. Today, when i was excited for reset to maybe, finally reach 1310, i started pinnacle farming, and my first two pinnacles were bonds, with the first one dropping as a 1309 and the second dropping as 1308 (my base power is 1307). I logged off and switched to another game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bungie, this is demoralizing. There should be no reason for this amount of drop duplication from pinnacles. I get that you want people to keep playing your game all the time, and have reasons to come back every week, but negating HALF or more of my pinnacle drops does the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what to do about it? Honestly, i don't know. I don't know how difficult that is of an issue to address, or how to balance it so you don't reach pinnacle cap day one of a new season, but i do know that losing half or more of your pinnacles a week due to duplication, just out right breaks my drive to play.",1615947925,2021-03-16 22:25:25
DestinyTheGame,Help I unbinded Return to Orbit,"I unbinded return to orbit accidentally, how to I get it back. I am a keyboard.",1615947791,2021-03-16 22:23:11
DestinyTheGame,Eyes of Tomorrow and the Descendant Title,"This week makes it 54 looted clears without Eyes of Tomorrow dropping.

It's pretty disheartening that week after week, the rocket launcher won't drop when it's all I, and I assume many others, have left to acquire to complete the Descendant title. 

Titles are suppose to show the effort you've put into an activity, albeit the DSC title isn't too difficult, but at this point, I've been through a much fiercer battle with RNG than Taniks himself.

I know previous titles have had elements of RNG tied to them with collections portion like the Shattered Throne ship and Cursebreaker - but those I don't believe had bad luck protection, so there was reason to be disappointed when they didn't drop.

But it's been confirmed that Eyes of Tomorrow does have a cumulative drop chance, whether its an increase per account or per character every week, we don't know, but protection nonetheless.

At this point I'd rather find out at what point do we get to 100% drop rate then have me hopes up every week that it might drop, it would save me the disappointment.

What will probably be more disappointing is that if they find that the bad luck protection hasn't been working and they fix it, it will no doubt ignore all previous completions and we'll need to build up the drop chances again.",1615947639,2021-03-16 22:20:39

DestinyTheGame,Raid Exotic Ranking list,"I am just going to start off by saying that this is just my opinion, and that you are fine to disagree with me. These may be subject to change with future buffs and nerfs, so feel free to let me know if I should change anything. 

Number 6: Tarrabah. I think this gun has huge potential if it receives any changes (which is probably unlikely at this point). While I find it fun to use and it can do some damage in certain scenarios, there are just far better exotics for practical use.

Number 5: Legend of Acrius. This gun is very good in close quarters scenarios when you need big damage, especially with the catalyst, but there are not that many scenarios that can utilize it. There are much better weapons that can fill the heavy exotic slot.

Number 4: Eyes of Tomorrow. This rocket launcher gets out dps'd by some legendary rocket launchers, and that Is not a good thing. It can clear out rooms of ads and majors great, but why would you waste your heavy for that? With the damage reduction against bosses and many other enemies, I put this at number 4. To be fair, though, it is an amazing invade weapon in gambit. 

Number 3: One Thousand Voices. This was going to be Eyes of Tomorrow, but with all the damage nerfs and bugs going around it, I decided to put 1k at number 3. It is fun as hell, does a lot of damage, and has dps comparable to xenophage. It is an S tier weapon, and it is very fun to use.

Number 2: Divinity. This weapon will most likely always be utilized in endgame content as long as somebody has it. This weapon is almost essential to one phase taniks with slug shotguns, and it can be used in many other situations as well (I love helping blueberries do more damage in strikes). This weapon will most likely always be relevant in endgame content, hence my high ranking.

Number 1: Anarchy. I bet you could all see this coming a mile away. It is probably the most versatile weapon in the entire game. Great boss damage, ad clearing, champion killing, and many other things. If you don't have this weapon, this should be one of, if not your top priority to get. Being able to deal damage from behind cover is huge in endgame content, and being able to switch to your special for higher dps is just icing on the cake. 

Thanks for reading everyone.

DestinyTheGame,Bungie should support content creators through ornament collaborations.,"I think that Destiny content creators are extremely popular among our community yet underrated by Bungie. I feel that I discuss content creators or their videos in almost every single LFG group I‚Äôve been a part of. This doesn‚Äôt happen in other games, yet other major titles support their creators through collaborations or codes in the item shop.

It would be so cool to see ornament collaborations between Bungie and their content creators. Even if its not a full armor set, supporting Bungie through purchasing a Gernader Jake‚Äôs last word l or an IFrostBolt titan mark would be a win-win for every party involved.

DestinyTheGame,Nice reminder as to why I never solo queue quickplay,"I am one this subreddits most hated type of player. A pvp sweat who only ever stacks. However today I needed just a bit more cabal gold to get the last hammer charge and since it was just one game, it wasn't worth LFGing and none of my friends were on so I thought I'd just quickly solo queue a single game. This is my first time solo queuing quickplay in ages. Holy fuck I'd completely forgotten how garbage my teammates could be. The enemy team weren't even that good, I was slaying out the entire game, dropped a 7.83 efficiency and 47 opponents defeated (big flex am good). Not a single person on my team went positive or got over 12 defeats against a below average team.  We lost lmao. Will never ever solo queue again. Will only ever stack again from now on.

DestinyTheGame,BeerThought: How the final mission of the Light And Darkness Saga should go.,"Picture this:
The Darkness has finally made it to Earth. Where the Traveler sits, the lead Pyramid hovering not far. Scale ship and Guardian jumpships flying through the skies, the surrounding orbit of Earth, every planet we have left. Aerial combat the likes of which humanity has never seen before. Meanwhile ground troops fight in a seemingly endless firefight to gain a single step forward on both sides. 

Now we come to you, Guardian, in the midst of the most hardcore ship-to-ship combat experience in your time as a Guardian. Flying through gravitational anomalies while outrunning a swarm of Pyramid Scale ships. Suddenly Ghost cries out that you've lost one of your thrusters and you are now spinning out of control. In an act of reckless desperation, you punch the warp drive activation. 

The next thing you know, you're crashing into solid ground. The gamble worked. You climb out of your ship and look around, and a nauseating wave of nostalgia washes over you as you see rusted cars, a broken highway bridge, and a massive wall. The Cosmodrome. You laugh and check your weapons. Heavy ammo is low, your preferred special is still working, but your Primary weapon is in pieces. Ghost says he's unable to connect to your Vault to get you another optimal weapon. You're already running through the Breach, shooting any Hive or Darkness you come across. Suddenly, your eye catches something. You recognize a symbol used by Hunters to identify a cache they stored away for anyone who finds it. You rush over and rip the cache open. And there it is, you're oldest and fondest friend. Who was there for you at the very Beginning, and now is there for you at the End. Khvostov. Sight is cracked, plenty of ammo, and feels just right in your hands.

On top of that, I'm still missing mods that I had in Year 2. The only method to get mods is random chance, either from Gunsmith packages or whatever Banshee sells. This system is doesn't work.

Why not allow us to buy whatever mods we want whenever we want, in the same style as the Monument? Maybe increase the price of the Elemental Well/Charged with Light/Warmind Cell mods, I don't care. Make them accessible and acquirable.

DestinyTheGame,"Although it‚Äôs a bandaid fix and there are also other aspects of Trials that need to be fixed, adding post-match rewards would help alleviate a lot of tensions that Trials currently faces regarding playerbase.","There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for a casual players (or even anyone below the top 5% for that matter) to go into Trials right now because they‚Äôre only going to be getting a few drops a week. Therefore, less casuals play Trials, making it harder for casuals that do want Trials‚Äô loot from getting it. Massive downward spiral in overall playerbase. 

Literally the addition of random postgame rewards, maybe that even increase as you go up the card, would give casuals a reason to play Trials because they are being *rewarded for their time*.  More casuals, the easier it is for casuals to get loot, causing even more casuals to play Trials. Massive upward spiral in overall playerbase. 

I feel like it‚Äôs been such a no brainer locked behind the sentiment of ‚ÄúTrials loot is for good players‚Äù and the ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù mindset associated with Trials, but quite frankly it‚Äôs awful that time and resources are going to be allotted to a gamemode that so few play. If there‚Äôs an actual playerbase associated with trials, then it would justify development time to be spent on it (ie: general improvements, new loot, etc). There‚Äôs so much that Trials needs help with right now, and the addition of postgame rewards is probably the best way to start imo.",1615945708,2021-03-16 21:48:28

No hipfire penalty.
Allowing faster strafing.
Literally 70m+ range.
Deals 84 damage meaning much more flinch and allows 2H1B thats okay??

The first one is busted but the second one is okay?
Im not saying nerf it to the ground, but making it a 140rpm OR decreasing its damage to require 3 Headshots.

DestinyTheGame,Infinite Depths - An idea for a Hive procedurally generated cavern system.,"*Who knows how many maze like tunnels and caverns exist below the moon. The Hive have burrowed deep below its surface for years and there are probably a near infinite amount of dark, winding passages connecting to larger caverns. Shouldn't Guardians begin to explore these depths?*

This idea takes inspiration from the Underground DLC from the Division which created procedurally generated levels in the subway system of New York. The Hive set the perfect premise for such an activity and would allow for procedurally generated tunnels &amp; cavern systems to be linked together randomly. Destiny does underground settings very well and with enough tile sets in the mix this could feel near endless. Being the Hive it could even have some suspenseful elements like low light areas utilizing our headlamps paired with spooky ambient sounds to create a more intense experience similar to the recent Presage mission (Loved that one!) 

The activity could have custom settings at the start to allow for setting the length &amp; difficulty and perhaps some modifiers to increase the challenge (and chance for loot to drop). It would be a great way to work on bounties, or completing catalysts and feel less repetitive.",1615945020,2021-03-16 21:37:00

DestinyTheGame,"Tips for Devil's Lair Nightfall strike, all Champion locations for Hero and Legend difficulty, video with timestamps and descriptions","Hello all.  Posting another video of Champion spawns with timestamps for the Hero and/or Legend Nightfalls, plus some tips that I hope will help.

Video link: https://youtu.be/s6cZNBcH8Qw

If I've missed stamping anything please let me know!  
&amp;nbsp;


**Other Tips:**

- **Shields are Arc, Solar, AND Void:** Unfortunately, all shield elements are present in this weeks Nightfall, and they all show up in significant enough numbers or places to be a hassle to deal with when Match Game is active.  A sword might help for Captains' Arc shields, but is Risky against Wizards' Solar and will NOT be able to reach Servitors' Void without a lot of dangerous jumping around in the middle of a boss fight.  Speaking of swords...

- **Swords are mixed in terms of usability:**  It's a tough call on whether swords are the best heavy choice this week.  There are several extremely add-heavy encounters, and at least one is in extremely close quarters, so swords are a great help there.  They can be extremely helpful in killing the two giant Brigs during teh Spider Tank fight, and are also a great fallback option during the boss fight to kill Captains or other adds who move in at you a bit aggressively.  Unfortunately, they're practically entirely unusable against this weeks boss and his shielding Servitors, and are also probably dangerous to attempt to use against the Spider Tank.  If you're solo and feel like you can DPS the strike boss and Spider Tank without them then I'd definitely bring one, but if you aren't sure then opt for something with more range.

- **This week's boss is extremely weak to Machine Guns:**  For some reason, this week's boss doesn't seem to register as being an actual strike boss.  As such, machine guns don't get their normal penalty to damage against bosses, and are capable of dealing great damage.  This is especially useful considering how far away the boss can be at times, as well as the amount of teleporting that he does which might cause you to miss shots with something like a rocket or GL.  Machine guns can also fill the same add clearing/""make my problems go away"" role that swords tend to fill, which is nice considering that this week's boss can't really be hit with swords.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think that's it for now, but if anybody else has anything really important to add I'll also add that to the main post.  Hope this helps!",1615941315,2021-03-16 20:35:15
DestinyTheGame,Osmosis Spec mod idea,"this is just an random idea i had for an Osmosis specific mod

[light.gg, osmosis perk](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1774574192/osmosis/)

Name : Osmosis Spec

Description : Kills whist osmosis is active increases grenade recharge

what it does

* after proc'ing osmosis, any kills by the weapon will grant an increase to discipline
   * duration per kill is based on rank
      * red bar                           = 3sec
      * major/champions        = 4sec
      * bosses and guardians = 5sec
   * max duration is capped at 10 sec
   * buff goes away as SOON as the weapon is stowed regardless of remaining time
      * this is just like the perk you lose the element as soon as it is stowed
   * buff to discipline is ;
      * buffedStat = stat + ((100 - stat) \* 0.5)
      * this is rounded up

with this stasis would need to be added to the osmosis list, which would also allow for stasis to use elemental wells more/better

EDIT : after doing the maths below i feel 50% is to high thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

^(just to show off the maths)

^(10 discipline)

^(= 10 + ((100 - 10) \* 0.5))

^(= 10 + 90 \* 0.5)

^(= 10 + 45)

^(= 55 (rounded up))

^(\~= 60)

^(87 discipline) 

^(= 87 + ((100 - 87) \* 0.5))

^(= 87 + (13 \* 0.5))

^(= 87 + 6.5)

^(= 87 + 7 (rounded up))

^(= 94)

^(\~= 100 (rounded up))",1615941208,2021-03-16 20:33:28

Rather than having something like the dark decoder to decrypt engram into specific loot drops, why can't we have an artifact or mod that increases our drop changes of a particular weapon or armor piece in any given playlist?

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, please don't go too far separating sandboxes.","I know that most of us have been wanting certain guns and abilities to retain their potency in PvE while not being overpowered in PvP, and I consider myself to be in that crowd. 

However, what appeals to me the most about this game is that I can rely on everything that I have equipped functioning exactly the same in both PvE and PvP.  I know that in the heat of the moment, no matter what activity I'm in, I don't have to think about what activity I'm in and what that means for an ability I'm going to use. 

With the latest round of Stasis adjustments Bungie has done something they've never done before, and that is changing the core function of how an ability performs depending on the activity. Casting Glacial Quake in PvP no longer freezes enemies around you in PvP, but it will in PvE. The Hunter Withering Blade shurikens won't apply enough slow stacks to freeze on double impact or combined with the dodge while in PvP, but they will in PvE. 

Changes like the above are great for players that main PvP and barely touch the rest of the game and vice versa. As for players like myself that enjoy them equally, I don't want to see too many of these core functionality changes.",1615937674,2021-03-16 19:34:34

DestinyTheGame,"""We don't want people to do the same seal every season, so here's gilded"" - you made gilded conqueror the same as base conqueror the past 3 seasons","So the requirements for gilded conqueror are to all 6 GMs this season. In a TWAB when Gilded was announced this was a quote from it:

""We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!"" 

Yet Gilded is the exact same as base conqueror has been the past few seasons? This was pretty disappointing to find out after finishing the new base conqueror today as I thought we'd get fun challenges to do and be able to finally unlock gilded this week.

Kinda sucks how it's the exact same thing again and we can't get gilded for another 5 weeks so we hardly get to enjoy the golden title.

Will this be changed in future seasons so we get to have gilded for more than a few weeks at the end of  the season and get more interesting challenges to tackle? The all subclass one would have been a good one for gilded conqueror imo.",1615936710,2021-03-16 19:18:30
DestinyTheGame,Guided Games could make use of the 12-man raid bug/feature: 6 pre-matched players guiding 6 randoms.,"After seeing another post by a user with similar neurodiversity conditions to me, it sparked an idea on how to revamp the currently, mostly obsolete 'Guided Games' feature. Right now, Guided Games are not really used for a plethora of reasons - from there not really being much reward to doing them to the fact that it's still capped at 6 players, and as most raids require significant coordination, it's hard to help coordinate with randoms who are likely still learning the raid to get objectives complete.  

I think the 12-man Raid bug/feature is ideal for Guided Games. You could allow a group of 6 players with a specified amount of clears in the raid to be the 'guides', which would then match them with 6 randoms or smaller groups (like fireteams of 2-3), who they would guide through the raid. This would help users who aren't as comfortable with LFG, don't have the friends to play the game, or simply conditions which make interacting on this level difficult.  

I understand that there would have to be some incentive for players to actually *be* guides, as well as good reasoning for experienced players to just not jump into GG instead of going on LFG and finding a group. So, here are a few things I thought could incentivize guides and discourage players who can do the raid 'normally' from abusing the GG System:  
**Encouragement for Guides:**  
* Add some kind of drop rate for Upgrade Materials when guiding guardians, chance increases per additional Guardian in the 'guided' group - Upgrade Modules, Cores, Prisms &amp; even Shards for the final boss would be a great incentive for groups of 6 to drop into guide mode instead of just running a raid regularly.  
* Additional XP, emblems, ornaments, &amp; non-powerful loot to encourage people looking for specific rolls to do so with guided games.  

**Discouragement for people abusing system:**  
* Limit loot from GG to 1 time per account per week per activity. This would at least prevent repeated farming on alt characters. While it would have some impact on genuine GG users, it's a necessary feature to prevent people abusing it imho.  
* Prevent from re-queueing into an activity as a guided player if you already have gotten your loot from, or completed a successful run of that activity that week.   

Additionally, the use of the report system and the 'guardian oath' are a good way of keeping the system overall 'clean' of abusive users on either side.  

I think this, along with some kind of ping system to help non-chat communication, would honestly work perfectly to make Guided Games what it should've been.",1615936657,2021-03-16 19:17:37

Despite the inordinate amount of time we spent after BL dropped, we just weren't allowed to get the collectibles, something we actually had a desire to do, for no real reason. It's disheartening, and the way you're doing it on the Glykkon is even worse.

I thought when a season ends, the exotic quests are available for all the people that didn't buy season of the hunt pass, but no when i did the moon quest with osiris, got to talk to spider no quest was popping. I started to think , maybe i need to research a little more.  
Went to the old quest kiosk, nothing  
Got the osiris message you receive after the quest and returned to spider, nothing  
Then i see some posts saying that you have to purchase a lure from crow and do a wrathborn hunt, i say cool and i proceed to get this lure from crow.

  
When i get there says ""Season of the Hunt pass required"" and prompts me to go buy beyond light deluxe edition to get it. so instead of saying well dude give me 1000 silver ( 334$ARS ) and i let you get the weapon. 

Instead i have to pay 1949$ARS to get the only thing i wanted from beyond light because the only way to get the season of the hunt pass is to get the deluxe edition.

DestinyTheGame,Returning player after 2+ years who watched a video prior asking still got questions,"Hi. As mentioned in the title I'm a returning player, who played right before Forsaken was released.

I watched this video which was pretty good in explanations ( [https://youtu.be/Q\_1TLH\_ZyuQ](https://youtu.be/Q_1TLH_ZyuQ) ) but I still have some questions. I also want to add that I don't have any expansion. 

\- Firstly, is there any story-based quests for returning player to get to the soft cap (is it still 1200?) ? Or any other way that isn't just going left and right killing enemies on a map.

\- From the video it seems that D.I.M is a must have, should I get into it right now?

\- My first character is stuffed exo + purple but of course it is only 1100. I read that exo are still viable but should I throw away the rest of my gear when I drop something new? (except if I want to keep it for transmog)

\- About sunset gear, I read that since it couldn't be infused anymore it was safe to delete all of it but better be safe than sorry so I'm still asking about it here

I'm just wondering... How does one rank up these days? I've been cranking out Vanguard Strikes and Crucible, but I see we can still increase the rep that way? I have 200 exotics in my vault, but do I keep them? I see I can upgrade them but there's a cap now? I stayed subbed here because I had hoped they made the game less of a grind for us casuals, and saw they sunsetted sunsetting... But can anyone ELI5 the armor/masterwork? I was buying engrams from rahool thinking I was decrypting engrams and now Im just so confused. **Jackie Chan Face** help a new first time dad try to get lost in the Destiny world again pleaseeee.

DestinyTheGame,Dead Man's Tale catalyst quest not showing up on other characters?,"I completed Presage for the first time on my Hunter a few weeks back, then when Master dropped, Zavala gave me the catalyst quest.  Rad.

However, since then, I've been playing more on my Warlock.  I ran regular presage with some friends, got my pinnacle reward and a new roll on DMT, just like you normally would.  What I didn't notice at the time was that I didn't get the catalyst quest on my Warlock.  Then two days ago, I finally got around to running Master Presage.  We completed it with some difficulty, I was excited to get the catalyst to pop, and then... nothing.  I checked my quest inventory and realized I didn't have the quest.  Okay, pretty annoyed that I wasted time suffering through Master only to get nothing out of it, but that's on me for not checking beforehand.  Went back to the tower to talk to Zavala and... he didn't have the quest.  Weird.  Then I realized that I never did the Forsaken campaign on my Warlock, so that map was locked behind the opening mission.  Maybe that's why.  I run the first mission of Forsaken (first few missions actually, just to be sure), the map is open and I can now select Presage from the director.  Zavala still doesn't have the quest for me.  Finally, I run Presage solo.  This should definitely do it.  Nope, still no quest from Zavala.

This has to be a bug, right?  Normally, exotic catalyst quests show up at the vendor as ""abandoned quests"" on your other characters and share progress.  I've been able to pick up where I left off on multiple catalysts after switching characters.  I realize that I can just do Master on my hunter (which is honestly probably for the best since the warlock jump is a fucking nightmare in that mission), but it's annoying that this caused me to miss out on the catalyst from my first Master clear.  Also annoying that Bungie still stubbornly forces you to complete the campaigns on all three characters in order to open up destinations on your alts.  If this is indeed a bug, I'm almost certain that that was the culprit.",1615929881,2021-03-16 17:24:41

DestinyTheGame,"If you're trying to get Xenophage, be aware that the Lost Sector puzzles are currently bugged.","I googled this issue and saw other posts about it, but posters in those threads have chalked it up to explosive or unstoppable rounds.  This is not the issue (it might be a separate issue).  The puzzles are bugged (step 2 of The Journey quest).

When I tried doing these puzzles with my fireteam, shooting the first button changed the symbols, but the second button did nothing.  We kept trying the second button for a while, and eventually it changed (after like 3-4 minutes of waiting).  Same for the third and fourth buttons.  We tried this in K1 Logistics and K1 Communion, same issue in both.  When we finally got the fourth button to change and all the symbols matched up, the chest did not spawn. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/qfm2d5D) We waited for like 10 minutes and the chest never spawned.

We tried leaving and retrying the lost sectors, we tried going to orbit and reloading the instance, we tried splitting up and trying solo, the issue still occurred.  We tried using a scout rifle, a sidearm, and even a shotgun.  It wasn't until my friend tried solo using an SMG that it worked.  Then I tried it with a pulse rifle and it worked.  Auto rifles were not tested, but it definitely seems to be an issue with single-shot weapons (though my scout rifle was the full-auto raid scout).  I don't know whether this is a new issue or an old one that never got fixed.  I had done this step of the quest on my Hunter a while back and had no issues, but I don't remember what weapon I was using at the time.

TL;DR - This part of the quest is bugged with multiple weapon types.  The symbols will glitch and fail to change if you're using the wrong weapon type.  The only weapon types I know to work are SMGs and Pulse Rifles.  So SGA: do this step of the quest with a pulse rifle or SMG equipped.",1615927615,2021-03-16 16:46:55

DestinyTheGame,"Guided Games 2.0 could simply be 6 raiders plus 1-2 ""ride alongs""","The biggest issue with current Guided Games is that a group of 4 people are matched with 2 people who may or may not know the raid, and may or may not even communicate. Raids generally require active participation from all 6 players, and this is where guided games falls apart pretty quickly and why almost nobody uses the feature.

What is the goal of guided games? My understanding is: 1) to introduce raids to players who have never raided before, and 2) familiarize and teach a raid and it's mechanics to novices.

I am willing to bet that the 12 player raids we have seen over the past few weeks have introduced and familiarized more players to raids than guided games ever has.

# What if, instead of guided games being 4 guides and 2 seekers, it was 6 guides and 2 seekers? 

That way, it's less of a big deal if the seekers aren't fully capable or even cooperative. If raid mechanics only require 6 players, they can dip their toes, take a role is they want to, or just clear adds. Regardless, they get to see the raid and have some degree of first hand experience.

A negative thing I could see happening often is that the seekers just make no attempt to engage with the raid mechanics. Maybe they just kill adds and do some DPS. That's still an upside for a team of 6 raiders who were going to do it anyway.

Also what stops the seeker from triggering wipe mechanics? Nothing, but if a seeker goes full griefer mode then they won't get very far before the guides just leave and do it without them. It's still no worse than 4+2 guided games.

Also if we are concerned about seekers getting easy raid rewards, maybe seekers just get weaker rewards than guides? Such as powerful drops instead of pinnacles. Perhaps the guides recieve bonus Spoils of Conquest?

I previously thought that Guided Games was never going to be able to succeed, but I had never considered extra players as a possibility. After seeing the positive impact that 12 man raids has had on brining ""raid virgins"" into raids, it's pretty clear that this is the best solution to Guided Game's problems.

The solution doesn't have to be perfect, by the way. I'm pretty sure hardcore raiders would not have the patience to add a couple extra ""variables"" to their runs. But I can see a lot of weekend warrior type raiding clans willing to rope in a couple randoms in exchange for some extra rewards. And I can see a LOT of raid newbies using a feature like this to test the waters and eventually be able to say they KWTD.",1615926434,2021-03-16 16:27:14

DestinyTheGame,What destiny means to me. by ALI ZIN for SOTR (sorry about the grammar) i‚Äôm only 15.,"I‚Äôve played destiny 1 since it came out on xbox. at the time. I was about eight years old. I played with my parents, my father a hunter, my mother a warlock, and me a crayon eating titan. For my 12th birthday, my parents some how got me a solo tour into bungie, and it made me fall in love with the game even more, they were play testing destiny 2 at the time. They showed me the inner workings of bungie, I met cozmo, got a a motherboard of the original halo 2 game (I don‚Äôt know how that works). Then I did VOG, it was my only raid completion ever on d1. Sadly, that was the end of my time with d1, I later moved on to d2 and it‚Äôs beta. Of course, i was a titan and I loved it. As a fire team (my mom, dad, grandpa, a summer camp counselor, my friend, and I.) We tried to do the leviathan, of course, we failed, at the time, i was young and quite bad at the game. I was able to convince my summer camp counselor and my parents to do a lfg thru destiny. We loaded in, all four of us, with two other dudes who lived across the country in pittsburg. Little did I know they would end up being some of my best friends. We finished the raid, slaying calus and screaming. once the dust and bullet shells settled, my father, finally made a clan called the Shards Of the Traveler. He invited everyone we knew that played, (at the time it was only my grandpa, friends, the dudes we met, and my counselor.) It slowly grew as my  family (fire team fambam) grew closer to the dudes we met and my counselor (fireteam bully). We began to complete raids like it was a thing that noobs do so easily, one in a hour. (which now i know isn‚Äôt crazy good). My dad started to get good at crucible, so like father like son, i followed. We got the revoker, recluse, lunas and nf. I played with the same people for three- four years. Almost every day(no i‚Äôm not a fat slob, I play a lot of soccer so i‚Äôm fit). I grew to know these boys well, and i grew up around them. Over the last year, we were introduced to a new clan mate, a friend of theirs from college, she and my mother immediately connected, both of them being decently bad ( I love you mom). We would play every night from 6 until 9-10pm, we killed gods, guardians, and stasis wielding jerks on europa. I became a hunter, and became really sweaty. I‚Äôm now known as the ‚Äúsuper sweaty kid‚Äù by all of my classmates that play destiny. I‚Äôve grown to be in love with the game, sure stasis sucks, but we can all agree, this game has a vision that if given a chance, can be a truly amazing game. Whether it‚Äôs in killing hive gods, becoming flawless in trials, or just doing 12 man nightfalls with clan mates. 

To round this little story up. This game, in a odd way, raised me, from a crayon eating fist slamming titan, to a hunter who at times is reported for using aimbot. (I don‚Äôt use it). This is for destiny, my family/my clan; cap, drop pod, skele, ellie, hahn, and zed. I love you all, and for everyone who as sticked with this odd game thru the rough times.

And it did more than just provide fun times, it opened up access to tougher events (Raids specifically I feel) to people that could just never enjoy that.  

My sister in law is casual at best and just not very skilled.  She cannot raid and struggles with tough content.  However I took her through a 9 guardian garden of salvation and she absolutely loved it.

What I would like to propose Bungie do is make this an event.  Just like triple infamy, or double valor.  12  guardian Fireteam weekend.

I'm not familiar enough with their stories either to determine any intended purpose of them.

Any ideas?! I think it'd be good to have one for hoard mode (lots of small enemies around), another for big boss mode (lots of big enemies around, or for a big tough one), and another for... I'm not sure... generating class ability?!

Honestly, thats dog shit. For first time conquerors, sure, gotta do em all. For those of us that have been doing them for seasons on end? Should be a few additional challenges, and you should be able to get them as soon as the rest. 

On a side note, would be great to not save the only decently challenging content until a month after launch too. if people arent leveled, there not gonna go into GM's, but some of us do want to go in them earlier, or even under light for a challenge, let us do that if we want.

If you masterworked any of them, I recommend not swapping them around so that the materials you spent masterworking aren't essentially thrown away.

DestinyTheGame,I have a theory about the Proving Grounds Strike coming in a week.,"Spoiler cuz of the new lore, and in case I am right (probably unlikely)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so in the new Lore book, it goes over Zavala's decision to challenge to Cabal to a Rite of Proving to put a conclusion to the Battlegrounds. Caiatl says ""We'll put forth Ignovun as our champion... inside the Halphas Electus. We'll see how much Light the smallmen have once they fight their way inside.""

Two things here, I'm pretty sure the Halphas Electus is the big-ass tank on Nessus, but that's literally only because I don't even know what else it could be. We're fighting our way inside eventually, so it makes sense to me. Second, is this; ""**We'll see how much Light the smallmen have** once they fight their way inside.""

&amp;#x200B;

You know how the Cabal have developed Light disrupting tech? What if they took that and put it into a much larger, Cabal scale? Like an intentional trap to secure victory by taking away our Light for the Rite of Proving? What if the boss fight of the Proving Grounds Strike doesn't allow us to use our abilities, at all? Like the Red War?

&amp;#x200B;

After looking over the Season of the Chosen trailer, I never saw an ability used inside the tank at all. This could easily be a coincidence, but I think it's possible that Proving Grounds will strip our light from us once more, making it a little more ""equal"" fight. Of course, this is all speculation, but I don't really see why this couldn't happen. Plus it would make the strike really unique and much more of a challenge, something that is to determine the fate of the Cabal Empire should probably be.",1615924675,2021-03-16 15:57:55

Anyway here's my idea with scaling rewards with fireteams.


 If you're in a fireteam of 3/6 you can unlock all triumphs and pinnacles and loot drops fully masterworked (maybe 7/8 for armour) for your first run maybe a huge chunk of glimmer and upgrade materials. Exotics/cosmetics will also only drop in a fireteam of 3. High chance of high roll amour (80%).

However if you have 3+/6+ you only get base power weapon and armour. No materials no spoils, heck no access to rerolling thing. Low chance of high stat amour (20%)

Contest mode is only for the correct sizes.

I think this strikes the right balance of loot/fun/team sizes.",1615924133,2021-03-16 15:48:53

And I go great i'll use this it looks fun as fuck. But I get deeper into the video and I am missing some of the mods. Specifically Radiant Light and Swift Charge. Ever since I saw that video I go to banshee everyday at reset and pray that he atleast will bring one of them especially swift charge since I love using sidearms,submachine gun, and pulses. the thing that gives me the greatest amount of despair was just the fact that I missed it. It's not a raid gun or something that comes with random rolls so I can't complain about bad rng it was an accessable mod from the gunsmith. There is no quest no nothing all I had to do was just give him 10 mod components. I was originally one of those people who didn't get warmind cells or CWL mods so I just ignored them.

But I've inspected the ones who have destroyed them and they have no mods equipped, meaning the cells will not do anything. And it's infuriating. 

Idk maybe there should be a change to them where you can't interact with them without a war mind cell mod on. I've just been really excited to finally try out this build, and I haven't been able to interact with the cells before a fellow random decides to destroy it.

DestinyTheGame,"It's been fun, but I'm out after how the past few months have played out.","Done with and uninstalled Destiny 2. They banned our clan leader right before Christmas with no explanation and zero response from customer support, our clan pretty much all stopped playing out of solidarity with him. Since then we've tried for several months to get any sort of response from Bungie with nothing coming back, and the community as a whole has been *completely unhelpful and incredibly rude*.

For something I spent over a thousand hours and several hundred dollars on, I can't help but feel like I wasted my time giving this game a try, and very much so wasted my time custom-building my new gaming rig themed around WarMind; at least the latter is something I can easily change.

It's funny to think that just a few months ago I posted how much I was enjoying the game and its community, and how quickly that enthusiasm soured with the immediate ostracizing our group received.

I already know the majority of the kind of responses I'm going to get to this, so keep it to yourself if you're going to comment with some QQ crap. Maybe some of you will prove me wrong.

All we wanted was an answer to 'why?' and an opportunity to prove it was a wrongful ban, and everyone from forum users to community managers has come back with nothing but negativity and utter childishness, along with complete silence on Bungie's part. I worked for many years on MMO's as a dev, and I would be sorely disappointed in the team I worked with if they'd handled things this poorly.

And to the mods, seriously, screw you guys if you delete this post like you did the last time I posted about this when I was asking for assistance. I'm beyond asking for help at this point as everyone has shown they don't give a fuck.",1615921594,2021-03-16 15:06:34

DestinyTheGame,Could a Dev explain why Crimson was created instead of adding Red Death back into the game?,"I‚Äôm genuinely curious. Bungie does have a thing for exotic hand cannons‚Äîthere are more exotic hand cannons than any other primary weapon type, by far (there is even Eriana‚Äôs Vow, a special ammo exotic hand cannon!).

The only reason I can think of is that they wanted to reuse some of the same ideas, but wanted to differentiate D2 from D1 during the early days. Chain lightning and lifesteal are both very common abilities found in many different video games.

Zhalo Supercell becoming Riskrunner makes a lot of sense to me. They promote sub machine guns, a new archetype, by creating a new exotic sub machine gun that echoes an old favorite with a new twist. Everyone also loves chain lightning.

But for Crimson...I just don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs basically a living meme considering Bungie‚Äôs over emphasis on exotic hand cannons.

Crimson is unique in the sense that it was the first ever burst handcannon (later we got the DOA Warden‚Äôs Law in Forsaken), but it just seems super gimmicky since it literally is just a 3 round burst that also heals the user.  The catalyst also just boosts the range...not too exciting. At least Riskrunner offers some unique perks.

Riskrunner feels like a spiritual successor to Zhalo while Crimson just feels like a gimmicky ripoff (no offense to Crimson fans).

It‚Äôs not like Red Death was broken or wasn‚Äôt iconic enough. It was a fan favorite, and even was able to hang somewhat before the peak of hand cannons dominance in D1.

Since Red Death was a pulse rifle that LOOKED LIKE an Auto Rifle...maybe the devs wanted to make Crimson a pulse that looked like an exotic handcannon? The problem is Crimson isn‚Äôt a pulse, it‚Äôs a handcannon, and the bullets damage are calculated oddly.

Again...I‚Äôm not bashing Crimson outright. But I am immensely curious as to its origins. Red Death was a PVP favorite in D1, and it also was incredible useful in Crota‚Äôs End to bypass Crota‚Äôs antihealing. Red Death also just looks super bad ass, has a really cool name, and had a reputation as ‚Äúthe banned Vanguard weapon‚Äù. We even got Crimson Spectre legendary auto rifles exclusive to Crucible, which was was really cool since Red Death originates from a modified auto rifle frame.

TL;DR I doubt it will happen, but it would be really cool for Bungie to explain why Crimson was created as opposed to bringing back Red Death. Since Crimson exists, I don‚Äôt think Red Death ever will come back, which imho, is a damn shame.",1615921410,2021-03-16 15:03:30

DestinyTheGame,Removing parts of Forsaken to make it ‚Äúless confusing‚Äù for new players actually makes the game more confusing and shallow for new players.,"I know this definitely won‚Äôt change Bungie‚Äôs decision but I seriously can‚Äôt understand how removing content would make things less confusing for new players.

I remember when I came back during Season of Arrivals I was very confused about a lot of things story wise (and gameplay wise tbh), I was even more confused after I played through Forsaken and was told that Uldren Sov will be coming back in Beyond Light. Turns out it‚Äôs because I missed 1 cutscene from one of the previous seasons that showed him getting resurrected. 

One of my friends got into D2 and I basically had to explain to him everything whenever we played since he wasn‚Äôt able to finish the Red War campaign to top it all off he was showing some interest in buying Forsaken. I have another friend who is willing to give D2 a try but she‚Äôs dependent on the story, well that‚Äôs great because uh...there‚Äôs no story for her that helps establish this game.

If you want to talk about confusing you have the Presage quest. In order to start it you have to go to the Arms Dealer strike, which is narrated by Cayde, to pick up something and then in the quest you could possibly head Cayde‚Äôs voice who is ...supposed to be dead. Doesn‚Äôt this contradict the current story? (No please don‚Äôt take out the strike)

Without the Red War Campaign and Leviathan raids season of the Chosen can be confusing as well and I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with letting players advance the story at their own pace?

tl;dr: removing content just makes the game more confusing to new players just put a quick recap for major events?",1615921308,2021-03-16 15:01:48

DestinyTheGame,"Did you know that simply hits, not kills, with a Lasting Impression rocket will trigger Ambitious Assassin? (Rocket Launchers)","I acquired a Heretic, Aggressive Frame, rocket launcher. With it came Ambitious Assassin and Lasting Impression. After running some tests I determined that the triggers for an Ambitious Assassin reload is either multiple kills with the rocket, or hitting a single target with a Lasting Impression rocket. The Trait description does not mention this. Bear in mind, that having two 2 rockets in a magazine does not change this fact. Still, only one of these two rockets needs to hit an enemy before reloading to trigger Ambitious assassin.

While this may not be a game changer for ad clearing, given the difficulty of direct hits on smaller targets, this does provide the opportunity to unload 7+ rockets in a matter of seconds, which makes for huge burst damage potential.

My first and obvious choice is to use Sealed Ahamkara's Grasp, but there are many other exotic combos I'm sure. Ranged melees still trigger this reload, so Stasis SC with dodge to reload melee can work very well. 

You can hit a target, use first melee, fire off 2 more rockets, dodge to reload a single melee back, use melee again, fire off 2 more rockets, use final melee, fire off 2 rockets.

If you're feeling really bold, you can start off the combo sequence with an uncharged melee. The delay on Lasting Impression should allow you enough time to get to a safe distance before the first rocket explodes. If performed successfully, this sequence will fire off a total of 9 rockets, which is the exact number of reserves on a Heretic rocket launcher with 2 rocket launcher scavenger perks on.

Best of luck to anyone farming the rocket launcher from Altars of Sorrow",1615920257,2021-03-16 14:44:17

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, the Dreadnaught in The Witch Queen is a must have!","I think the Dreadnaught would be a amazing side location in The Witch Queen DLC, the [Road to Witch Queen](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50124) revealed they are delaying the release to early 2022 instead of late 2021 to give them enough time to work. 

The Dreadnaught has all this going for it

1.  fan-favorite location with gobs and gobs of hidden collectibles and challenges New Light and Veteran players alike probably haven't gone through yet. 
2. Rich lore on the Hive and the 3 Sisters (Oryx, Xivu-Arath, Savathun) which is relevant to the expansion as well as being interesting and slightly horror themed which the community has shown they like recently with Presage. 
3. Has strikes which with a few new voice lines could be perfect as they are already great and have strike specific rewards which again the community likes. (Much like S.A.B.E.R in the Cosmodrome)
4. &gt;! Connection to the Cabal (Calus/Ghaul) in the crashed ship!&lt; which is a huge factor of D2 with Cabal being relevant from 2017-2021 with the Red legion, the Leviathan, the Glykon, Caiatl  and more. &gt;!as well as being a perfect way to continue the Hive/Cabal line that has just begun with Xivu Araths destruction of Torbatl !&lt;
5. Chance to get the New Light guardians up to speed with the Taken/Hive going into the campaign
6. Repeatable activities, patrols, public events, transmat zones, lost sectors, and more
7. Tons of potential armor, sparrows, ghost shells, shaders, weapons, exotics, quests.
8. One of the if not THE best Raid in Destiny history that can be brought back much like VoG
9. Fits into the lore, The ship is just sitting in orbit right now. No changes or events that need to be explaine, its just...there
10. Way to satisfy the (Oryx is coming back?!?!?) and (Oryx in D2?!?!?!) and (Oryx's worm on Titan?!?!) conspiracy theorists

And Best of all, Its already done. With new graphics and voice lines as well as tweaks here and there the dreadnaught is a treasure trove of Lore, Loot, and potential just sitting there. The Cosmodrome proved these ""renovations"" can be done, Its a fast easy way to bring a amazing chunk of D1's history to the presence as well as a way to save time and effort on production instead of building a whole new planet/place from scrap.

I just thought of this when I saw the Dreadnaught in saturns rings while watching a old video about Titan, What do you guys think about this? Anything you would like to see return/left out? Might be a silly idea that is unrealistic but the taken king was my favorite DLC to date and I really want to see it return someday in some form.",1615919324,2021-03-16 14:28:44

DestinyTheGame,Nerfing/Fixing Omnioculus was a Mistake,"Fixing Omnioculus was a mistake.  The exotic does 3 things:

* Grants 2 smoke bombs.  
* Makes you take less damage while invis 
* Gives you smoke back when you turn an ally invis. 

That makes it THE exotic of choice for Pathfinders (bottom tree) in PVE.  But of limited use to other trees or in PVP.  

Players quickly noticed 2 other functions:
1. Going invis through ""other means"" (besides bottom tree smoke) also returned a significant amount of smoke charge - This included using the exotic weapon Rat King.
2. Running into smoke ""late"" on bottom tree had the same effect.

This ""unintended"" behavior made the exotic extremely valuable in both PVE and PVP for all 3 classes of Nighstalker.  Having a high uptime on smokes to slow Crycoclasm Titans with Felwinters was *helpful*.  Not even close to meta or broken--just kind of a fun thing to try to spec into.  It still wasn't as strong as Withering Blades or Duskfield Grenades.  

Last week, in the TWAB, Bungie acknowledged that the unintended behavior was a bug, but their promised fix left some room for doubt as to how badly the exotic would be nerfed:  ""Omioculus also no longer grants melee energy when making only yourself invisible under some circumstances. ""  it's an ambiguous sentence, but I maintained hope that only some circumstances were being fixed (The bottom tree late-invis bug seemed like a prime candidate).

It was the first thing I tested this mornng after the update, and sure enough ALL of the cool behaviors are gone.  Rat King no longer has any synergy.  Top and Middle tree no longer gain any smoke charge on dodge.

Top tree Nighstalker is a subclass that needs help right now.  I really don't think nerfing unintended benfits to a weak subclass was the right choice.",1615918587,2021-03-16 14:16:27

Quote:  

&gt;We wanted to share a change coming to Seals and Titles in Season 13. As I'm sure you've noticed, we've been shipping a Flawless and Conqueror Title each of the last three Seasons. We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!¬†¬†  
As always, we start with the goals:¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Allow players to show off their engagement with the core rituals season over Season.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Preserve the value of earning the base Title.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Decrease the amount of grind required Season over Season for players that want to earn them all.¬†

Yet as seen on [braytech.org](https://braytech.org) that the requirements for Conqueror Gilded is to do all 6 (seen here on my profile: [https://braytech.org/2/4611686018428608568/2305843009264934121/triumphs/seal/3776992251](https://braytech.org/2/4611686018428608568/2305843009264934121/triumphs/seal/3776992251))

this means you will only be able to Gild Conqueror 3 weeks before the end of the season. Meanwhile, Trials/Gambit/Unbroken could have been achieved since Week 1.

The only thing they said concering this issue is that a damage reduction was unintetended but the damage against bosses is still basically the same the only thing that really changed was the damge ""bonus"" against non boss targets so they didnt nessecarly have to have lied when they implied that they would fix any uninteded damage reduction bc when you just look at boss damage there technically wasnt a damage reduction so there is nothing to fix.

DestinyTheGame,My extremely fun warlock build,"My extremely fun warlock build that, while not being too overpowered, is very fun:

Loadout:

Top tree dawnblade with strafe glide for celestial fire

Claws of ahamkara for double celestial fire

Max strength for quicker recharging

Monte Carlo for quicker recharging and a chance to completely recharge

2 weapons for yellow bars

&amp;#x200B;

How to use:

Use celestial fire on EVERYTHING while in the air, even if you only kill one enemy with it each time, you will get 2 and wait a couple seconds and you will get another.

If you run out of charges, use Monte Carlo on a couple of red bars to get your celestial fire back.

If you encounter something that doesn't have a red/orange health bar, use your other weapons as celestial fire doesn't do enough damage.

DestinyTheGame,Destiny 2 Unplayable (steam),"In the last couple months, for some reason Destiny 2 refuses to run properly. At some point the game began to consistently drop frames and crash. At first it was an issue of connecting to servers, but as a D1 player I was use to the copious amounts of error codes and server drops. Then after a while the frame drop and crashing began and has only increased since. At the start of it I was able to relaunch and load as a different character then swap back, but this no longer works. Normally it will allow me to load the character and stay in orbit, but the moment I try to launch anything, the game begins the afore mentioned issues. This is the only game that I have that acts this way, I have also tried verifying the files and reinstalling, but this did not change anything.

Hoping that I can save myself some time and sanity by leveraging the community instead of testing it myself. Is there actually a boost from dragonfly spec? I've seen posts that it has not increased damage or distance, but am hoping that this was fixed. Does anyone have any experience or links to videos that could help explain?",1615915295,2021-03-16 13:21:35
DestinyTheGame,"4-12 person Nightfalls etc. could work, with some loot and achievements restrictions.","Okay, over rewarding events can destabilize a games overall balance.  I get it.  Once one area (such as 12 person NFs) is more rewarding, people will gravitate more toward that event, especially if it‚Äôs beneficial to do so.  This could cause population issues in other instances/events.

But as far as large fireteams are concerned, let‚Äôs face it Bungie, you opened a can of worms that can never be put back.  Almost anyone who participated had a blast.

So, how would a compromise look going forward?

An initial compromise would probably be ‚Äúonly drop rewards for the intended amount of players‚Äù.  So, if it is a nightfall, the rewards would be capped randomly at 3 persons.  This, 12 people, 6 people, or whatever, would share the loot of 3 people.  Etc.

Also, the runs should not count toward normal achievements.  For instance, a ‚Äúflawless Presage‚Äù should not count if it was done in 4 or more people.  

I could also see changing the point requirements to 200k points needed for 4+ players, etc.

DestinyTheGame,Season of the Hive/Taken Love Anyone?,"Apologies for the long post incoming. Just excited/curious:

I'm sure some of you have recently seen the outpouring of support and love for SIVA in the last few days with Plague Gang, and Season of the Plague. In all honesty I didn't know people had such a deep love for the...concept(?). My question is, despite knowing that Season of the Hunt was arguably Hive focused and Witch Queen will more than likely focus on the Hive/Taken, why haven't we gotten Seasons dedicated to our Sword Logic loving boys and girls? 

I can only imagine the Season leading up to Witch Queen will focus on them and as said before, so will the expansion, but what do you guys think of the Hive having a run at a Season? I think Steeplechase was a good step in the right direction, but I've found it odd that besides Shadowkeep, armor sets and Hive weapons have been somewhat scarce? Only some of the weapons from Shadowkeep have Hive-like crust and mold on them, while the rest I'd argue look more in line with Eris Morn's pattern of armor/weapons. My fear is that the set we saw a few weeks back in the State of the Game looked more Eris inspired than say the sets we got in Kings Fall and Crota's End. If I'm honest...those sets from KF and CE are S tier, and I'd much rather have something look closer to that.

I'm not looking to bash armor design or anything, just curious if people are hungry for anything Hive related. I can understand if it's played out a bit with D1 being very Hive focused with Taken King and Crota's End, and so perhaps there is an oversaturation, but it seems weird that throughout the life span of D2, Hive focused content has been sparse. Just looking from vanilla D2 to what we have now, there are at least three Vex armor sets (the GoS set, the ornaments, and the Season of the Undying armor/ornaments), many, many Cabal sets that ranged from across the Leviathan raids, to even this Season, and more than a few Fallen sets (arguably the bulk of the Forsaken gear, which was also Awoken inspired).

And this isn't just armor sets or weapons I'm talking about, I also just mean lore wise. There's so much about the Hive that is fascinating *\*makes startling Toland noises\*.* And yet theres so much to explore. Like we still have no idea what Savathun's forces look like, despite her having a hold on the Taken. Xivu Arath is more than likely getting close to the system given her play in Season of the Hunt, and the idea that she's at war with her sister is just.....awesome. There's so much untapped story potential that Witch Queen is going to have, just thinking about it is....bone chilling. 

Hell, even the aesthetic is great. Shadowkeep is basically space Barad-Ur. I can't tell you how often I go to the moon just to explore the catacombs, because there is literally nothing else like it in the game *\*wishes for the return of the Dreadnought\**. There's a lot of Hive stuff coming I have no doubt, but compared to what we have its just so...little. This is especially evident as we look to potential alliances with both Fallen and Cabal, which would in theory only leave the Vex, Hive/Taken, and Scorn left (I do have a theory that the next saga of Destiny could potentially open up to players playing as these races as well as our current cropping of humans, Exo, and Awoken. Like you could play as a ""saved"" Hive that has reverted back to Krynn(?), Kryll(?), etc.).

I'd wager next Season could be Vex focused given the return of the Vault of Glass and Ikora's return to prominence as well as the previously mentioned final Season leading to Witch Queen being potentially Hive/Taken focused (but who knows?). 

So yeah, what do you guys think? Is SIVA more inspired because its been inactive for sometime? Would you like a Hive/Taken Season? Or is it played out, etc. Let me know below, just thought it'd be a cool conversation to have.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Thoughts on a Hive/Taken focused Season? What kind of armor sets/weapons would be cool? Is it played out? Or would you rather have a season of SIVA etc.",1615914976,2021-03-16 13:16:16

DestinyTheGame,Sunsetting sunsetting was a start now try this Bungie...,"The sun set on sunsetting and I'm thankful. But I think design wise Bungie still has the question in their collective minds; how do we keep the game fresh?

Well I can't help but notice that each season the champion mods drive my loadouts. Subtle changes that effect how I play champion based content like Nightfalls and Lost Sectors. 

But this has me thinking the seasonal artifact is key. Can we find a way to make those seasonal mods even more effective to overall gameplay?

What about a skill tree, what about specializing in say crucible or gambit specific mods that define the PVP part of the game the way champion mods do for PVE?

I think this eliminates the need to ever consider sunsetting again and move to meaningfully manipulate player builds in game.

I did not agree to have content taken away from me, except by acquiescence and now I don‚Äôt get to take my friend through the story from beginning to end because Bungie wants to resell me stories I already paid for. 

This practice needs to stop. It‚Äôs not right. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a broken system.‚Äù If the game is getting too big, then put out a Destiny 3. People will wait. But taking AWAY content cannot happen any more.",1615913710,2021-03-16 12:55:10

Hi Guardians

bungie being ignoring thousands of players in Middle East region, for damn long since D1 they suffer the pain of high ping in Crucible and PVE activity, Bungie it's time to open a server for us we bought the game the dlc and even support the game via their shop/store we deserve a server like every other guardian , many other gaming companies have reginal server either in UAE or Bahrain or KSA, there's no lack of anything to stop bungie from doing that.

I'm new to Destiny 2 and played the bit I could play in the F2P version of Destiny.  
I got to know that two previous campaigns got vaultet (for whatever reason) and I am totally lost how to play the game as a solo player going forward.

Which DLC should I buy first? Which purposes can I pursuit?  


Help or simple links to great new player ressources are appreciated!

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie has put themselves in a tricky situation. The stasis subclasses now revolve around a single stasis trick, upon which a nerf to any of it, will kill the class.","Revenant is getting nerfed. And thank god for it, can't wait. They're only going to slow. That means they're leaving the freezes to the warlocks, and I guess the....instant 1HKO stuff to the Titan. 

But let's try and break this down a bit and see what ability each class is good at.

* Revenant: Post nerf, they're pretty much exclusively the slowing class. The melee gives 4 stacks of slow, the dodge gives 4 stacks of slow, if they want to freeze someone they literally have to use three abilities all back to back to back _and_ be relatively close to the enemy too. So for all intents and purposes, in the average match, they're only going to slow. Hell, even the tornado slows. Slow is a powerful mechanic right now, but it's the only thing Revenants can do.

* Shadebinder: Freezes. Instant freezes. The rift is a 5 second freeze, the melee is a ~1.5 second freeze, killing frozen targets freezes more nearby targets, their super instantly freezes anything hit by the projectiles, they excel at quick and fast freezing. Cool. Good and well defined philosophy here, we know what they're good for. But with each nerf to freeze (frozen targets take less damage), it's tricky to imagine how well this class will survive in the future.

* Behemoth: Instant death and movement, I guess? The melee applies slow, but you'll be hard pressed not to get instant 1HKO'ed against a wall. Seriously, just try and use this thing in crucible and land a non-lethal blow. Then they have the aspect that instantly freezes anyone in front of them for 5 full seconds after sliding. They have powerful movement, and their super is the only super that can instantly kill any guardian just with the light attack (no set up, no follow-up, just an instant kill). Seems well defined, I guess, if not maybe a little much. But that's beside the point. This is a good class that is not tied to any one stasis gimmick.

Now here's the problem. Stasis slow is a pretty powerful mechanic. I think it's wildly powerful, but that's just the thing. Any nerfs to it will _heavily_ neuter Revenants more than any other class. I totally think they should remove the accuracy penalties, but aside from Duskfields (getting nerfed on their own), calls for stais slow nerfs are basically just calls to nerf revenants. No other class can slow.

And Stasis freeze. It's a very annoying high-death-chance mechanic that gives extremely little chance for counterplay. But it's being nerfed further, and when you're frozen, you're going to now taken even less damage (noted in the Road To Witch Queen balance preview). So this nerf is just going to hurt Shadebinders more than any other class in the game. Other classes can definitely freeze, but Warlocks excel at it, and they'd be hurt the most.

Behemoths are the only class that seem relatively immune to any general stasis nerfs, because their class doesn't rely on stasis, they just have a ridiculously strong slide and a 1HKO melee. Even their super can just instant 1HKO guardians without needing to freeze them first. 

**So while I think the upcoming balance changes are great and they lay out exactly how Stasis should have launched**, I worry to think on how Bungie is going to perform future balance changes. They can't do general stasis nerfs without these nerfs heavily hurting one class more than the other.

I don't now how USA is, but mid EU is very bad for me. 

Just this morning, I got ONE game out of ~10 where there were not at least two players teleporting around and dying after couple of seconds. Melee trades after 1 sec is a very common ability by now. 

Almost every game is a laggy shitshow.

DestinyTheGame,If you're grinding Gambit for a god roll Bottom Dollar..,"In my quest to get a God roll Bottom Dollar, I have some information to share.

I did not keep track of everything I got because I never thought I would take it this far, but curfew in my part of the world gave me plenty of time to waste.

My seasonal Gambit infamy score is 200,000. Motes banked, 20,000.

My first Bottom Dollar was a decently rolled Quickdraw/HIR. I got it after about 15-20 matches. I should've quit then, but here we are.

At around 90,000 Infamy rank, I got a very very good Surplus/Explosive payload. But it just didn't fit my play style since I used abilities, the inconsistencies bothered me on a hand cannon. (I love it on my Frozen Orbit)

At approx 120,000 I got an Outlaw/Multikill Clip, which is awesome for 6s, but I'm more of a 3s type of guy. Still awesome to have in the vault.

At approx 190,000 I got a God Rolled Rangerfinder/Opening shot. It has a good barrel, steadyrounds and a handling masterwork. It's awesome.

That said, I still didn't get MY god roll of quickdraw/explosive payload.

Along the way I've gotten a few other decent rolls, I would say about 5 of them were good. But only 3 were very good. I would estimate all my BD drops to amount to about 25-30.

Another thing I noticed is I only got 1 with Opening Shot and probably 5-6 with Hipfire (FACEPALM).

Hear me out.

There is a good reason that in one of the first BL cutscenes the only person we see using stasis is The Stranger.  They also didn't just include 3 People using darkness for no reason.  Its because The Stranger, Eris Morn, and The Drifter all represent a part of the darkness. 

Stranger- Stasis
Eris- Soulfire
Drifter- gambit ???(fuckifiknow)

Ok hats off, but still, pretty neat thought I had. Anyone have any clues as to what the Drifter's ""subclass"" may be? Kinda hoping its some kind of energy manipulation or minion summoning ability.

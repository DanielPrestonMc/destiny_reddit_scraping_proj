1,"The Darkness or Savathûn might be influencing Saladin, among other Gaurdians!","After seeing the arguement at the Helm this reset, I started to wonder if Saladin MIGHT be under the influence of the Darkness/Savathûn.. 

First off, all of his dialogue this season is WILD, dark and out there. He never fought during the Red War, and obviously feels a little guilty about that but using it at every turn to put down the idea of becoming allies with the Cabal seems odd. The Iron Lords wouldn't even give Dark Gaurdians/Warlods (different but similar) final deaths and were upset about Felwinter doing it, they just dont seem like the types to believe ""killing is the only option"". Also, the way Saladin threw the Psion from the wall was very dark. Enemies are enemies but causing unnecessary pain or fear isn't the Guardians' style. Saladin speaking about ""raz(ing) the Cabal Empire to ashes"" and saying the times of Gaurdians being gaurds and not invaders should change- sounds much more Warlord than Iron Lord to me.

To honestly think about it, the last thing Darkness or Savathûn would want would be for humanity to become allied with yet ANOTHER Species of Sol (the Eliksni House of Light well on its way to being the first). Savathûn has played tricks getting us at each others throats over and over, while the Darkness sent the communication about the power on Europa to the entire Sol System. Hive, Cabal, Humans, Fallen all saw the message and we have already gone to war with one of them over it. So not only does it seem like the last thing our enemies want is for us to make Allies (duh), but both Savathûn and The Darkness are making noticeable efforts to prevent it. AND we have seen the effects of Savathûn influencing the Vanguard already. Why wouldn't she want to put us against one another? Divide and conquer and all that..

But that's just how I have perceived things, maybe I've missed something or I'm sure there are reasons some people would believe Saladin could never become influenced. Either way I'd like to hear other supporting evidence or evidence to the contrary. It's awesome to have such a deeply rich lore and history we as a community can debate about."

1,This game feels impenetrable for me as a new player,"After slowly making my way through a huge backlog of games I've finally gotten round to destiny 2

1,GM's being gated at 1325 power is pointless and stupid,"Before we start lets get some things out of the way. Being a casual or a hardcore player doesn't have anything to do with time commitment to the game. 

For instance: My son, a casual, loves destiny and plays a ridiculous amount. He's ready for GM's based almost solely on artifact level. He does do some of the easier pinnacles but he will never play a GM and will never step foot in Trials. Skill level-wise, he just isn't there. 

Now for myself, I'm a hardcore player. I love destiny but have super limited time to play. When I do play I enjoy a challenge. I enjoy making builds and formulating plans to beat challenging content including Trials. I am not GM ready. I may barely be GM ready by end of season based on my schedule and the fact that pvp is my passion in Destiny. 

My issue with GM's being gated at 1325 power level is fairly simple. 

**1325 power level is not a gauge for how skilled a player may be. It is only a number that portrays a persons time and dedication to the grind. That is all.**

I've seen people argue that GM's aren't for casuals. But their definition of casual for some reason involves the amount of time you have to play. That just isn't true. You can be a hardcore player with little time to play. You can be a casual with tons of time to play.

Either way, having GM's gated by a 1325 power cap really leaves out the hardcore players that don't have a lot of time to commit to the pinnacle grind. It's really an arbitrary number that Bungie made up to keep people grinding past the season pass levels.

On the flip side, Trials is gated almost completely by skill level. If you want the pinnacles and adept loot you have to be skilled enough. So I get my adept loot from Trials because of my skill level. There is no arbitrary number blocking me from attempting it. 

The same should go for GM's. GM's should be completely about build crafting, great teamplay and skill. But it currently isn't. My son, the 1325 casual, could jump into one and not be able to complete it. 

I, on the other hand, can definitely complete a GM but I'm not 1325 so I can't even try.

As a hardcore player that wants to play GM's, I currently can't based SOLELY on lack of time. I may make 1325 by end of season. We shall see."

1,There should be an option in the stasis subclass menu that let's you choose how your super behaves in PvE.,"I love the addition of Stasis in PvE and how customisable it is, but I feel like the supers are very limiting in their utility. For example, the hunter stasis super is great at ad clear but not very good at dps because the stasis tornado prioritised ads over the most powerful combatant on the field. The titan stasis super is again, fantastic at ad clear and just completely controlling the battlefield, but by nature of being a roaming super, it isn't that great at boss dps. The warlock super seems like a nice balance of ad clear and dps, but there could definitely be much more in the way of support utility.

I would love to see a setting in the subclass menu that allows you to modify the behaviour of the super. For example, there should be a setting for the hunter stasis super that allows you to modify the behaviour of the stasis tornado so that it prioritises the most powerful combatant on the field over the ads so you can do big damage by combining the tick damage of the tornado with special or heavy weapons fire. For titans, it could modify the super where there's a freeze on cast, and then one big punch attack for big burst dps on a boss with a decently large detonation radius to get ads near the boss with shatter damage. The warlock super is decent at sustained dps, but there could be an option for either higher damage detonations at the cost of more super energy, or perhaps a support behaviour where casting a light attack on a fireteam member gives that fireteam member a regenerating overshield that doesn't last as long or regenerate as fast as solar well super, but allows the team mates to be mobile instead of standing in a given area, or even something similar to the void hunter tether where its a single freeze attack that hits for large damage on cast and then debuffs bosses so they receive more damage, and to differentiate from tether, it could be a debuff that gives extra damage to light based attacks and supers, so you can have good team synergy with someone running ad clear, the warlock casts on the boss, then another player using a burst damage super like thundercrash or golden gun for biiiig burst dps."
1,The Unknown Solo Flawless Prophecy Meta (a Guide),"Recently, I decided to tackle solo flawless prophecy. That emblem is just too cool. I'm a solidly above average player, maybe even good - I've failed Day 1 raids, solo flawlessed Pit (with ball duping\*), and have done a solid number of raid runs. But I'm certainly not elite. So, I wanted to figure out the easiest loadout/strategy for actually getting it done. Online guides seemed like a solid start.

So, I went about and read all the guides available online - most from before Beyond Light. Most of them said to use some combination of Anarchy, Mountaintop, Blinding Grenade Truthteller, Xeno, Witherhoard, etc. That seemed reasonable to me – Anarchy/Witherhoard are great DPS options for the kell echo, Xenophage melts knights, blinding grenades can help with the adds, and so on. Then when I was actually trying it, I felt like I was trying to juggle too much in my head to maintain staying alive. Especially in the beginning of the encounters with all the adds spawning at once, I just couldn’t get the encounter under control quick enough to stay alive. Mote timers, managing add/boss positioning, not dying to adds and clearing them before psions split too many times, and so on.

I thought to myself, how can I make this a bit easier? I decided that at the end of the day, all the encounters are a lot more manageable if you completely delete the minor adds from the equation. On the phalanx, you only have to worry about knights and the boss so it’s a lot easier to find pockets to heal yourself without psions peppering you with little shots all the time. In the cube, likewise if you’re only worried about the knights/hobgoblins, no acolytes and such, the encounter is trivial. For the final boss, I felt like DPS was always a pretty easy part and I didn’t mind doing a ton of phases as long as I could get through the initial rooms reliably – and in that room, again, only worrying about the kell echo copies and knights would make it a lot easier. 

So that all sounds great, and the loadout was pretty apparent: I needed add clear. So I started testing some runs with Trinity Ghoul as the exotic of choice.

The result is this guide. I included a lot of encounter guide text/tips, because there are certain small details that I realized are key to making the encounters manageable, or even easy, as I continued to do runs.

# The Loadout

**Kinetic: Heritage w/ Reconstruction (sub: Sniper for wasteland if desired)**

Heritage will be your main knight killer – that’ll be pretty much its sole purpose. Within range, it’ll stagger knights on a precision hit and takes two precisions or one precision two body to kill the knights.

**Energy: Trinity Ghoul w/ Completed Catalyst (mandatory)**

Your add deleter. However, it’s important to know how to make use of Trinity Ghoul since it isn’t really like any other weapon. If lightning rod isn’t procced, your first goal is to kill an add with it ADS/hipfire – you’ll have to aim. Once it **is** procced, your goal is to keep it procced. For enemies that take more than one shot to kill (hobgoblins in cube, for instance), make sure you still kill it with Trinity to get the perk to proc again. The biggest benefit of lightning rod is that it’ll remove entire groups of psions while hardly aiming – even if they’ve split a million times. Once lightning rod is procced, you really shouldn’t be ADSing all that much. If you have the extra time to, sure, go ahead, but at the beginning of encounters with a lot of hectic adds, don’t. In fact, don’t even fully draw the arrow. The arrows don’t need to hit or do maximum damage, they’re really just vehicles for your palpatine energy. In fact, less draw lets them spread out more. Using it this way is what really lets you focus on the other parts of the encounters – mechanics, staying alive, and knights – without really worrying about the adds. As long as every shot kills at least one enemy, as long as you don’t completely whiff on a very forgiving shot, lightning rod will remain procced.

**Heavy: Falling Guillotine (sub: Machine Gun for wasteland if desired)**

Your DPS. Can be used for knights if they’re standing in the right light in cube, but wouldn’t risk it for other encounters.

# Armor

We’ll be deleting adds as soon as they spawn, for the most part, but getting to the point where the knights/bosses are all that remains requires some good survivability. Because we’re running TG, we don’t have a reliable way of spawning warmind cells. So we go all in with a Protective Light build:

2x Void Armor: Protective Light, Stacks on Stacks

2x Solar Armor: Supercharged, Charged Up/Supercharged

Any Armor: Taking Charge

Class Item: Passive Guard (optional, makes DPS easier)

Taking Charge is great here because Trinity Ghoul is an orb making machine. Rarely should you go lower than 4x stacks with the above loadout unless your shields have just broken, in which case you’ll have 20+ seconds to heal and go make more orbs.

**The rest below will focus encounter strategy, with some Warlock specific notes (I highly recommend Warlock for the easiest solo flawless runs due to devour and well).**

# Encounter Notes

# Initial Caves

This is pretty easy, clear the thrall with trinity ghoul to get some orbs for protective light and then go ape the knights. Use the last 2 knights in the first area (after a respawn) to bring dark motes into the second area since that’s much easier than making dark motes within the second part.

# Phalanx 

**Subclass, Mods:** Well of Radiance, 2x Concussive Dampener

**Adds**: 

· Four knights – they only respawn when all four are killed

· Groups of psions spawn every time motes are dunked

· Goblins spawn halfwayish through DPS

**General Notes:**

Like other guides recommend, for the majority of this encounter you’ll be running loops around the edge. Trinity Ghoul will delete psions in groups very easily and make plenty of orbs of light to maintain protective light’s availability. When all four knights are up, try to take one out with trinity ghoul before trying to shotgun them. Rushing four with heritage gets dicey, even with protective light. Trinity ghoul is nice here because without having to aim, it’s pretty easy to keep on the move and quickly turn towards the groups of enemies and fire off some lightning.

On that note, since the knights spawn separated a bit, it can be easy to immediately take one out as it spawns with heritage which makes it all more manageable (do this every time they respawn).

Anyway, pre-dps cycle goes like this: kill psions with Trinity Ghoul, picking off a knight with heritage if the opportunity arises in a relatively safeish area, ensure you have stacks of CwL, shotgun 1-2 more knights to get the motes required to dunk, go dunk, and repeat.

Remember none of the adds are on a timer in this encounter. In a pinch, you can always just drop your well and then delay DPS until you have it back up.

Only other tip is if you get booped off, try and turn around and glide towards the edge. You’ll get “joining allies” and should be able to delay until the timer runs out – but you’ll lose CwL stacks and lightning rod.

**DPS Notes:** 

As other guides mention, drop a well so goblins can’t shield, and lay into the phalanx with your sword. This will result in a 2-phase after the sword nerfs. If you want to 1-phase (it’s tight), you can take a quarter to a third of the phalanx’s health off before dropping the well (using passive guard, concussive dampener, and protective light to stay alive), then drop the well and continue DPS. If you’re 2 phasing, feel free to rip into the goblins with your sword once the phalanx only has a third or so of its health left – the multikills will create a bunch of orbs for CwL.

# Wasteland

**Subclass, Mods:** Well of Radiance or Devour Voidlock, 1x Sniper 1x Concussive

**Adds**: 

· Groups of thrall at each set of bubbles

· 3x Hobgoblins on pillars at each set of bubbles

· 3x of varying major adds at each set of bubbles – Captains, Phalanxes, Hobgoblins, Centurions, etc.

**General Notes:**

A nice easy break after the phalanx, just don’t turn your brain off. Usually there’s a minotaur somewhere nearby the bubbles – you don’t necessarily have to kill it, but be wary of it. Start each set of bubbles by picking the hobgoblins off at a distance with TG. Then you can either drop a well near the major adds and shotgun/sword them, or proc devour and go at them. Use the thrall to keep devour procced as needed (TG or sword works). Just take it slow. You can also swap to a sniper and pick off majors from distance too.

# Cube

**Subclass, Mods:** Devour Voidlock, 1x Sniper 1x Concussive

**Adds:**

· 2x groups of acolytes at beginning of each room and then on a timer

· 2x Major Hobgoblins / 2x Major Knights – kill hobgoblin, knight spawns; kill knight, hobgoblin spawns

**General Notes:**

Surprisingly not too bad of an encounter with devour coupled with trinity ghoul. At the start of each room, quickly check what mote type you need and then go into one of the corners (try and choose one with a pillar or two for cover from hobgoblins but don’t worry too much). While going to that corner, proc devour with your grenade.

Once in the corner, use trinity ghoul (which is hopefully already procced) to quickly eliminate the majority of the acolytes before too many eyes spawn. This will also make a ton of orbs for CwL and keep your health high from devour.

Next, use 2-3 ADS trinity ghoul shots to take out each hobgoblin. If all arrows crit, it’ll only take two. You should be left with only the two knights left, which is easy to manage. If you’re feeling confident, didn’t take a long time clearing the adds/hobgoblins, and the knights are sitting in or are near the right light, just go sword/shotgun them real quick before the next group of adds spawn. Otherwise, just whiddle their health down and let the next group of acolytes spawn, kill them (trinity ghoul), then you have plenty of time for the knights.

Try to end each room with (1) lightning rod procced, (2) at least 4x CwL stacks, and (3) grenade up for devour. If you do all that, surviving the first part of each room is trivial, and once you have the adds and hobgolbins gone, it’s no harder than the first encounter (before the phalanx).

**DPS:**

Please, just nova one of the centurions and then sword to finish and sword the other. No tricks needed, it’s cheese.

# Wasteland Pt 2

Only giving this a section to mention sparrow to the rainbow road using the ridge to the left to shield you from where the adds spawn (bow out a bit to the left). Worst part of a solo flawless run would be dying because the adds spawn and explode your sparrow.

# Rainbow Road

I see a lot of advice to take the platforms and jump down – which sure, do that if that’s what you’re comfortable with. But the only time I did that I missed a jump and died, since I had never gone that route and was used to sparrowing. So I just sparrowed it as normal, with the caveat where any time I felt even a little dicey I (a) stopped boosting or (b) jumped off sparrow and glided to middle of track.

Use the thrall at the end to proc lighting rod and get max CwL stacks.

# Kell Echo

**Subclass, Mods:** Devour Voidlock, 2x Concussive, Sword and Shotgun ammo finders

**Adds:** 

· 2x Knights, respawn whenever one killed

· 3x groups of psions, respawn on timer

· Ogre whenever deleting a kell echo

· Sets of 2x hobgoblins during DPS that spawn as boss teleports each time

**General Notes:**

Perhaps the 2nd hardest encounter, which is annoying since it comes at the end. The **most** important thing is to start each non-DPS room with max CwL stacks, a grenade for devour, and ideally lightning rod procced (though you can get by without that).

You goal on entering a room is to go to the cover along one of the triangle edges, proc devour while adds are spawning in, then palpatine the shit out of all of the psions. Ignore the knights.

Once the psions are all dead, quickly go shotgun the knights. Unless you have 3 of the same required mote type, it doesn’t matter where they’re standing as long as you get the same type of mote from each. Immediately go dunk them – deleting a single kell echo makes the room very manageable.

After the first dunk, you should be able to reproc devour and sword the ogre. If more psions are spawning by now, go shotgun the other 2 knights – try and do so within the devour window. If they are, kill them first and then do the knights. With only a single kell echo left, you should be able to shotgun the knights and dunk it before the third wave of psions spawn. No biggie if not, since with only one kell echo, there’s plenty of safer areas and you have palpatine on your side. Just try not to dunk with a hoarde of psions around you.

So, just remember: sword ogres as they spawn, keep devour up as much as possible (not as difficult as it seems with trinity ghoul and shotgunning a knight down only taking 2-3 shots), if you need a breather chill in an area you already dunked with devour up.

Remember there’s no timer so before going down to DPS, you can always wait for psions to spawn and farm ammo. Like with the phalanx, if you’re caught without a grenade and need/want devour to proc, don’t hesitate to nova bomb some psions or knights. You can always DPS without it or wait to DPS until its back up.

**DPS:**

Before getting to the nitty gritty details of how to run this, the general flow is: stay **ahead** of the boss, kill hobgoblins as they spawn, avoid boss teleport attacks, and then DPS with sword at the end.

As you enter the room, nova bomb the boss. It’ll take a few tries to get used to the aim, but after that it’s always the same and a good way to start DPS off. Then immediately jump to the left platform (where the first hobgoblin will spawn in) while avoiding the boss’s teleport. On this platform, the short little pillar will shield you from his teleport for the most part. When the hobgoblins spawn in, shotgun the one on the platform you’re at and a single TG shot should kill the one across. The boss will teleport shortly after that.

When he teleports, you should be able to pick off at least one (preferably both) of the two new hobgoblins before he uses the teleport attack. You basically have time to get two bow shots off. Once you do, jump diagnolly right and finish off a hobgoblin if left over. Spend the rest of the time until more hobgoblins spawn in avoiding the boss’s teleport.

Continue this all the way down the room. You should be using the lull during his teleports to pick off hobgoblins, and then when you hear him do the teleport attack, jump up ahead to be closer to him or even past him. There should never be more than two hobgoblins up at a time, and ideally even when there is two only one should be able to get a shot off. While jumping down the room, don’t worry about DPS – at most, just throw a grenade or pepper him with some bow shots if you have time.

Once the last hobgoblins are up on the final platform, kill them with TG but don’t shoot TG anymore at the boss – you want the lightning rod for the next room. If you’re quick, you can create an orb of light while killing them – save this orb to get CwL just prior to going back up the lift.

You should be getting to the final platform **before** the boss. Once the boss teleports to the final platform, just go sword him – I only used light attacks for consistency. If you can, attack him from an angle such that his stomp – if it does happen to bounce you – only bounces you up the steps rather than off the map. With the combination of 2x concussive, passive guard, and protective light (if your shield breaks), you don’t need any healing to do damage. In fact, you can sometimes finish without even having your shields broken.

Using this DPS structure – Nova Bomb, then minimal damage until sword on last teleport – you should be getting 20-30% of damage each phase. That’s not ideal for a solo flawless – with other loadouts some people reliably 3-phase – but again, the goal here is surviving in the other rooms. Which this loadout excels at. 4-5 Phasing isn't too bad given how much easier TG and devour makes the first room.

Once the boss leaves, don't leave the room until your grenade is up. You can take some time to gather yourself as well, your CwL and lightning rod doesn't have a timer so if you need a bit of time take it.

The only run killer in the DPS room I’ll mention is panicking while getting teleported. You **will** mess up and get teleported at some point – that’s no big deal. You can catch up, and usually still beat the boss to the final platform. What **is** a big deal is panicking when it happens. If you get hit, immediately stop pressing any buttons until your vision comes back. You don’t want to accidentally drop off a ledge.

If you somehow get teleported mid sword swing – it happened once or twice to me – you may come back midair. In this case, strafe guide and pressing it immediately when your vision comes back will let you safely get back to a platform (may have to mantle). Still, don’t panic and you’ll be fine."

1,Riskrunner visual nerf and Keratoconus,"Hey Bungie. Not sure if you'll see this, but just wanted to send a simple thank you for nerfing the visual insanity which was Riskrunner; also an apology to those who enjoyed it, as it gets nerfed on behalf of people like me (lol). I know this change was primarily intended for seizures, but as a person with rapidly worsening keratoconus, this change is a lifesaver...er, eyesaver. Yeah.

I already play at 1 brightness on PC with night light enabled, or flux, whatever you'd like to refer to it as. It sucks, I wouldn't recommend it. Long story short, Riskrunner has always been my favorite weapon in the game. I've been using it since launch. The power of the visual effect really became apparent to me when Devil's Lair was reissued. It was the first time I had to take breaks from playing the game due to my eyes. It's a very flashy game in general, so I'm not solely blaming the Riskrunner for my discomfort...but GOD DAMN the tune y'all applied really makes my life a lot easier. Again, sorry to the folks who loved how badass that chain lightning was, but thank u Bungie...even if it wasn't directly meant for me. Good shit. Would be cool if you could toggle the effect for all my peeps who may miss it. I think you'll be thanking Bungie for sparing your corneas later, though."

Warlock’s pulse grenades don’t cause damage on impact like Titan’s pulse grenades do so they do less damage. I mean, how is that fair? If I run thru a Titan’s barricade I lose about 75% of my health! Meanwhile, opponents can stand, dance, or even have a tea party in my rift with no consequences! Shouldn’t they take damage as well or at least be slowed, blinded, or suppressed? Lastly, shouldn’t the Skull of Dire Ahamkara give Warlocks the same amount of super energy for hits &amp; kills as the Shards of Galanor gives Hunters?🤔 If I’m being unreasonable, tell me but I think my complaints are legitimate."
1,Why did Bungie sunset the Dreaming City and Reef Gambit maps?,"Say whatever you want about them as maps (looking at you Reef) but Gambit needs more than 4 maps. We all want a Europa one, but why remove 2 other maps?"
1,Are there any other shelter from the storm glitches for DSC?,"They seemed to have patched the air lock glitch with this most recent update, I don’t usually have trouble doing the route normally but getting tired of waiting forever on lfg ppl that can’t seem to get it down lol"
1,Don't forget about the point of the stag for this week's NF,"Running GM's last night, I was about to put on an arsenic bite and remembered the point of the stag. It has archers tempo and vorpal weapon, which both come in handy on NF's, especially GM's."
1,Getting back into the game. What could I miss?,"So I had played destiny a couple of years ago, and I am starting to play again. As a solo player I had mainly played the activities that had matchmaking (Crusible, Strikes, Gambit), although I remember doing the weekly Nightfall (i think using the app) and once doing a raid (again through the app) but having no idea of what to do and basically following others instructions. 

Recently I started playing again. I did a couple of missions that are intro to the new expansions, noticed there is a battle pass and for some reason secondary weapons have shotguns and snipers. I also noticed that the app for finding teams is still around.

My main question is about activities I could be missing. Is there anything new like the gambit was shortly before I stopped playing ? Is there a faster way to grow my power level than doing bointies daily getting new gear? And finally how much worth is are the expansions and the battle pass. Do they add anything new to the game other than story/items ? 

Thanks in advance. 

tl;dr: what is knew in destiny after forsaken and what could a player returning miss?"
1,Recommend using Sundering Glare in Devil's Lair GM,"Not going to be a long drawn out post. You can hide from the Fallen Walker Tank, just enough to see its legs and keep proc'ing Sundering Glare on it while Anarchy bolts wear it down. It made the fight in that 'space' go a bit faster. Good luck y'all."
1,Constantly “fixing” the DSC sparrow section sucks. It was a poorly designed area and people skipping it is clearly evident of that. Now I have zero reason to log into the game anymore.,"Why are you so focused on forcing us to do your stupid sparrow run? Look I like the concept, I really do. And the SOTP sparrow run was simply amazing! (And way harder to cheese). It was really fun, the first time. After that this section is tedious and overly unforgiving. But doing this sparrow run legit every week is so uninteresting to me that I’ll just not do it. (Funny, sounds a lot like the state of Trials as well!!!)

But after patching what is now like 2 or 3 cheeses you STILL cannot stop us from doing this? Well what do ya know, you can still cheese the event glitching out of the map now. Give up. Move on.

These “fixes” don’t even fix what your trying to fix either. I get that you want people to “experience” your glorious raid *the right way*. But there is nothing stopping someone from running it solo, then inviting everyone else back at the security CP. Thus skipping the entire section anyways. Because LFG looks like this now, “DSC at security CP KWTD.”

What is so terrible about solo players (WHO HAVE TO UNLOCK THE GEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE, AKA COMPLETE THE RAID, IN ORDER TO EVEN GET DROPS FROM CHEST) getting 3 chances at quite frankly the only loot worth a damn in the game currently. I have been doing the cheese, 3 x per week, every week since BL and guess what? Still no god rolls from the raid weapons. And I raid too. I have Eyes of Tomorrow (which took a lot of runs to get). With how abysmal RNG is weighted in this game, what are you dinguses so afraid of? Oh god, no, not random blueberry 43 getting 10 raid tokens and 1 piece of random loot that is statistically going to be dog shit anyways. /s

You don’t want people to cheese your shit? Start rewarding your players time investment, add more desirable loot to the general loot pool and make encounters that don’t completely suck to do 3 times a week, every single week. FFS."

1,"Should I use my Ascendant Shards on S tier Exotics at the Kiosk, or Masterwork armor?","Looking for some advice from the Vets. Basically returned to D2 after New Light. Since then I've collected 5 Ascendant Shards. Feeling like I should use some of them. Was going to use 2 to get Anarchy when I can afford it w/ Spoils, but are any others worth it? Ace for example if its still viable in PVP? Or should I just Masterwork Armor?"

1,Can‘t gild Conqueror title yet,"We just finished the only shown objective for the gilded conqueror title and got another six objectives.
So we need to do the conqueror again to gild it even that we had it in the season it was released?
The dredgen title can be gilded without doing everything again.
And it was not shown until we finished the only objective available.
On top it doesn‘t even counted The devil‘s lair we dir four times today :-)

Is this intended or bugged?"
1,Is Destiny 2 PvP better on PC?,"Iv been playing since D1, and back then i was huge in crucible, i was always top of the leader board and the best out of my friends. However I just played for fun and never to get better. 

Fast forward a bit and D2 comes out and I play the first season and didn’t touch the game again until about a month ago. I’m slowly getting my skill back at pvp, i just need to relearn everything again like spawns and the metas in general. 

I love D2 and want to get way better then i was on crucible and was wondering if I should just move towards PC for better gameplay. If so how would I switch from my ps4 to pc without losing everything ?"
1,Since yesterday's patch. I've noticed a few weird things.,"1. When inspecting, sometimes people don't have heads.

2. When I go to postmaster, its faded out. Then I hit escape and its not the normal postmaster screen.

3. The frostbite glitch was patched, again.

4. Guardian games ghosts are borked.

Did I miss anything?!"

1,"Pro tip for easy devil’s lair, run the exotic bow trifecta","Trinity ghoul, ticcu’s divination, and le monarque. Overload bow. All elements covered. Easy overload stuns and consistent damage with all three bows. Ticcus for more consistent and stacking damage. Trinity for add clear (one shots shanks even with chain lightning). Le monarque for servitude shields and DOT splash damage with perfect draw crits on overloads.

After stunning an overload, just continue plinking away with bows and preventing health regen.  

Pair these exotics with snipers and rockets for an easy, low stress clear this week. Play it safe from a distance and get your clears."
1,The shattered meme,"Hello again, today marks the day i will venture into a few months or a year worth of my own personal hell. What i mean by this is i’m doing a shattered throne, pit of heresy, and prophecy all solo flawless
Which isn’t that hard...and you’re probably wondering you complaining asses “well anyone whos anyone has done that” which you are correct.  But instead of an actual loadout, i’m doing a meme loadout which consists of 
Traveler chosen damaged
Dead zone rifle (which is a grey sniper)
Bulter RS/2 (a green rocket launcher)
Falling star and thundercrash

Your next line is “but with falling star it’s basically easy mode” which is true, but without it each run is like...2 hours if i somehow get passed the ogre for shattered throne


To all you guardians that see this, don’t hate yourself as much as I hate myself. I will record myself doing this with the gear. 

I’m gonna say in a year i will see you starside and i will be done with at least one of these dungeons


I said this once before but it got taken down for a twitch url...anyway bye bye have a good day"
1,why does the hive continue to fight us?,"after our guardian kills two gods, three the children of the god who most understood the sword logic and was the most powerful within that logic and the other that very god that destroyed thousands and thousands of races.  one we killed them, why doesn't that prove that we are the ultimate race through the sword logic? why don't they run and hide and realize that the Hive is not a race that should live by the laws of the sword?"

1,Grandmaster Light Cap,"Bungie stated that light level is capped at 1325 for nightfall grandmaster activities.

Exactly what is the point then of leveling the seasonal artifact past level 15?  A single seasonal triumph I guess?  Comp pvp?  These don't seem like good reasons to continue to grind up levels.

Bungie crapped the bed on this one."
1,"All joking aside, the story direction is and has been provoking some great discussion.","I mean, look at where we are now. In Destiny 1 we conquered the Vault, repelled crota's incursion, then oryx and discovered the taken. Then we dealt with the scourge of the Iron Lords, SIVA. 

Then comes Destiny 2, you have the red War knocking us on our asses, stripping our light, and introducing us to the full might of the cabal empire. We would go on to discover more secrets, go through the loss of cayde 6, discover more about the awoken and learn a little bit about paracausal entities. All while fighting these supposedly mindless, faceless, brutal enemies. 

Now we've teased and tasted the darkness, dealt with the Fallout of the red War being the almighty, and the Darkness has arrived.

Now we are dealing with eliksni and cabal essentially trying to establish new homes in our solar system all while contending with the arrival of the dark Fleet.

I think that the conversations we are having, mirrored by some of the Battlegrounds banter between Crow, Osiris, Saladin, holiday are all incredibly poignant.

How far are we going to go to assure Humanity survival? Which strategy do we take? Obviously I think we're building towards an alliance between eliksni, Cabal and Guardians. But it remains interesting to see where people draw their lines in the discussion.

It's interesting to see that we have Guardians siding with Crow and saying that these are just other sentient beings trying to survive, then you have players who have survived the events of the past stating that they remain jaded towards the Fallen and towards the Cabal.

Just got to give props to the story team because these discussions(though they do seem like arguments that times) are definitely thought-provoking.

Thanks all, and sorry for my war mongering Titan thoughts. Haha."
1,Eyes of Tomorrow Still Without Its Intended Buff,"Eyes of Tomorrow was slated to have a buff at the start of season 13 however we did not get that, quite the opposite which was a ""stealth nerf"" that Bungie came out and said this was unintended and is in fact a bug. We are a month and some change into S13 and it has still not been addressed. I was hoping with the fix to Dunemarchers, Bungie would have also added in that Eyes did receive its buff.  


I am assuming Bungie is afraid of this exotic overperforming in certain areas of the game so they are just playing the field a little and must be seeing if there even needs to be a change. Here's hoping we hear something about it soon. I really liked the idea of Bungie bringing back raid exotics that aren't tied to a quest but Eyes is so underwhelming in endgame content that when I hear some of my clan mates talk about how they still have not got one after 30-40+ clears I can't help but be sorry. One for their terrible RNG but two once they acquire this rocket it is not in the best of positions compared to other options that aren't exotic to boot."
1,Looking for ideas for a stasis titan build for grandmaster,Title says it all.
1,The Challenger's Proving Quests feel like waiting a week for a new episode of a tv show and I really like that.,"So I'm here to be the 777th person the suck off the seasonal story telling, it's great. It keeps me coming back every week to learn more developments. I'd compare it to any weekly tv show, which more and more people are being exposed to thanks to shows like The Mandalorian and Wandavision. It's a cool feeling and every week brings in something substantial, as if time is passing and I'm experiencing it in game.

 I'm seeing the events happen as they unfold and come around to see the results of them. It's not just text in a quest telling me what happened, it's not lore, I'm experiencing it all first hand as it happens, and it's fantastic. Great stuff Bungie, can't wait to see how this style evolves."
1,Trials of Osiris......the solution,"Okay trials is in and abysmal state at the moment... You know it, I know it everybody knows it.

But here is an option that may fix some of the problems....

Okay a majority of trials matches consist of every player running up and using a sword or an emote to peek around corners and then it becomes a stalemate we're both teams wait for the other one to push and then they proceed to eradicate the other team with one hit kill weapons (shotguns,snipers...etc)..

However if you put heavy on a timer and (don't freak out).. special on a timer that would force each team not only to use primary weapon battles... But it would also force them to strategize a way to rotate and secure special ammo to the player that it would be most beneficial....(I have a friend of mine who is a much better sniper than I am so it would be a logical situation for them to pull special ammo for the sniper)..

Now what a lot of players also do is they hang back in the back of the map and wait for their super to build.. well that's a fine strategy if that's the way you want to play however in what I'm about to propose that will eliminate that entire situation.... Place a rift that's on a timer and only one player can get the rift which instantly charges the super.. now keep in mind these are just options these are options that would slow down play but it would force engagement with primary weapons...

Now game type:
What is stated above would fit into team deathmatch(first to 50),.

Now the timers and everything would have to be adjusted for capture the flag (instead of capture the flag capture the rift. With the same basic CTF rules)..

Oddball: basically a big game of keep away the longer you have the rift the more points you accumulate.

Elimination: current timers and rules apply
(For this game mode elimination is pretty much spot on)

Control. Control is pretty solid... The only thing that I would do is change the special ammo to put that on a timer and rifts (insta-supers) as a one-time charge about three quarters of the way through the match...

And LOOT!!!!!!
HAVE TWO POOLS OF LOOT

THE FIRST POOL OF LOOT IS FOR JUST PLAYING THE GAME KIND OF LIKE HOW INFAMY AND VALOR ALL WORK.. THE MORE YOU PROGRESS THE MORE DIFFERENT  KINDS OF LOOT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET.... Keep it simple old trials armor stuff that you would normally find in regular PVP playlist....

THEN THE SECOND LOOT POOL:
THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO GET LOOT FROM... HIGH STAT ROLL ARMOR OR A UMBRAL ENGRAM THAT IS FREE FOR YOU TO FOCUS. ON WHATEVER STAT THAT YOU NEED...


IN A NUTSHELL TRIALS NEEDS AN ENEMA..... IT NEEDS A GOOD SOLID CLEANING.. AND KEEP IN MIND I'M NOT SAYING THAT ALL THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE DIRECTLY TO A TEE .....EXACTLY HOW I SAY IT.. BUT THIS IS AN OPTION THAT COULD FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT'S PLAGUING TRIALS AND COMPETITIVE .......ACTUALLY PVP IN GENERAL

I JUST REALLY LIKE THIS GAME AND I PLAYED COMPETITIVE HALO FOR YEARS GROWING UP WATCHING IT ON TV AND ON STREAMS... ACTUALLY GETTING GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY AGAINST SOME OF THE BEST.. WASHY, THE OGRES (1&amp;2), LUNCH BOX,ROY, GANDHI.... I CAN GO ON AND ON..

IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IN REGARDS TO THE PLAYLISTS AND HOW THE GAME ACTUALLY PLAYS... PLAY THE MASTER CHIEF COLLECTION... OR FIRE UP THE OLD XBOX 360 LOAD UP HALO 2 OR HALO 3..

SORRY ABOUT THE WALL-O-TEXT GUYS... I JUST FEEL DESTINY PVP NEEDS A FRESH SET OF EYES.... HAD A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING..

A CONCERNED GUARDIAN"
1,Reintroduce Luna's Howl &amp; Not Forgotten,"I have three ideas

&amp;#x200B;

1. Reintroduce both weapons back to how they was in the glory days that includes RPM and how the perks used to function
2. Reintroduce both weapons but make one a 120RPM archetype rework Magnificent Howl and give both an Adept version to grind for
3. Merge both guns into one some names I think of are ""Luna's Not forgotten"" or ""Magnificent Howl"" (Wow so creative) make it a 120RPM archetype Magnificient Howl perk is reworked my idea is rapidly landing 2 headshots increases range &amp; RPM to 180 for a short duration the weapon would be earned via a choice of content you prefer to run (Like Salvager's Salvo) will also have 3 Ornaments to grind for from Strikes, Crucible, Gambit all Ornaments could have a little Doggo design that is always glowing and when Magnificent Howl perk is activated you hear  Howling (Wind? :D)"
1,Can we talk about how The Fourth Mark ship doesnt drop?,Its been 14 weeks Bungie. Please.
1,Do you get anything for completing all the weekly seasonal challenges?,Is there a seal or anything associated with it other than the large bright dust pile?
1,Can Bungie add Powerful Friends back into Banshee's mod pool?,"I remember the day that Banshee sold Powerful Friends, I was on a family trip, I was so upset to hear I missed Powerful Friends. But this isn't just about me, so many other guardians missed that mod and having it back would please many players. The main reason Bungie should put it back into his pool is Powerful Friends is a great mod that is used in many builds and I already have an idea of my build. but I've check Banshee every day since he sold Powerful Friends and guess what! Nope.

Anyway, let me hear your thoughts/opinions down below!

Thanks,

1,Vanguard dare cloak,"Just watched the lore video by Byf on Andal and the vanguard dare cloak. Always wanted to pay homage to Cayde which is why I really want this cuz when a hunter takes the cloak of a dead comrade, this is a vow.

So can I still get it or is it unacquirable like the black armory shaders?"

1,I got a question.,"So I completed the corrupted omelette triumph and I did not get the sparrow, is it not obtainable anymore or is this a bug ?"
1,I have so many questions,"I don't understand how this happens but i'll say... I was playing comp and it was my last game before unbroken (i got it btw the game after) and this happened multiple times. The map, pantheon/convergence and I spawned next to the whole team twice in a row. the first time I traded and my teammates killed the other two and I spawned next to them and got insta-killed. It lost us the game and im sick of that happening. Idk why that happens when my team is on a safe part of the map. Like why not spawn me there? my fault? has anyone else experienced this?"

Is there a bug where people don’t get all their spoils because almost every encounter i only received a piece of gear that usually had a bad roll!

I’m just trying to get more spoils to buy Anarchy since i took a few years off the game and missed out on it when it was available.

Please let me know if this is happening to other people :)"
1,Xbox One X HDR broke?,Was fine yesterday. Loaded it up today and it's not working for some reason.
1,Cayde-6.,"What can a more interesting title than that? Lol. Cayde-6 is probably the biggest click-bait for us guardians. We devour every little gossip or discussion about him no matter how small. OK to the point.

I do not know if there is a thread for this exact discussion or something very similar and sorry I didn't look for it. We all might have accepted that Bungie has made it clear Cayde isn't coming back. Did they say it? Or have they somehow very indirectly implied that there is an almost certain chance of him not coming back? But let me just say, Uldren Sov. 

Why is he back? I know he has been back for over 4 months so why am I discussing this now, bit slow on the realisation there. And if anything is true the fact that he now has a conscience is something we cannot deny. What will happen when he is truly unmasked? What will happen when he realises just what he has taken from us? Taken!! I don't think remorse is an emotion to be taken lightly. Why did the traveller bring him back? Will he do anything possible in his power to bring back Cayde?

I know I sound like a cultist devoted to bringing back Cayde-6. But if lightfall is coming then what better way to prevent it than a reunited vanguard? What better way to tether us to light than an old friend? But then again Uldren Sov can always turn to darkness on his path to Cayde and everything will fall apart. And if the voice actor of Cayde doesn't want his old job back, everything will fall apart too."
1,Looking for a killer PvE Le Monarque build for my Warlock!,"I want to rip through the Legendary Lost Sector tomorrow night for the warlock exotic chest piece this season, and I keep hearing great things about the La Monarque, which I already have.

1,Meet me in the middle; crowdsourcing light sub-class buffs to help them catch up with stasis.,"We might as well crowdsource it before Bungie comes out with X subclass has an increase to its damage resistence while frozen.

\- top tree arcstrider, inherent double charges to its dodge ability;

\- casting titan bubble immediately cancels all stasis effects within its area of effect, all allies inside are completely imune to stasis while they remain in the bubble;

\- well of radiance, same as the titan bubble; 

What do you guys suggest?"
1,"I think it's an outrage that after 7 years of Destiny, we still don't have Cabal subclasses. Here are my concepts","Titan: Ballbreaker

•tank

•Activating your super turns you red and scaly and you chase after people with swords

Warlock: Ballbender

•nerd

•Both of your eyes fuse into one and you can create purple earthquakes that shoot people in the air

Hunter: Ballstalker

•scrawny

•Activating your super lets you call in a Cabal Thresher that drops Caballs on people"

1,Adept big ones shouldn’t be a Adept mod,"Sure the mod is great, but the amount of PvE weapons we have that would actually benefit from this mod is slim to none. This mod should simply just be named big ones and become socket-able into any weapon we want.

Keep the method to obtain it though, gives another reason to farm GMs."
1,Tell me your LoadOut - GM Devils Lair,"Figure i start a post to see what people are running.

Did my first GM this season last night ... Wow is that a ton of enemies ....

Here are my thoughts after the run and talking to clan mates

Weapon Loads

* Primary - Sniper 
* Energy - Bow (Arc/Void/Solar)
* Heavy - Anarchy , Arc Machine Gun , Void Rocket / Machine Gun

Armor Load Out Mods

* Helmet - Sniper and Heavy Finder Mods
* Arms - Anti Barrier Sniper , Overload Bows
* Chest - Sniper Resistance , Concussion Resistance
* Legs - Sniper and Heavy Specific Scrounger Mods
* Class Item - High Energy Fire / Shelter from the Void 

Notes

* Of course titan running Ursa and warlock running well do great in 1st and final boss room
* anarchy is great for 2nd area to take out the tank that caused the most wipes 
* Most other mods slots in armor where used for Charge with Light and raising Recovery or Resistance Stats to some level

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see what other people like to run and happy hunting getting Adept stuff in GM"
1,Catalyst Brainstorming,"Lets brainstorm some catalyst ideas for Bungie

At this point I think all exotic weapons should have an earnable catalyst for two reasons; orb generation and kill tracker. Orbs are super important in PvE &amp; PvP and kill trackers are important for my ego. I think it’s time we help Bungie out and brainstorm some catalyst perks for weapons, ideally it wouldn’t be anything crazy or game breaking but do what you want, go wild. 

I’ll go first: give Chaperone Icarus grip"
1,Captain's Log lore pages,"I haven't done presage in a few weeks, and as a result, I only have 1/12 of the pages so far. I need all 12 pages to get the seal this season, and wanted to know if only one page is given out each week, or can I get the last few weeks of more pages this week since I missed them?"
1,Can we get a kill tracker on blue (Rare) guns?,For the lolz. There's some Blue weapons I love using in Crucible and would at least like a kill tracker.
1,I’m no longer trying in Destiny’s PVP gamemodes. They can’t make me.,"Stasis in PVP is a mistake. A marketing move gone wrong. Bungie advertised Stasis as the next big thing in the game, and had to deliver on big. The result was the most unbalanced, unfun, and unimaginably frustrating thing to ever grace this PVP. Worse than pre-nerf one eyed mask. Worse than handheld supernova. Worse than a hunter with infinite spectral blades. 

There is simply nothing fun about not being able to fight back. Nothing at all. You can spam click the escape key all you want, but unless there’s a teammate nearby to clean up the attacker, you’re as good as dead. 

Stasis is just one head of the unholy Cerberus that plagues the PVP. An absolutely abysmal matchmaking system causes more than half of my PVP games to end with a mercy, with either my team slapping, or being slapped. The weapon meta is so strict that if you don’t follow it, you will lose. The number of one-hit-kill mechanics in this game make so many fights hit first or die first. 

As far as I’m concerned, aside from the weekly PvP games for the pinnacle, Destiny does not HAVE a PvP game mode. It simply does not exist. They can’t make me care about it, no matter how many quest steps require it."
1,NightFall Strike Bug,"So ever since like i think in the morning to now at 5 pm whenever i load into the Sepiks Prime nightfall strike there are either no enemies or the enemies are bugged and dont attack and killing them just instant respawns them, they are also not as many as there should be. I have verified files on steam and restarted the game multiple times."
1,Gilded Conqueror - 11 GM completions to flex the title for 3 weeks.,"This is really disappointing. I have no issues right now with the requirements it's just really disappointing that you can only use the ""Gilded"" title for 3 weeks before it goes out. This is in contrast with all other gilded titles (Unbroken, Flawless, Dredgen)My suggestion is  Bungie should at least extend it's duration until next season's GM's are available or, make GM's be available earlier in the season to allow us to earn this much more earlier."
1,"So in the lore tab for The Swarm, recently released, Shaw Han does something new.","Re-posting to avoid spoiler in title.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-swarm

So in the new lore tab of The Swarm, Shaw Han and a couple Redjacks are defending a front in the Cosmodrome against an influx of Cabal.  Saladin shows up and helps him and the frames rally and push back.  Shaw Han then looks like he's about to cast another Golden Gun, but does something completely and totally new.

&gt;He pushes the bulk of his Light into his weapon, spreads its influence to reach the nearby Redjacks, and reignites his gun before touching the barrel to the ground and firing. The ground bubbles with hot magmatic Light; a warmth envelops the Redjacks as Solar flame imbues and empowers their rifles with golden power. Shaw directs the firestorm of golden Redjack rifles to incinerate every last charging foe. 

It's almost like he cast a Golden Gun style Well of Radiance, but for the Redjacks.  Has anyone been able to imbue their Light into other objects like this?  I was thinking that it maybe could also be a preview at a future support based Solar Hunter class?  Either way I don't think we've ever seen someone do something as different as Shaw Han just did though."
1,I refuse to accept Crow as the Hunter Vanguard,"Ikora shall remain the Vanguard member with the longest hair, I will not be moved on this motion!"
1,I have an Idea: A Pinnacle Focus System,"Right, Everyone had that time where you were just needing that one pinnacle reward... and you don't get it to drop at all that week. It leaves you feeling irritated, your effort gone to waste... So I decided to think of a way to fix this.

#Introducing The Pinnacle Focusing System!#

The first change made by the introduction by this system would be that you would no longer recieve an item drop from completing a weekly pinnacle challenge but instead, You would be rewarded a Pinnacle Engram that would drop loot from said activities loot pool, excluding raids, dungeons and Trials.

These Pinnacle Engrams that are rewarded can be taken to the H.E.L.M and focused using the prismatic recaster on a separate page. (The Teir 3 Umbral Focusing options would be brought back to the first one, don't know why Bungie moved it in the first place.)

This second page would contain 4 rows of Focusing Options and a third page would be created to store two more for Prime Engrams: 

• 2 for focusing Pinnacle Engrams, with one row for weapons and one row for armour.

and

• 2 for focusing Powerful Engrams, once again one row for weapons and one row for armour

On the third page you would find 2 rows, again One for weapons and one for armour.


#On the weapons row you would have the following options:#
------------- Tier 1 -------------
• An Engram that guarantees a Weapon
------------- Tier 2 --‐----------
• An Engram that guarantees a Primary Weapon

• An Engram that guarantees an Energy Weapon

• An Engram that guarantees a Heavy Weapon

• An Engram that guarantees an Auto Rifle or a Pulse Rifle *

• An Engram that guarantees a Sniper Rifle or a Scout Rifle *

• An Engram that guarantees a Hand Cannon or a Sidearm *

• An Engram that guarantees an SMG or a Bow *

• An engram that guarantees a shotgun or Fusion Rifle *

• An Engram that guarantees either a Heavy or Special Grenade Launcher *

• An Engram that Guarantees a Rocket Launcher, A Machine Gun or a Sword. *
--------------- Tier 3 ------------------
• All the above options (Excluding Tier 1) but you can select either the first or second perk and the weapon drops masterworked.

(*: This option is only available if such activity has said weapon type in their loot pool.)

On the Armour row you would have the following option: 
---------------- Tier 1 ------------------
• An Engram that guarantees an Armour Piece
‐-----‐--------- Tier 2 ------------------
• An Engram that guarantees a Helmet

• An Engram that guarantees Gauntlets

• An Engram that guarantees a Chest Piece
 
• An Engram that guarantees a Leg Piece

• An Engram that guarantees a Class Item
----------------- Tier 3 ---------------
• All the above options (Excluding Random Armour)   but with high stat roll options for each.

#The Cost:#

To Focus these engrams, you would be required to obtain a Sigil of Service. This would be obtained through doing pinnacle challenges (One for each challenge), but if you want to obtain more they will have a chance to drop from activities like Raids, Nightfalls, Trials, Iron Banner, Ect with the chance to obtain one getting higher everytime it doesn't drop.

The price of the focus will be dependant on its tier:

Tier One drops are the most basic form of focusing and will only cost 20 legendary shards and one Sigil of Service.

Tier Two drops are more focused to a specific type of item and will be a bit more expensive, costing 50 legendary shards and 2 Sigils of Service.

Tier Three drops are some of the best options you can choose if your looking for god roll gear so they will be the most costly, requiring 100 legendary shards and 3 Sigils of Service.

#Connecting the H.E.L.M and The Tower#
I understand how mildly annoying it can be to have to go to the H.E.L.M to decrypt and Focus your Umbral Engrams but then have to load into the Tower to decrypt a Prime Engram with Rahool. So I would introduce a change where both the Umbral Decoder and Rahool can decrypt Prime Engrams. This removes a part of the problem when it comes to decoding your engrams while also keeping the purpose of both The H.E.L.M (The only place you can Decrypt Umbrals and Focus important Engrams) and The Tower (The only place to speak to Playlist Vendors such as Lord Shaxx, Commander Zavala and the Gunsmith Banshee-44) and to make it easier and (possibly) quicker to access, A banner would be placed near the hanger entrance that will allow you to load into the H.E.L.M and Vice Versa, In the H.E.L.M there would be a banner next to the door nearest the decoder that allows you to load into the Tower.

#Concluding Note#

Thank you for spending your time to read this. I'm not the best at coming up with shit like this so if you have anything to say, Maybe some criticism or an addition to the post, leave a comment. Just please remember that this is just a little idea I've had, so kindly don't spout any insults at me like I've just sunset your Ikelos SMG, Thanks. :)"
1,Trials of the Nine shader?,"My friend said he got the shader a few weeks ago just doing some activities, and I wanted to ask if it's still available and how to get it?"
1,"Suggestion for a new power leveling system, respects player time, feels natural and makes RNG feels less puniching","To put into perspective what the Power leveling system should become, we have to adress the issues of it current iterration

1. The Leveling system RN feels restrictive, both in its weekly lockout format

2. Leveling time commtment is RN better measured in how many weeks it took U to get there, not how many hours U spent playing the game

3. RNG is the biggest defactor of the current system

4. Leveling can be done anywhere by doing anything, requiring nothing of the player, and creating no progression

5. Higher level activities have basically no difference in leveling compared to other Easier PvE activities... In other words, the harder does not mean the better

How Can we adree this and acomplish what I set out to do when I wrote ths tittle

1. ***THE MOST IMPORTANT*** Remove the weekly lockout on THE POWERFUL grind

This change by itself makes no sense... But after I breakdown more changes It will make sense

2. Weekly Challenges are removed from the power leveling grind, and are reserved for ONLY pinnacle level grind. The powerful Level Grind is set as a 100 power level grind. ***I.e soft cap 1250 ---&gt; powerful cap 1350.***

3. Activities now reward powerful level loot based on the activities level, dropping a certain ammount of loot depending on activity 

• If the player's gear level is under the level of the activity the loot will drop as a +2

• If the player's gear level is higher compared to the activities level, then Loot will drop as a +1, upt to 20 levels above the activities power level

• example: 1310 level Ordeal.
▪︎Player Level 1250 (soft cap) ---&gt; 1309 - Loot on the end chest drops +2
▪︎Player Level 1310 ---&gt; 1330 - Loot drops as a +1
▪︎ Player Level 1331+ - Doesnt drop poweful, gear drops as +0

4. Loot now drops based on the Slots power level, not the players overall gear level. Prime engrams drop as +3 based on Slots level

5. Activities would display not only the range of their drops power level (I.e a level 1300 strike would Display: **""1310 max level rewards""**). Activities would also display the range of The ammount of rewards the activity can drop (strikes: ""2-3""; Crucible: ""1-2"", Gambit: ""2-3"")

6. Crucible based activities would have a Wider range of power levels.
• Casual: 1250 (soft cap) ---&gt; 1310 (will only offer +1 drops)
• Comp: 1310 ----&gt; 1350 (offering +1 drops)
• Iron Banner and trials can droo up to 1350 (+2 Drops)

7. Gambit will have a similar distribution to crucible, dropping +1 rewards as loot

8. Pinnacle loot drops would be the only ones to have weekly challenges associated with them, and weekly lockouts... But would still work by Slot leveling increases. Item's power is based on the the highest level of gear on that slot not overall powerlevel, Resulting in a more consistent Pinaccle leveling experience (also Maybe bad luck protection for slots already at the pinnacle cap)


***RESULTS***

This is all speculative,but a system like this is likely to create a better feeling leveling system, since it feels more like U are spending Time in the game and getting rewarded, rather than filling a golden achivement and waiting for the next week

Having the powerful grind also be in a range of 100 levels guarantees that it will still require upwards to 20 ish hours to level up a charecter... Note that this 100 power increase would only be aplued to Major expansion, seasons can very well maintain the +10 each season pinnacle grind

The way that the loot range of drops is set up allows players to play underleveld activities for higher power increases per Drop (the harder activity the better). 

Also using ordeal as a baseline, allows Bungie to create different levels of activities to reward different ranges of loot due to power gaps...

Example:

1310 hero level ordeal:
• Drops loot up to 1320 level

The next level of ordeal, Legend, would be set at the power level 1350 (power cap)... Most players leaving the Hero level ordeal will be at 1320 power level

This means there is a Big cap in level there...

This can be filled up by other PvE activities added in an expantion, or even the Expansion relative Seasonal activity, or even a Blind well type activity... Either that or by increasing artifacts powerlevel for an easier time at underleveled activities

This is the core of the system, a Non restricitive constant grind that asks for time commitment, rather than weekly chores

1,Guardian Game game modes improvement and or ideas for a game mode,"Hello I’m here today to discuss potential ways of making Guardian Games a lot more fun like bringing back game modes like sparrow racing or RIFT because that would make the game event EVEN better then it was before because let’s be honest (guardian games last year was boring af) but if you had event based game modes for it people would love it even more, I think the strike where you can only get paired with certain guardians is a good step in the right direction but game modes would make the event far far FAR Bette, Imo or come up with a new one I actually have an idea for a game mode where you can fight against other guardians it’s in an arena where it splits three ways one Titan one Warlock one Hunter and it introduces each team in threes (similar to trials) you have to kill the other teams to gain points and then an orb randomly spawns in and  you have to grab the orb somewhere on the map and try to protect the person holding it but when they get enough energy they have to deposit it into the middle of a map where then the team with the energy deposited has there supers for a very short time to attack and fight back which also gives the team a few extra points for depositing anyways what do you guys think? Comment below"
1,Update 3.1.1 crashes my PS5,"Hi all, hoping someone may have a fix for this problem. 

Since the update when I load destiny 2 and select my character the screen goes black and then I get an error report to send to Sony.

I've since discovered if I leave the character select screen for 20 seconds and then select my character it seems fine.

However only I seem to be suffering this bug, no one else in my clan?

I know the work around is leave it for 20 seconds, but why is this only affecting me?"
1,A new player's perspective (Started playing Jan. 25),"Good:

________________________

 - As an artist, first of all, i'd like to say Destiny 2 is probably the most visually beautiful game i've ever played, and is my favorite thing about the game in general. Dreaming City definitely stands out as my favorite location, and i'm usually roaming around there when i have nothing else to do. I've spent many hours literally just *looking* at the game instead of playing it

- Exploration in this game for the first ~3 weeks is pretty mesmerizing, it's around that time when you don't know what to google to find everything out so you actually have to physically go places to find out, and even after that, after you found light.gg and raidsecrets and the wikis and you think you've pretty much discovered everything, you STILL find new things and new ways to play

- Loot in this game is great, I come from a wildly different loot-based flash game from 2010 called Realm of the mad god, and that game is pretty notorious for having an amazing feeling when you get some super rare item. Destiny 2 has even more than that, exotics and legendaries can both be just as exciting to get, even far into the endgame, it took me like 2 weeks to even find out about ritual weapons, playlist weapons, dreaming city weapons, etc. Finishing a build and testing it out is one of the most satisfying things this game can offer

- Free game. Lot of people on reddit and twitter like to say d2 is now a ""free trial"" after BL removed all those old locations and questlines, but i couldn't disagree more. As a player who never plans on spending money on this game, this is absolutely a full game. The only thing i'm missing out on is the bottom row of the season pass, some nice exotics and legendaries, some quests, most of all though, raids. Everything else is completely free. 

- Story is cool.

- Sense of companionship in all PVE content is great, synergy between not only my items but all my team's items and class works so well that you REALLY notice when you're solo. Raids are probably an even better example of this, but i haven't experienced that and don't plan on it until VoG

- Items, especially exotics, can have so much personality behind them at times. Whether it's just a rare item that you were lucky enough to get, or some quest reward that has an entire story behind it, some items you just feel a lot of weight behind when you finally get them in your inventory

- Replayability is pretty much infinite in this game, as it's a grinding loot-based game. Even if you've hit the very top echelon of your builds on all 3 characters, completed everything you can complete (which still i haven't even yet), you can always either start over on a new path, or continue grinding for the littlest optimizations, which isn't unsatisfying in this gam e to me at all

- Sense of scale. This is probably another thing that was even better pre-BL, but this game feels absolutely massive, driving through all the different worlds, taking on armies, fighting gods, etc. The Prophecy dungeon is the greatest example of this, my first run of it was absolutely insane, it's like dropping into the entire fourth dimension with nothing but 3 little weapons and a sparrow


________________________

Bad:

________________________

- Fanbase is distinctly worse than any other ""bad fanbase"" i've seen or been in, probably due to how old the two games are. Games with mostly ""veteran"" fanbases are usually absolutely terrible, it's always either endless defense of the creators (if some of these people could get paid to say ""stop complaining"", they'd be worth more than Bungie itself) or toxicity towards new players, infighting, just general meathead brain

- Terrible gameplay decisions across the board, unbearably obvious p2w marketing in PVP (""oops we made stasis extremely powerful in PVP and near un-counterable! the only counter is paying $40 to get it yourself""). Balancing in PVE is pretty good generally, but every once in a while you'll read the latest patch notes and find out a part of your build has been either deleted or reduced by 100,000 damage and lasts for 0.01 seconds instead of the previous 4 seconds


- Inconsistency and bugs is a problem with this game like i've never seen before with any other game. With a game of this scale, there are *so many* random bugs and inconsistent mechanics that you can have something go wrong, look up the issue, and find a 2-year-old thread talking about it 90% of the time. This can also be a good thing sometimes, as it adds some spice (cheeses, 12 man activities, OOBs are super fun to hunt, etc) but other than that it's almost unbearable

- Physics in this game (movement, velocity, fall/impact damage, character and enemy animations) are pretty horrible and inconsistent sometimes. Getting around by foot and by sparrow can be *extremely* annoying sometimes. You're going to die many times from stubbing your toe, falling one meter, getting sent into the fourth dimension by a Phalanx shield bash, etc. The AI being barebones combined with the fact that some enemy factions have animations that completely cover their crit spot makes for some really annoying gameplay. Don't get me started about Vex crit spots specifically

1,Make Adept Weapons Their Own Loot Tier,"Whether they become red, black, orange, cyan, whatever. Give them that next step to make them truly special.

The current system of appending (Adept) onto the end of existing legendaries *works*, though as we move into the future with more adept weapons being added to the loot pool (yearly with Trials refreshes, potentially seasonal with GM refreshes, and soon from Master Raids as discussed in State of the Game) the game may reach a position where the (Adept) tag is attached to just about every legendary in the game in the meta, and at that point non-Adept legendaries would essentially feel like how blues do now. This suggestion doesn't solve that problem at all, if anything it exacerbates it, but it'd sure be cool, right?"
1,No pinnacle drop,Hey bungie if your gonna put me though the flaming dumpster fire that is crucible at least give me my pinnacle drop

1,A guardian that needs help!,"Hello fellow guardians! 
First of all sorry for the format, im posting from my phone.

I haven’t played destiny since 2015 when I moved away from home and life changed a lot. But i always remember how happy this game made me back then.
Right now im fighting with depression and anxiety and because of covid im locked down alone and remembering how happy this game made me makes me think that it would be a great help for my now.
So i just went on the PS store and found out is a free to play game now . So I just started downloading and cant wait to see my guardian again. 
However i don’t have no one to play with and here is where i need your help guardians.

If any of you would like to take an old guardian thats been asleep for 5 years and show him whats has changed in the solar system since I’ve been gone please comment here or send me a PM. 

I would really appreciate it.

Thank you all guardians!"

1,Ghost Missing,Anyone had an issue of their equipped ghost going missing after the recent update? I used to have the warlock shell equipped (the one with the bird) got on today and the snake one was equipped. Searched my vault and other characters and it’s gone. I know I didn’t do anything with it because I never even mess with my ghost shell.
1,Text chat not working/showing up.,I’ve come across an issue where I type something into chat and it doesn’t appear in the chat box. I can’t see anything anyone else in the fire team has typed either. Is there a fix?
1,[Spoiler] So did Shaw Han basically just cast a Golden Gun mobile Well of Radiance in the newly released lore tab for The Swarm?,"&gt;!https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-swarm

In this lore tab, Shaw Han is barely defending his front along with a couple Redjacks, when Saladin shows up and rallies them to push forward. Shaw Han then pushes his Light into his gun like he's casting another Golden Gun, but he empowers the frames around him, then shoves barrel of his gun into the ground and Lights up the weapons of the frames around him with Solar fire and begins his push.

Well... This is completely and totally new? Does anyone think this might be a preview into a future variation of Golden Gun perhaps? Nothing like this game changing has ever been done before with any other subclass as far as I'm aware?!&lt;"
1,Problem with text chat after the update,"So, I logged onto destiny earlier this morning and for some reason the text chat doesnt work. I can open the window and type there but nothing shows up, this happens with the local/team/fireteam chat although with the local chat, I was able to type whilst I was in the Tower.  
This has nothing to do with the typical ""steam servers are down"" message because it's all working fine and I haven't got any of these messages. I went on the LFG discord server and some other ppl are having the same problem. It's kind of hard to comunicate with your fireteam without... well, being able to actually communicate.  


Is anyone else experiencing this problem?"
1,destiny not allowing me to connect to their servers.,"it keeps giving the error codes related to general networking issues, but my wifi is fine, and I'm on an open nat, it was working fine a few days ago, and recently has it started to disconnect me a lot, is there any way to fix this?"
1,So are we gonna address the elephant in the room about GM Nightfalls?,"Mods are gatekeeping this activity. Every single youtube video about a guide or load out has Protective Light, Stacks on Stacks, High Energy Fire, and Harvester. I think we can all agree Protective Light is the outlier here. Everything can 1 shot in GM's but with this mod you have time react after taking a hit and not dieing instantly. This is critical teambase strategy here. Staying alive is the best thing so why keep this mod from everyone who doesnt have it? I dont care if it cost 5 Ascended Shards at Banshee's but the last time he sold the mod was 3 months ago... A whole season ago?! Like Bungo you just killed Sunseting you have returning players make these mods accessible to the people who have done the grind for light level prepared the gear maxed out the stats by farming the armor for weeks to get those high stats. Farmed the Ascended shards to max out multiple armor pieces for the GM only to tell them sorry you wernt logged in on this specific day 3 months ago... I get it you dont need the mod but if your whole fire team doesnt have these mods its gonna be extremely difficult to do this GM."

[https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/524856635](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/524856635)

Takes a little practice to get the jumps, warlocks and titans should have no troubles.

Use the slopes of the rocks to throw yourself upwards with momentum.

100 Mobility with Stomp335

No sword ammo and no  stasis grenades, which would obviously make that high jump MUCH easier, so this is probably the hardest way to do this section. Defs use these to get you through, only 2 hard-ish jumps and youre free to get through the whole section.

Sorry if someone else has posted something similar."
1,So how time consuming is destiny han you play it like borderlands?,"Now i wonder can you play destiny like singel player borderlands 1/2? I really dont wanna play Another time sink game im taking a long break from league of legends cause how much time that games demands and with tbh almost zero rewards for the player really dont like league anymore. So is destiny anything like league?

Also if i dont sink my time into destiny i Will just miss content correct? I heard they removed all old content even the story that sounds beyond stupid so all content got a time limit now? Even paid dlc?"
1,Gilded Conqueror is a joke.,Why is the Gilded requirement doing all 6 Gms. Thats the regular Conqueror we did for the past seasons. Why will we get it 4weeks or so before the season ends and title reset happens. Every other guilded title can be grinded out within the first week of a season to show of that u are dedicated to a certain activity only conqueror is a joke.

PVE had glowing halos for completing Prestige Raids or Nightfalls. Why not bring these back for Grandmaster Nightfalls. Equipping the Elmblem of the Strike (yes, we need new ones for the new strikes) to active or deactive it.

But also the PVE community wants to show their weekly achievements.

1,300 crucible wins/nightfall completions is way too much to unlock witherhoard's catalyst.,"Title. 

I picked up witherhoard from the kiosk recently because i've heard its a good weapon and I wanted to try it out. However, when i got to the catalyst unlock, i realised i needed to do a ridiculous amount of activities to unlock it.

I don't want to make destiny my day job, night shift and Sunday school in order to unlock one catalyst that will improve a weapon which i have already spent a lot of time farming materials to get. What's worse is that the season pass catalyst boost doesnt work for previous seasons' weapons.

Either make the season pass catalyst boost work with previous weapons or reduce the amount in general, because I don't want to spend 8-10 mintues per crucible game 300 times to unlock this.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
1,Pinnacle gear vs. Prime engrams,"Just a question about how pinnacle gear works. Is it added to your inventory as a decryptable engram like prime/exotic gear is, or more like picking up a legendary on the ground is?

Something weird was that while I was fighting Sepiks Prime in devils lair, the strike suddenly completed while Sepiks was still alive. The boss was not moving, though I could still attack him. 

However, today, after the update, I've had disconnects every other crucible game and disconnects in strikes. The error code is always different(weasel, bird, baboon etc). First I get booted from altars/strike queue for baboon, then i get booted to title for weasel.

Also if this helps, I use a USB3.0 to RJ45 adapter for my internet and my device is a laptop which I have to run at 30% graphics for D2 for it to run at at least 30fps.

I genuinely can't tell who's out of the loop, Bungie or my clan. Does anybody else feel this way with the way the Weekly Challenges and stuff are set up?"
1,1325 Power Level for GMs ISN'T Gatekeeping!,"Seen a lot of very upset folks on Twitter who want to be able to run GMs but arent at the 1325 power gate yet. Just a few thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

* Just like at the start of BL, a lot of people knew that GMs would drop 16th March and started levelling in order to be at max power by this point. They raided 3+ times per week across three toons. They minmaxed power and pinnacle drops to maxmise their chances of success. They completed every weekly challenge, even if the thought of playing comp makes their piss boil. It's a grind that needed to start at the beginning of the season, and if you didn't do it, that's fine, just understand that some people did and GMs at 1325 power are for *those* people right now.
* Use the time between now and hitting 1325 to find a reliable fireteam. You'll need one. Run Master Nightfalls. Run them some more, using different toons. Learn callouts, practice your comms and being able to focus fire on the Champions.
* Get ready to dedicate a few nights - when you hit 1325 - to getting it done the first time. Work out what your best team loadout is, and believe.
* Remember that being able to COMPLETE the GM is not about your light level. GMs are HARD. Luck is involved, and even the best people wipe because Fallen Snipers are greasy little shits.
* GMs are the Trials of PvE. They are PINNACLE activities. I don't mess with Trials because I am not good enough and I dont have a team. Take the same attitude to GMs.
* The season is long. You'll get there.

This isnt meant to be a negative post; completing my first ever GM (at the end of last season) was one of my most memorable D2 experiences. I had a regular firetime, we practiced, we got there in the end. 

Good luck out there!"
1,Harbinger feather bugged,"Not all feathers are spawning this week. Again.

1,Cosmetic idea,"I would love to see a cosmetic armor set for each class that was animated in some way. Like maybe a set that put off different effects when you run depending on you subclass (solar= on fire, void= radiating purple light, arc= electric clouds). I highly doubt this would ever happen but still a cool concept."
1,"Bungie, when are you going to address the entirety of the unhappy warlock player base","Bungie has made it clear that warlocks are their least favorite subclass. Whenever warlocks get anything good, it's nerfed in a matter of days. Whereas Hunters and titans get to keep their power houses for months, sometimes even over a year without even mentioning it. Warlocks are unhappy and have been for years. We just want to know why. Why do warlocks get such unfair treatment compared to hunters and titans? Why do warlocks get constantly nerfed whenever we have anything good? We are forced into either well of radiance for pve or top tree dawnblade for pvp. And while they are fun classes and DONT NEED TO BE NERFED FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!! It's getting boring  be forced to play the same things over and over again. Please Bungo, just make an announcement as to why warlocks aren't treated equally"

1,Gambit is in an unacceptably bad state.,"Gambit is by far the worst game mode in Destiny. Not only is it beyond neglected, loot barren, and all around not fun to play with any less than 3 of your friends, but it is one of the most, if not THE MOST required game mode of the season. YOU CANNOT FORCE YOUR PLAYERS TO PLAY A GAMEMODE THAT IS TERRIBLE. There is no incentive to play this gamemode other than ""devs force us to for challenges"", there is no solo playlist so every game you go into by yourself is basically a guaranteed loss to a 4 stack. All of this is already awful, but when you add the fact that any coordinated team can chain invade with as much heavy as they want with the right mods, and team wipe a team of solo players every. fucking. game. And for some reason you don't get ANY infamy for losses, so to reach 5 rank ups, you not only have to play hours and hours of gambit, you have to WIN to get ANYTHING. It is downright unplayable. Bungie. For the sake of every players sanity. Stop making us play this awful gamemode without showing it some love."

1,Please consider adding Eyes of Tomorrow to the kiosk in the next Season,"This comes from a Guardian with 40 DSC clears without having the EoT to drop.

Please Bungie, consider waiting like 2 Seasons after a Raid releases and then put the Exo on Sale so other guardians like me can get the title (I imagine there are many guardians with only EoT missing for the Descendant title).

And/or make it a guaranteed drop on let's say your 50th clear at least.

Take e.g. Anarchy as an example for how it should be priced.

Most of my Clanmates - myself included - want to dive head first back into the Vault of Glass when it hits."

1,Will Fusion Rifles get Overload mods next season?,"Season 12, we had Unstoppable Shotguns. Season 13 has been Anti-Barrier Snipes. It stands to reason that 14 will probably have Overload Fusion Rifle mods. 

Im scared of that possibility. If they require you to land a full burst to overload a champ, that's gonna be pretty rough considering how often they teleport. 

Side note, I suppose its possible they do Overload Grenade launchers, but that might be even worse? Imagine trying to time that shot and the explosion from it while a Captain is zipping around."

1,Gambit is not getting the attention it needs from Bungie.,"Les maps then pre-Beyond light, barely any changes to keep the mode fresh and rewarding. 

It gets a little bit of attention because there’s a small minority that enjoy it and a massive chunk that just get it over with for the pinnacle drop. 

It would not hurt the game that much if it just ceased to exist next week. 

 Bungie just do something to it next season. Here’s a few suggestions to make it even slightly better:

1. Add a freelance gambit option 

2. Add new maps and weapons/armor that have gambit specific adept perks 

3. Add a mechanic so that teams need to bank motes into the portal to activate it instead of the bank. That way invading becomes more tactical then just a mechanic to help snowball. 

4. Move the drifter to the main floor of the Tower (seriously he doesn’t need to be way down in the Annex) 

5. Lower the number of points for an infamy rank up. 

6. Make it so that you lose half of your motes instead of all of them when you die."
1,Why do vendors sell sunset gear? Why is the game rewarding things with sunset gear at all?,"Why does Failsafe sell sunset gear? What is the purpose of that gear even appearing on screen and existing in the game? Not even a New Light player would benefit by getting them since playing for 20 minutes will reward you with gear that is at current level.

Why did Insight Terminus award a sunset Long Goodbye? Why couldn't it be a reworked newer version? 

These are just a couple examples. I just don't understand. If this is intentional, what is the purpose of this? If this isn't intentional, why isn't anything done about it? It just makes the game look so cheap and not looked after."
1,There goes my chances of getting that large pile of Bright Dust at the end of the season..,"Complete a Grandmaster Nightfall as one of the weekly Challenges? REALLY?

Yes I know Esoterrick has already solo'ed it flawlessly but we can't all be gods among men (and woman).

1,Earning combat style mods,"with how bungie has set up the current mod system, it is extremely difficult to unlock mods from seasons past.

bungie talked a lot about FoMO, and yet they have put an extremely tight filter on the flow of mods. making people have to wait upwards of a third of a year for a chance at a mod they missed (162 mods that banshee sells)

case an point, i saw a post a couple days ago talking about how since they couldn't get on D2 for ONE day they missed out on an awesome mod (wraith of Rasputin), 

and now unless bungie does some magic in the servers they will have to wait about 100 days on the low end for that mod to be purchasable again

Now im not saying bungie should just give people the mods, no im wanting a more streamline method to earn mods that people dont already have

^((i know they say ""earn rank up packages with the gunsmith"", however after about 4,000 weapon materials (did a vault clean), and i didnt get a SINGLE mod. if theres a chance it aint high enough))

what i believe would be a good alt method other then waiting for the one day the mod is sold to unlock it. add them to rewards pools of higher end activites;

what i mean specifically upon completing a legend/master lost sectors, empire hunts, nightfalls.

with the difficulty increasing the chance 1 will drop,

these drops would be completely independent to the other loot pools/tables/chances,

and these drops would ALWAYS be for a mod your missing

&amp;#x200B;

this would give people a way to earn missing mods without it being handed to them,

I understand its supposed to be a grindy game and I have played since Destiny 1, but seriously 50 runs/clears at a chance at an exotic where it is supposed to be common must mean my rng sucks.

Tried for an hour at the boss and had to bail.  Typically clear the boss on 1st or 2nd try with 4 bomb.  I was definitely the cause of some of the wipes.  2 bomb seemed very chaotic to me.  4 bomb bypasses most of the mechanics."
1,Primeval health,"Hi, I’m a player who has been here for a relatively long time, and tonight while I was trying to grind for a bottom dollar I realized just how easy the primeval is to kill in gambit.

I feel like gambit is at an okay state right now, not as long as it was when it first launched but not too short, but I feel gambits worst problem is the primeval phase. In gambit you spend all of your time getting motes while also trying to drain and invade to stop the other team from getting motes, and then once you get enough to defeat a primeval. The main issue I have with the primeval is that it gets immediately melted with just 2x primeval slayer, and I feel like gambit would benefit if it went back to the original 75 motes for the primeval and made it so that the primeval fight would last longer.

Thoughts?"
1,Could it be possible for perks on already existing legendary weapons to be changed?,"Obviously, players cannot change the perks on their weapons, but with the talks of making bottomless grief and celery intrinsic (and other discussions like making full auto trigger intrinsic on pulse rifles), I was wondering it is possible for a change like this to affect already existing guns.

For instance, imagine bungie wants to change all pulse rifles to just have full auto. Could they replace the perk on legendaries that already exist? is that possible with the was the game works from a technical standpoint? is there any precedent for them doing this or making changes similar to this?"

1,The state of Bows in PVP &amp; Ticcu's Divination,"We all got excited watching the new season trailer come out. OMG, tracking arrows!! And then everyone had to get PVP Kills with it. That where things got a little sour. It left a bad taste in some peoples mouths. Well, Ticcus Divination can be an unwieldy fellow. The tracking is on point, and can even give you an edge when tracking a target especially around a corner (neat concept). HOWEVER, I find it painfully difficult to land precision shots with this bow. Most bow users need to lead off their shots a bit, since bows ""take some time"" to reach their target. (Higher draw time = faster arrow) But with the new exotic bow, Tracking a target at 20-40 meters gets quite difficult i.m.o. and although the ""opportunity"" occasionally presents itself when a team of guardians hold hands, and you light the group up, it just just doesn't seem consistent. 
    *A bit of a side note :  I have noticed over the past few seasons, Bungie has slowly been lowering stats on our favorite archetypes of weapons. Enough that we don't notice a whole lot until we get further down the line. Aim assist was the first thing I noticed. Each following weapon introduced in a new season has had a bit lower aim assist than its predecessor, but in turn has had larger perk pools. This also plays into the potential kill chaining ability of certain archetypes. Bungie is limiting chained kills to 3 targets so things don't get out of hand (I'm looking at you SunShot). Trinity Ghoul caps around 3 targets per light rod shot (occasionally a 4th).  Okay...back to the good stuff...Bows!*

**I know most people dislike bows, and trust me, I get it. You get frustrated when you use them or when other people use them against you. Getting nailed by Le Monarque through out a game is annoying. Trying to use a bow and not racking up your normal numbers sucks! Whiffing an arrow...well, might as well turn around and hide or you die.**

Either way, this season we got 2 lightweight bows added into the mix. And I was super stoked to try out an Imperial Needle with Impulse Amplifier and Swashbuckler. Needless to say, it felt underwhelming. Same goes with Ticcus Divination.

I have been using bows since the start of my Destiny 2 relationship. Its been a love/hate relationship, but I've learned the ins and outs of where they shine and were they don't. I have about 12k bow kills in the crucible (and I bow swap to hand cannons mostly), so I think I've got the hang of it by now. Being a PVP main, I try to give a loadout a solid try before shelving a weapon for good. I love Bows, regardless of how much they get shit on. It feels good to shit on others using a ""shitty"" weapon.

I know I can trust most all of you put your hands on a bow this season, I saw all the whiny posts about gating the catalyst behind PVP kills. It seems underwhelming, it is a ""sort of"" a high risk/high reward weapon. Multiple hip fire shots suck. Trinity Ghouls hip fire shots do more damage...So what do you all feel? Did Bungie hit its mark in introducing this new exotic bow?

I feel like somethings got to change with Bows. Another exotic that pairs with bow play style. An intrinsic/synergistic pairing like Sturm/Drang. I feel like Hush was a step in the right direction. It rewarded an up close and personal play style with Archers Gambit. Bows are by far the most underrepresented weapon type in the game."
1,Just bought expansions after a hiatus and am lost on what to do,"I quit destiny before shadowkeep. And have hopped on every other month or so for a couple hours.

Now i am kinda lost as to what i am supposed to be doing. Like what to i do first. Im guessing that i should do shadowkeep campaign and than do beyond light and than do the season stuff.

1,Finding Toland in the Dreaming City Bounty Bug,"So I was doing my weekly Dreaming City grind and noticed that the daily challenge bounty from Petra wasn't completing. It says to find Toland in the ascendant challenge, which I did, multiple times, with resetting the bounty and reloading the Dreaming City, and no completion. All I could find online was sources telling me to do the exact same thing I was doing. I think the bounty is bugged and not completing unfortunately."
1,"This will probably be downvoted, but as a more casual Destiny player, I feel like I'm being pushed further and further away from it by both Bungie and the community. I know Year One catered TOO much to casuals, but now we are going entirely the opposite direction with some content.","If I want a Catalyst for Dead Man's Tale I need to find two players and bust my ass off trying to finish Glykon in a tiny amount of time. Not too hard, it's fine.

If I want to raid I need to go to an out of game LFG, find a team that fits me, then go thrugh one of three raids, all of which are honestly kinda hard for the average player (at least if you don't use cheese for Last Wish.) It's fine though, you could use that glitch in DSC to get a mere 10 tokens a week and pick up the scraps from other gone raids. Oh no wait *you can't*, because Bungie fixed that rather then the sparrow speed bug or something important.

If you want to get the big amount of Bright Dust from the challenges this season, I SURE HOPE YOU LIKIE TRIALS OF OSIRIS, AKA the sweatiest PvP game mode in Destiny. You need to get all but two challenges for the big Dust, so you WILL need to do this and find two more people on out of game LFG. But hey, maybe you can get one of those sweet Adapt weapons right? Sure, if you SWEAT YOUR ARSE OFF, GET HELLA LUCKY, AND GET FLAWLESS.  


Make a post on Reddit about how while Year 1 catered too much to the Casual, the game is leaning TOO much to the hardcore now? Not only will Bungie totaly ignore it, but it will be killed by downvotes immediatly before it's even seen, because god forbid that we make a game even slightly more accessable! You are just whinging because you want easy good loot!   


**No, no I'm really not.** *I don't give a single FUCK about Anarchy (My raiding freind uses it better anyway) or geting a god rolled Adapt Shadow Price when my Warmind Auto Rifle does just fine.* Even if it looks like it with my words, the issue is that both the game, the community, and the developers are going all in on the hardcore direction. Raids are gatekept by LFG. Trails you NEED to find two other people who are godly at PvP. You HAVE to go into the hardest version of Glykon forthe Catalyst to complete the gun. And if you mention any of these as issues, the cumminity will handily disagree.  


**I have a friend now who is perfectly willing to help me with** ***ALL*** **of this shit. I can probably DO all of this, or most of this, with a little bit of sweat. But as a casual player of Destiny, I've never felt more alone, isolated or marginalized.**"
1,Surrounded appears to be bugged.,"I was curious about the damage buff that Surrounded gave, so instead of just looking it up I started actually paying attention to the damage I was doing. And then I noticed that it was not consistent in the slightest.

This is both with and without the spec. It’s an Ikelos SMG, masterworked stability. These clips are from Xbox gameplay. 

Maybe there is a reason behind what’s causing the perk to not proc consistently, but I am too smooth brain to understand. I couldn’t find much using the ol’ Google except some stuff pretty recently about the spec not giving the bonus damage buff or lasting the extra time [which I was not paying attention to and am currently too tired to review these clips more closely or keep testing]. Am I late to the game? I’m gonna feel like a big dumb dummy head if I masterworked this lovely Threat Detector x Surrounded Ikelos if Surrounded has been none to be wonky."
1,Trying to get my infamy reset in Gambit should be considered as some form of psychological torture,"I never bothered to get the reset on my infamy since they changed gambit but decided to try this season and my god I've never been more tilted in my life. All matches play out the same first team to get a bank drain with blockers and invasion at the same time will likely be the winners.

   Not to mention the type of teammates you run into, blueberries just seem to pretend the bank being drained isn't an issue and go on about killing ads to get 15 motes just to be killed by the invader with a dead mans tale, Truth, or Eyes of Tomorrow before they ever get to deposit their motes because they refuse to help you kill the blockers draining bank. Then there's the times were your 3 other teammates leave you to kill all the ads by yourself usually resulting in your death and losing your motes they're usually just dicking off doing god knows what. Last but not least you have the guy who thinks he's good at invading who hogs heavy camps the portal just for him to die in like the first few seconds of the invasion."

1,Le Monarque + Void Burn = very dead Overload Champions,"So I have been grinding today’s legend lost sector for a while and let me just say: Unstoppable Champions are a nice, welcome challenge. Barrier Champions, while annoying, have a clever, interesting mechanic that forces you to use strategy. But I hate… no, I LOATHE Overload Champions. The fact that you can’t re-stun them quick enough, and if you miss your timing by just a hair, their health is almost fully regenerated within a fraction of a second. 

That is, until I decided to try Le Monarque on Bunker E15 today, and learned a fun new fact: the poison DoT from Monarque reapplies the stun effect. This bow DESTROYS Overload Champions during void burn (like today) and I imagine it’s probably pretty good even without. 

I know this probably isn’t news but it’s news to me, and who knows, maybe someone else."

Near the end, Shaw does an interesting move with his Light: 

""Shaw spots several Gladiator detachments redirecting to confront them. He pushes the bulk of his Light into his weapon, spreads its influence to reach the nearby Redjacks, and reignites his gun before touching the barrel to the ground and firing. The ground bubbles with hot magmatic Light; a warmth envelops the Redjacks as Solar flame imbues and empowers their rifles with golden power. Shaw directs the firestorm of golden Redjack rifles to incinerate every last charging foe.""

I know Bungie talked about redoing class supers and consolidating some that were underused, so this seems like a super cool ability that we might see in the future, a sort of Titan Bubble applied directly to our weapons from a Hunter."
1,can i get adept icarus from gms?,cbf banging my head against trials for hours
1,Suggestions to improve the stasis experience (from the receiving end),"Stasis is here to stay, we all know that. We also know how it feels to die to it in pvp. I want to feel like I died fair and square in pvp and being frozen from around the corner ain't it chief. There's currently no way (to my knowledge) to counter or out-play a stasis engagement and I want to suggest a fairly simple fix.

Imagine a world: while frozen there was a quicktime event where you'd push a random key or button to break stasis instantly instead of mashing the same key/button. In my head this would lead to some out-play potential for the receiving end, we need to be able to break stasis quickly and feel rewarded for it. In the current state of stasis I'm not even sure why bugie gives you the option to break free, you simply get frozen and die, I don't think I've ever gotten the chance to break stasis and actually survive the encounter.

At the end of the day they could just reduce the amount of time a guardian gets frozen for and I think we'd all be happy with that. Thoughts?"
1,I’m going for Dredgen but I can’t get thrillmonger medals,"I got more than fourty kills and didn’t die, didn’t count in the triumph menu"
1,Sniper reload delay,"I dont expect this to be fixed anytime soon, but holy f is it disorienting when I finish my sniper reload animation, aim down sights and click 4 times before the gun shoots. What's with this???"
1,I have finished my GM this week but didn't get my triumph,"Title explains it. 

I have obtained last season conqueror title, so I am trying to guild that one using the 4 subclasses and this one is working fine. 

But the triumph stating my actual completion of the nightfall in the GM difficult didn't pop up for me. Is this happening to someone else?"
1,What is this week’s pinnacle armor piece from Prophecy?,It was legs last week.  I hope it’s chest this week.  Anybody that’s done it know?
1,"PS4 player switched to PC, which dlc to buy?","Hello,

So I built a new PC and decided to buy destiny. I have all dlcs on PS except beyond light. Last I played was 2 seasons ago. 

Should I just buy beyond light + season pass or do I need shadowkeep?

Did they make moon content obsolete with beyond light or can we get powerful/pinnacle loot from GoS, dungeon, nightmares etc...

Thank you"
1,What titan super has the most DPS without exotic?,"I know it’s fallen star cuirass but without any exotics, which titan super is the strongest ?"
1,Palindrome for PvE,"I have one with Outlaw/Rampage and High Calibre.
Useful for pve or SMGs &gt; all ?"
1,Tier 3 Umbral Engrams,"Tier 3 Focused Umbral engrams **NEED** to be at least ""Powerful"" drops. 

It is an insult to every player's time to expect us to grind enough Cabal Gold, then enough Hammer Charges for a Tier 3 engram to have them capped at 1300 **AND** limited to 3 per week. 

This ruins incentive to participate in the Umbral gameplay loop for players on the Pinnacle power climb. The problem only stands to get worse as we go forward and the power climb is reduced to 10/10."
1,not a big fan of having to do a GM NF for a seasonal challenge personally,i’m less than excited to do the salvo crucible ornament but even less so for a challenge i can’t physically complete since me at max possible power is 1320. i hope they change this one to master difficulty at the very least
1,"Hear me out Bungie: 3 Titans vs 3 Hunters vs 3 Warlocks in a crucible match, whoever wins, scores a point for their team in GG.",That way Main Hunters (which mostly focus on pvp) will really care for Guardians Games.
1,CWL and a warmind mods,"I’m fairly new to Reddit so I apologize if this has been addressed already. I returned to D2 with Beyond Light after a year or two off so, there are plenty of CWL and warmind mods that I’m missing. Has bungie said why they don’t make them farmable or have an alternative way to get them other than to HOPE banshee has it for sale? Looking through things online and it seems a lot of people have this same issue. I feel as those mods are very important for build diversity and higher endgame content that there should be a more reliable way to obtain them. Even though they reverted sunsetting, I understand the idea behind that and there’s a conversation to be had there but, I don’t understand the current mod scarcity."
1,"Bungie, really? Come on now!","So I own destiny 2 and all the expansions on my playstation. I recently downloaded destiny 2 free to play on my pc so I could mess about in gambit/crucible/strikes on my lunchtimes. 

However.... I am stuck with this stupid notification telling me I have unlocked my first stasis aspect and I need to inspect my stasis subclass to remove the notification. Only I cant, because I don't have beyond light on pc. 

Come on Bungie, be better! Like it's greedy enough that you are trying to make me buy dlcs twice! But whatever, I would accept that and just play the free content on pc. But at least test this shit! I shouldn't have the bottom of my screen taken up by a notification I can't get rid of!!! That's just annoying!"
1,My masterworked Ghost shell is now gone.,"Title. I had a masterworked warlock rival shell from Guardian games from last year. It disappeared after today (3-16-21) update. 
What gives?"
1,Im lookin for an good Overall Loadout...,Any advices? :-)
1,Rotating the pinnacle dungeon weekly would add much needed diversity to the game.,"I just find prophecy getting drier and drier by the week, and feel like if we had a real good reason to do the other ones, it would add some spice to the game."
1,Bungie thinks limiting rewards is a good way to boost engagement. They're probably right.,Title says it all
1,Grandmasters should have guaranteed weapon drops (given they drop randomly rolled) or have a higher scaling drop rate compared to other levels.,"My fireteam and I just ran 3 GM nightfalls back to back, hitting platinum on 2 and gold on 1, and only one run (gold rewards) gave one person the weapon and an adept mod. The platinum runs gave us random legendary pieces and prisms. No exotic shards either. 

You’d think for running the “most
challenging” content in the game there’d be a more consistent drop rate for those completing it."
1,Which exotic to get from Monuments To Lost Light,"I’ve got all the materials gathered up and I was just looking for some input from some other people. My options that I have left to grab are: 
 
Rat king 
Jötunn
Le Monarque 
Izinagi’s Burden 
Bastion 
Symmetry 

Thanks in advance for any input!"
1,Any chance we can have our class specific swords back,"I love those things and each version is sunset. I'll re-earn new ones if they ever decided to do that, but let me offer a quick fix for the time being. In the same vain as the menagerie versions of drang and mini-tool being sunset, but the og versions are not, could we possibly get the old versions out of sunset? Put them in the kiosk even for those who are playing post beyond light. Either way I just miss them. (And change up the warlock stance/holding of their sword just like titans and hunters are unique ok bye)"
1,Destiny 2 be like “Let’s grind 80 hours for this thing that won’t be as good in 4 months”,.
1,Warlocks being mangled,"Warlocks being mangled.

I’m a concerned Warlock. No class in the game has had a subclass deleted but Warlocks(Sunsinger).

We get a new subclass Nova Warp and it gets mangled and forgotten about, it was left with the handheld supernova, that was shutdown along with the gauntlets. 

We get a new stasis super and it was a bit op in the beginning and it got mangled. Penumbral blast was like two feet and done, the super didn’t track anymore and it lost a lot of damage. You do nothing to bosses with that and only the abilities work well in crucible.

We have top tree Arc, the melee chain that got killed but Titans have boots that do pretty much the same thing 🤷🏾‍♂️ it’s not dead or weakened. 

Now the only thing we had was Chaos Reach and now it’s going away. Why do you guys love killing off the Warlocks? Let us live a little. I guess all we can be is middle tree solar for support with lunafaction boots. I know people will speak of top tree solar but yeah take it into pve and see how that works for you. I really hope I’m not the only one that feels this way. PLEASE HELP US OUT! A concerned Warlock main."
1,Any chance of Europa pvp maps?,Title
1,Adept NF weapons for GMNF should be guaranteed if you get platinum IMO.,I can understand not getting a weapon drop if you speed run the GM and not kill champions but if teams platinum the NF I think have a guaranteed drop isn’t too much to ask. Thoughts?
1,More sparrow sounds please!,Aren’t you bored listening to the same sparrow noise no matter what sparrow you have? Me too. Anyways...
1,Can we get a Lock Items Feature for our Postmaster?,"Can we get a lock items feature for our postmaster items? It would be a massive help because blues and umbrals can clog up our postmaster after a couple of hours of playtime. Losing Ascendant shards, Prisms, Spoils, etc. is very frustrating. Losing 10 Ascendant shards is a good example because it is hours of time gone to waste. This would be less stressful to us players who stack materials in our postmaster. Would be cool to see how other players feel about this, anyways have a good day!"
1,"Given that we can guild conquerer and are only having a 10 power difference between seasons, can we get GMs going earlier in the year.","Basically, title. I'd like to get guilded conquerer earlier in the season and removing the high power grind can be part of making that happen."
1,New Harbinger Boss This Week? 3/16/21,Just beat the Harbinger Mission Solo. Maybe I haven't completed it on this weekly rotation but it wasn't the normal Taken Knight boss. It was 2 Taken Centurions (annoying AF) spamming axion darts. Am I tripping or have they been the boss before?
1,Bungie Please stop with the Brass Attacks,I think it's worse than Edge Transit.
1,Saladman going unusually hard,"It seems as though Saladin is pushing the extinction of the cabal pretty hard....as if savathun's mind control may be in play here . he's always been portrayed as an excellent tactician but with the hive really posing more of a threat than the cabal and Caital sharing some common ground with us wanting to Thanos dust them, i would think he would push for a conditional treaty as opposed to fighting multiple enemies. Also since Caitl denied the attempt on Zavala, who did?.... it paints more and more of a bitch queen picture"
1,Can something finally be done with the pvp weapon balancing and ammo economy?,"If you don't play HC + sniper or HC + shotgun, you simply are at a huge disadvantage. It's really bad how we have so many weapon times and archetypes yet if you look at the top 15 most used legendary weapons in competitive PVP, you get :

* 7 HCs (5 are 120 RPM)
* 3 sniper rifles
* 3 shotguns
* 1 pulse rifle
* 1 auto rifle

And if you do consider exotics, in the top 15 most used weapons, 8 are HCs. Of those 8 HCs, 6 are 120 RPM. What sort of weapon diversity is this?!

Bows (beside certain exotics) are extremely bad and too vulnerable to flinch. Same thing for the majority of scout rifles beside DMT (low zoom = less affected by flinch and same/faster TTK as 120 RPM HCs). Autorifles, for the most part, are a joke and require too many shots to kill and constant fire so you can't peak-&gt;shoot-&gt;peak-&gt;shoot... which is a huge detriment. SMGs are essentially worse autorifles and are outclassed by slug shotguns which are outclassed by using buckshot shotguns while sliding toward your target. Pulse rifles have bad TTK (beside the 540 RPM achetype) and, for the most part, the same drop off as 140 RPM HCs so there's no reason to use them over HCs. 

Finally, remove scavenger perk effects in PVP. People are able to cruch too much on their special weapon and barely ever use their primaries (that's one of many reasons felwinter is #1 most used weapon and Astral Horizon is 4th most used weapon)."
1,Bungie needs to add rule that can suspend a player from playing nightfalls if they leave early,"Like with gambit and comp. Im tired of having to wait, or even restart a nightfall just because some dude decided to be a dick and leave."
1,I can't see my chat,"This started yesterday and whenever I say something in chat, I cannot see it and not sure if who i'm chatting to can see it either. Anyone know a fix to this? thanks"
1,1300 lost sectors are stupid.,"So I’ve done quite a few of these and no matter my light, I’m getting pretty much insta killed.  I have been doing them and every time I get new a champion even with protective light I’m getting insta killed, and the reason I find this annoying is because I’m 15 above the recommended and still getting melted."
1,Bumgie Updates,It's nerf or nothing
1,"SGA: Update ""ghosted"" my ghost",[removed]
1,Break down of elemental wells,"*all testing was done within the haunted lost sector Terminus East, on the EDZ, this was so i had a constant stream of enermies as well as various ranks, since the tribute hall disappeared*

first, they do not work in any measure for pvp, as the mods say combatants. And after testing within PvP there is no ifs or buts / work arounds that i found

now on to the fun stuff

# Basic mod function

every mods comes with this

&gt;Picking up an elemental well grants energy to your ability with the  lowest current energy. Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass damage type grants energy to ALL of your abilities

**Translation :** 

you'll see an discoloured orb of power on the floor pick it up and receive ability energy back.

~~pick up glowy orb on ground, get ability energy for your least charged ability~~

~~if glowy orb matches your glowy powers, get ability energy for all abilities~~

**Specfics :** 

from my testing you get a flat 10% of ability energy PER well with no cool down on this effect

this is the same with the matching vs unmatched with subclass just you get 10% to 1 ability vs 3,

this wells last 20sec from time of summoning, descent but i have wasted many a well because they can be lost in a sea of bodies

**Notes :**

* unlike the warmind cells there is NO way to generate wells without a mod that says it can
   * warmind cells say that ikelos and seventh serif weapons will summon a cell
* multiple mods have no effect

# Elemental Armaments

&gt;Weapons Take downs with a damage type that matches your subclass element have an escalating chance to spawn an elemental well

Translation : kills with a gun that matches your sub class will spawn a well,..... eventually

**Specifics**

this is a flat x amount of kills to spawn a well like with warmind cells, the perk description is VERY vague and misleading in this regard

with testing there is no difference between heavy, special, or primary weapons. they all take 7 kills to proc

further testing showed no difference in ranks, 1 kill is 1 kill

EDIT : forgot mod stacking doesnt work, 1 mod or 5 it still takes 7 kills

**Notes :**

* multi kills count fully, even risky and trinity's arc chains count
* Weapon Types dont matter Rocket launchers through side arms all the same 7 kills
* didnt test cursed thrall of explody shanks

# FONT OF MIGHT

&gt;Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass grants a temporary bonus to weapon damage of that same elemental type

**Translation** : if the elemental well is the same as your subclass any weapons that also match gain a temporary damage bonus

**Specfics** :

this is a FLAT 10% damage buff regardless of the weapon or enemy

this buff last for 5 sec and is capped at 5 sec, regardless

**Notes ;**

* stacking mods doesn't work 1 or 5 mods it's still 10%
* stacks with Debuffs
* as im a solo player with somewhat limited time i didn't have time to test this with buffs

# Elemental Light

&gt;Defeating a combatant with your Super spawns an elemental well that matchs your subclass energy type

**Translation :** super kills generate elemental wells

**Specifics :**

i dont know HOW this works but i believe there is a cooldown on the well spawning, 

* fist of havoc seemed to spawn a well every light attack but slamming seemed be capped at 1 well
* thunder crash spawned one well initially but as i lead red bars into the after shock more spawned

but any way this is simple kills in super generate a well that matchs your sub class

Notes :

* again mod stacking is useless

# Font Of WISDOM

&gt;Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass energy type grants you an temporary significant increase in your intellect, improving the recharge rate of your super.

**Translation** : Subclass matching wells grants increased intellect.

**Specifics :**

this lasts 30seconds,

this is HARD capped at that 30seconds, regardless of how many you pick up you just reset the timer

**Notes IMPORTANT:**

* i was unable to test the increase granted as the only way i choudl think to test this would be have a teammate generate wells for you
   * this is because kills will decrease your super regen time
   * if anyone has this data i would love to see it.
   * if anyone knows a way i could test this solo i would really want to know
* due to being unable to get solid numbers i dont know if mod stacking applies
* i apologise for all the missing info

# Elemental Ordnance

&gt;Defeating a Combatant with a grenade spawns an elemental well that matches your subclass energy type

**Translation :** grenade kills spawn a well.

**Specific's :**

nothing note worthy 

apart from there seems to be a cooldown between summons, 

grenade kills = elemental well

Notes : 

* no mod stacking
* grenades all share the same cooldown
   * so no top tree striker or Sunbracers spam
* i wonder if grenades and super share that cooldown

&amp;#x200B;

Last But not least

# Elemental Charge

&gt;Become Charged with light by picking up an elemental well. if the elemental well's element type matches your subclass you gain 2 stacks of charged with light

no translation needed this is exactly as it says.

**Specifics :**

this is very clear cut, just remember you NEED something equiped that can burn a charge with light to pick up a charge

i made that mistake, and yeah thought it was busted turns out im an idiot

**Notes ;** 

* should have put this at the start no mods stack as far as my testing has shown

# thoughts

***TLDR :*** *these mods arnt the best there a GREAT introduction into the combat style mod system and are FAR easier to obtain then the other combat style mods however they have glaring issues such as a lack of PvP function as well as being rather weak*

these are nice especially for players wanting to ability spam, in PvE

my biggest issue is the push for aggressive play as the wells spawn where the enemy dies limiting use in high end content.

BUT they feel limp there a great beginners guide to combat style mods but anything they do a charged with light or warmind cell can do and generally better

# as for PVP

i have NO idea why they arnt allowed, why didnt bungie make them spawn/work for PvP

**Stasis**

a non issue, its VERY difficult to spawn these with stasis so especially with no competitive stasis weapons, and all grenade kills hard as hell

* shatter doesn't count and using supers and sometimes be buggy due to how shatter damage and super damage aren't tied together, 
* titans have the greatest ease of summon, but it knee caps the HELL out of the super

Damage Buff

its 10%, and elemental dependant, making it VERY selective in usage

**Charged with light**

maybe, but apart from you know disabling that one mod, if it was broken

it also requires you to spec into summoning these wells, that means at least 2 well mods, and then 1 charged with light, thats at MINIMUM. 

i would recommend armaments and ordinance with charged, then sprinkle in high energy fire. **(if they worked)**

the issue is thats 4 mods and the energy required for them lost, let alone the missing powerful friends or Radiant light

&amp;#x200B;

I hope bungie keeps expanding these mods.

if you have any info you want to add please DM me or comment it.

if not thanks for reading my error filled data compilation"
1,Seems the 'Rivals' ghost shells have been re-locked for Guardian Games. Good thing I wasn't using them or anything.,"Guess I'll have to level a new ghost shell until I have to re unlock these. For some reason.

1,Returning Player,"Stopped playing after Curse of Osiris dropped and now that it’s on game pass all my buddies have decided to get into Destiny. 

What are the good archetypes for each weapon? I see 450 AR’s being thrashed but what about pulses, smg’s, scouts? 

What are some of the desired legendaries/exotics for pve (weapons and armor we run Titans and hunters) 

What are desired perks for PvE? we don’t play pvp. 

What are some other tips and tricks for end game content? Really trying to make it worth their while so they continue to play beyond this season... 

Thanks in advance!"
1,Touch of Malice would be insane in the well of radiance which is exactly why it won’t be added in the game.,Infinite bonus damage for 30 seconds without reloading? Touch of malice would become the original Lunafaction tool.
1,Let Armor drops increase by +5 each year of Destiny,"With Sunsetting now gone, there is no true incentive once people find their best sets of armor, and realistically, you aren’t playing an MMORPG if the endgame isn’t just completely nitpicking in specific aspects of loot like weapons and armor. Destiny now let us have our (new) loot for an infinitude periods of time but it’s loot structure will eventually plateau. As a player, what incentive do I have to look for other armor in the game if all the armor slots are either not compatible with what I want in my build or is just flat out worse than what I already have? I stated that gear would eventually just plateau, eventually it’ll come to the point where everything is at its most potent which means I will have a total of total 433* (I don’t know if this allows a 400 total stat roll yet that probably requires optimization of builds) maximum potential stat points (season of the chosen)

(67 x 3 + 72 (exotic) + 50 (mods) + 20 strength + 20 mobility (Radiant Light and Powerful Friends) (also can add statsis fragments or mods in future content updates) + 12 x 5 for masterworked armor)

Armor stats are not allowed to be placed onto specific categories unfortunately so we’ll all succumb to the eventually grasp of RNGesus which hiss behind any sort of random generation of numbers but an eventual addition of +5 to a stat will allow the player who has the potential 433 stat rolled armor to look for more pieces of armor and even then, with the heavily optimized armor, the player doesn’t have to switch to the newer gear! They’re allowed to stick with the old gear since there is next to no downsides to switching out the old with the new and vice versa, and especially with transmog, armor pieces are no longer limited by their appearance.

TLDR: Adding a +5 to all armor pieces can add new variety and a reason for veteran players who already have maxed stats to care about armor again."
1,Wish ender,If I kill the boss on the final charge will the Minotaur still spawn to get the last relic?
1,When’s the next time the DLCs will go on sale?,Is there any way of knowing? I don’t want to buy a mostly negative reviewed DLC for 40$
1,"While Destiny may have it’s issues, one thing that’s very admirable is the quality of exotic hand cannons.","Ace of Spades - Kill. Reload. Count 6 shots. Reload. Repeat. 6 shots that never fail… Momento mori, my friend. 

Hawkmoon - A transformative weapon that you can hear the power of the Light through with every shot.

The Last Word - An old, reliable piece of iron that will never fail so long as you hit your shots, and learn to adapt to it’s unique shooting style. 

Thorn - A weapon as Dark as the souls of those struck by it. With every shot, you can watch as it devours your enemies and their very essences. 

Sunshot - A weapon as powerful as fire itself. Burning bright, always, and incinerating all in it’s path. 

Lumina - An old hand cannon reforged, from Sorrow into Hope. Instead of the power to drain the Light, it restores it. 

I really admire the quality of exotic hand cannons. While some, like The Last word (overshadowed by DMT) or Sunshot (overshadowed by Trinity Ghoul), may not be viable over other things, the quality of the guns and every shot I take with them always seems to amaze me. Bungie obviously put a lot of effort into them. Like look at the giant Wild West story of the Last Word vs Thorn! While Bungie may have it’s flaws, it’s clear they put a lot of effort into these things."

When I swapped to a New Shell, the Rival shell didnt appear in my inventory and when I pulled it from collections and tried to re-equip it, it said the item was unavailable. Not super upset about it but I lost some upgrade materials so Im not super happy either - anybody else run into this?

1,Special Ammo economy needs an adjustment,"Imo, one of the biggest problems with PvP, that’s been going on for a long time is special weapon ammo economy, mostly when it comes to ohk weapons.
There’s too much ammo for weapons that can be too deadly.

Even without scavenger mods, you can easily play a whole match with only your special weapon. And for how strong their ohk potential is, it’s stupid how much ammo you get."
1,Pinnacle weekly rewards not dropping?!?!? STILL,"I play with a buddy constantly, he rarely gets his pinnacle rewards ever, he levels up from high end activity drops and he’s gotten to 1317, week after week..he never gets then. We just did 3 vanguard strikes with the matching subclass, I got the reward, he didnt. Ive posted about this multiple times, no one seems to know, he was going to buy the expansions but now wont even think about it, its getting absurd. Does ANYONE have an answer for this?"
1,Omnioculus infinite invisibility Nerf,"I've seen some posts about this get completely obliterated, so I thought I'd try to explain my reasoning  as to why this was a unnecessary move from Bungie. Most of the comments arguing for the nerf was because it was an unintended bug that was game breaking but the fact of the matter is the exact same infinite invis can still be achieved using travelers chosen. Not only that but I'd argue this combo is even more powerful than rat king because it not only returns melee energy but also grenade and dodge energy. I understand the support mindset Bungie had when they made this exotic but removing its synergy with rat king seems pointless if you can achieve an even more powerful synergy with another exotic still in the game. The reason I liked using rat king was the dark shadows theme it brought to the subclass. I'll miss you rat king, travelers chosen is the play now."
1,Maximum carnage glitch,"I was playing gambit and decided to invade. I killed all 4 of them, and just stayed invading. I know this is a glitch but does anyone know what causes it? Could it be killing someone as the timer hits zero, because I feel like thats what happened. I was able to get a maximum carnage badge out of it though!"

1,In depth breakdown of light supers and what needs adjustments,"I was going to not post anything about any light subclasses tuning because I figured Bungie had their hands full with making stasis somewhat balanced in PvP, but since they decided chaos reach needed to be tweaked I guess asking for other subclasses to be looked at is fair game.

I only play as one character so I can't speak for titans or hunters but I know some of their light subclasses are severely underpowered against stasis (middle tree sentinel can't block stasis) or just in general so I invite them to post in the comments the things that need to be changed about theirs.

As for myself, I've been using nova warp almost exclusively since season of the chosen began, long before warlocks had their week of rebelling by using it (where did all of our motivation go after like 4 days guys? come on, this is why we suck at guardian games). I think I have a pretty good grasp of the shortcomings on the subclass as well as its strengths.

Neutral game: warlocks have a pretty generic middle game excluding top tree dawn, but nova warp has an interesting kit nonetheless.

* Hand held super nova: What was once one of the most broken abilities in crucible is now at best a shitty fusion rifle. There was an incorrect patch note that self damage was reduced to 25%, I can assure you that's not the case in PvP. Its charge time is excessive, its range is mediocre, and the low hold time means your timing has to be near perfect.  
Buff: lower charge time OR longer hold time, giving it both could make it overpowered
* Melee: Honestly a pretty good melee, it works sometimes to push away the other person out of melee range and they just swing at nothing, other times they lunge their melee into you and you die, meh  
Buff: Nothing, pretty balanced
* Dark matter: Honestly a slept on part of the tree. Kills with any of your abilities help recharge your other abilities and return health. This often will make it so you can take more than 1 shot from a handcannon after getting a kill with an ability and maybe get to cover.
* Nova Warp: Oh boy, this super has become a verb at this point. ""they're going to nova warp that super"". Translation: It's strong, and bungie's decision for nerfs is to take every part of what makes it good, and nerf each one of them individually.  
**Charge time**: there is no other roaming super in the game that requires you to charge.  
**Reduced movement speed while charging**: too much, I understand why this is necessary but the current movement speed while charging is like crouch walking  
**Dark Blink**: I've had situations where its cost me half my super to get to someone, the cost to blink is marginally too high, a minor reduction in super cost would go a long way  
**Explosion/Damage**: This will forever be a lopsided fight, it shouldn't be able to one shot other roaming supers yet it will never be able to get two explosions off before the other super can shut it down. That being said the range of the explosion could maybe be increased by a minor amount to allow the novawarp a chance to take them on  
**Miscellaneous**: I know comparing this super to behemoth titans isn't really a fair comparison but look at it like this, behemoth light attacks are more lethal than nova warp heavy attacks and actually offer mobility. I have fought countless behemoths in my super actually intentionally doing it at some points to see if there was some weakness novawarp could find. Spoiler: There is not. the light attack of the behemoth can actually allow the titan to escape the explosion of the novawarp. If the heavy attack connects, its over, if the light attacks connects, its over, if the light attack misses, the titan gets out of the damage area.  


Summary  
HHSN: needs the self damage reduction to actually work in PvP  
needs either a decrease to the charge time OR an increase to hold time  
Super: Of the following, 1-2 = still a meh super, 3 = a relatively balanced super, 4 = a top tier super  
Charge time of blast decreased  
Movement while charging is increased to not move at a snails pace  
Explosion range or damage is increased  
Dark blink cost reduced  
Dark Matter health regen is greater while in super?   


Once again I invite other classes to post theirs in the comments, I anticipate many of the comments will be unfriendly, and to those people I simply say, I hope your favorite subclass receives the nova warp treatment"
1,Guardian games ghost shell missing?,Did anyone else lose their guardian ghost shell? I lost all three of mine on each character for each class. I noticed it wasn't loading so I switched off if it and lost it. Anyone else have this happen?
1,"The three adept nightfall guns are great for nostalgic purposes, but I hope bungie brings back the greatest D1 gun in a future update.","The famous Hung Jury !!!!!

As far as I'm concerned it's the most legendary D1 weapon.  Sure, others were sweet like the ghallahorn, but the hung jury was used by almost every player since it was so easy to get.  

It would make me a little less sad about losing my Randy's scout."
1,Nightfall loot,Can you get ALL the adept mods by doing grandmasters?!
1,Is Ward of Dawn supposed to be able to be popped like a bubble?,"I dunno what Bungie's definition of an ""**Indestructible** dome"" is but as far as I know it means a dome that is ""not able to be destroyed"" but one laser from a walker tank can just pop it like that.

Doesn't seem very ""Indestructible"" to me. So, Is it supposed to be unable to be popped? It should at least get an HP buff or something because imo it is destroyed way too easily."
1,5 Gm’s later..,"2 Adept Swarms and 2 Adept mods. 

I like that the mods are farmable, but the weapon drop feels like it should be guaranteed even if the nightfall isn’t particularly difficult."

1,Pinnacle drops in this game are broken.,"3 weeks ago, when i learned that GM nightfalls would be able to be farmed for adept weapons (i was out of the loop) i started seriously grinding pinnacles to reach 1310. That same week, i had 7...i repeat, 7 pinnacles in the same 2 spots. The only pinnacles that actually increased my light were the first 2 that dropped in their respective slots. I got a total of 4 chest pieces, and 3 legs, and only the first in each of those slots increased my overall light. The next week was nearly as bad, but with head pieces and kinetic weapons, with a total of 5 repeating pinnacles. Today, when i was excited for reset to maybe, finally reach 1310, i started pinnacle farming, and my first two pinnacles were bonds, with the first one dropping as a 1309 and the second dropping as 1308 (my base power is 1307). I logged off and switched to another game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bungie, this is demoralizing. There should be no reason for this amount of drop duplication from pinnacles. I get that you want people to keep playing your game all the time, and have reasons to come back every week, but negating HALF or more of my pinnacle drops does the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what to do about it? Honestly, i don't know. I don't know how difficult that is of an issue to address, or how to balance it so you don't reach pinnacle cap day one of a new season, but i do know that losing half or more of your pinnacles a week due to duplication, just out right breaks my drive to play."
1,Help I unbinded Return to Orbit,"I unbinded return to orbit accidentally, how to I get it back. I am a keyboard."
1,Eyes of Tomorrow and the Descendant Title,"This week makes it 54 looted clears without Eyes of Tomorrow dropping.

It's pretty disheartening that week after week, the rocket launcher won't drop when it's all I, and I assume many others, have left to acquire to complete the Descendant title. 

Titles are suppose to show the effort you've put into an activity, albeit the DSC title isn't too difficult, but at this point, I've been through a much fiercer battle with RNG than Taniks himself.

I know previous titles have had elements of RNG tied to them with collections portion like the Shattered Throne ship and Cursebreaker - but those I don't believe had bad luck protection, so there was reason to be disappointed when they didn't drop.

But it's been confirmed that Eyes of Tomorrow does have a cumulative drop chance, whether its an increase per account or per character every week, we don't know, but protection nonetheless.

At this point I'd rather find out at what point do we get to 100% drop rate then have me hopes up every week that it might drop, it would save me the disappointment.

What will probably be more disappointing is that if they find that the bad luck protection hasn't been working and they fix it, it will no doubt ignore all previous completions and we'll need to build up the drop chances again."
1,Completed 5 GM Nightfalls today. AMA.,[removed]
1,Eyes of tomorrow,They fix it yet? Have they mentioned it *anywhere*? I see it nowhere in any of the latest and older patch notes. Would just like to know if I can use the weapon in higher level activities again.
1,Raid Exotic Ranking list,"I am just going to start off by saying that this is just my opinion, and that you are fine to disagree with me. These may be subject to change with future buffs and nerfs, so feel free to let me know if I should change anything. 

Number 6: Tarrabah. I think this gun has huge potential if it receives any changes (which is probably unlikely at this point). While I find it fun to use and it can do some damage in certain scenarios, there are just far better exotics for practical use.

Number 5: Legend of Acrius. This gun is very good in close quarters scenarios when you need big damage, especially with the catalyst, but there are not that many scenarios that can utilize it. There are much better weapons that can fill the heavy exotic slot.

Number 4: Eyes of Tomorrow. This rocket launcher gets out dps'd by some legendary rocket launchers, and that Is not a good thing. It can clear out rooms of ads and majors great, but why would you waste your heavy for that? With the damage reduction against bosses and many other enemies, I put this at number 4. To be fair, though, it is an amazing invade weapon in gambit. 

Number 3: One Thousand Voices. This was going to be Eyes of Tomorrow, but with all the damage nerfs and bugs going around it, I decided to put 1k at number 3. It is fun as hell, does a lot of damage, and has dps comparable to xenophage. It is an S tier weapon, and it is very fun to use.

Number 2: Divinity. This weapon will most likely always be utilized in endgame content as long as somebody has it. This weapon is almost essential to one phase taniks with slug shotguns, and it can be used in many other situations as well (I love helping blueberries do more damage in strikes). This weapon will most likely always be relevant in endgame content, hence my high ranking.

Number 1: Anarchy. I bet you could all see this coming a mile away. It is probably the most versatile weapon in the entire game. Great boss damage, ad clearing, champion killing, and many other things. If you don't have this weapon, this should be one of, if not your top priority to get. Being able to deal damage from behind cover is huge in endgame content, and being able to switch to your special for higher dps is just icing on the cake. 

Thanks for reading everyone.

Cheers"

1,Bungie should support content creators through ornament collaborations.,"I think that Destiny content creators are extremely popular among our community yet underrated by Bungie. I feel that I discuss content creators or their videos in almost every single LFG group I’ve been a part of. This doesn’t happen in other games, yet other major titles support their creators through collaborations or codes in the item shop.

It would be so cool to see ornament collaborations between Bungie and their content creators. Even if its not a full armor set, supporting Bungie through purchasing a Gernader Jake’s last word l or an IFrostBolt titan mark would be a win-win for every party involved. 

Personally im trying to rock a pair of SayWallahBruh gauntlets to help me hit those crispy throwing knives."

1,Nice reminder as to why I never solo queue quickplay,"I am one this subreddits most hated type of player. A pvp sweat who only ever stacks. However today I needed just a bit more cabal gold to get the last hammer charge and since it was just one game, it wasn't worth LFGing and none of my friends were on so I thought I'd just quickly solo queue a single game. This is my first time solo queuing quickplay in ages. Holy fuck I'd completely forgotten how garbage my teammates could be. The enemy team weren't even that good, I was slaying out the entire game, dropped a 7.83 efficiency and 47 opponents defeated (big flex am good). Not a single person on my team went positive or got over 12 defeats against a below average team.  We lost lmao. Will never ever solo queue again. Will only ever stack again from now on. Sorry."
1,BeerThought: How the final mission of the Light And Darkness Saga should go.,"Picture this:
The Darkness has finally made it to Earth. Where the Traveler sits, the lead Pyramid hovering not far. Scale ship and Guardian jumpships flying through the skies, the surrounding orbit of Earth, every planet we have left. Aerial combat the likes of which humanity has never seen before. Meanwhile ground troops fight in a seemingly endless firefight to gain a single step forward on both sides. 

Now we come to you, Guardian, in the midst of the most hardcore ship-to-ship combat experience in your time as a Guardian. Flying through gravitational anomalies while outrunning a swarm of Pyramid Scale ships. Suddenly Ghost cries out that you've lost one of your thrusters and you are now spinning out of control. In an act of reckless desperation, you punch the warp drive activation. 

The next thing you know, you're crashing into solid ground. The gamble worked. You climb out of your ship and look around, and a nauseating wave of nostalgia washes over you as you see rusted cars, a broken highway bridge, and a massive wall. The Cosmodrome. You laugh and check your weapons. Heavy ammo is low, your preferred special is still working, but your Primary weapon is in pieces. Ghost says he's unable to connect to your Vault to get you another optimal weapon. You're already running through the Breach, shooting any Hive or Darkness you come across. Suddenly, your eye catches something. You recognize a symbol used by Hunters to identify a cache they stored away for anyone who finds it. You rush over and rip the cache open. And there it is, you're oldest and fondest friend. Who was there for you at the very Beginning, and now is there for you at the End. Khvostov. Sight is cracked, plenty of ammo, and feels just right in your hands.

""Eyes Up, Guardian!"""

This hurts more people then helps especially with how the new rank up reward system is set up. Change the Legend rank to not lose rank and work more like valor."

1,"Bungie, there needs to be a change in how we acquire mods.","The community going months without any way to access literal build-defining mods is absurd. On top of that, I'm still missing mods that I had in Year 2. The only method to get mods is random chance, either from Gunsmith packages or whatever Banshee sells. This system is doesn't work.

Why not allow us to buy whatever mods we want whenever we want, in the same style as the Monument? Maybe increase the price of the Elemental Well/Charged with Light/Warmind Cell mods, I don't care. Make them accessible and acquirable. 

I wasn't able to log on and get either of the Warmind Cell mods recently on sale because of work. It is extremely frustrating to wait literal *months* for something that only happens on *one day.*"
1,"Although it’s a bandaid fix and there are also other aspects of Trials that need to be fixed, adding post-match rewards would help alleviate a lot of tensions that Trials currently faces regarding playerbase.","There’s absolutely no reason for a casual players (or even anyone below the top 5% for that matter) to go into Trials right now because they’re only going to be getting a few drops a week. Therefore, less casuals play Trials, making it harder for casuals that do want Trials’ loot from getting it. Massive downward spiral in overall playerbase. 

Literally the addition of random postgame rewards, maybe that even increase as you go up the card, would give casuals a reason to play Trials because they are being *rewarded for their time*.  More casuals, the easier it is for casuals to get loot, causing even more casuals to play Trials. Massive upward spiral in overall playerbase. 

I feel like it’s been such a no brainer locked behind the sentiment of “Trials loot is for good players” and the “git gud” mindset associated with Trials, but quite frankly it’s awful that time and resources are going to be allotted to a gamemode that so few play. If there’s an actual playerbase associated with trials, then it would justify development time to be spent on it (ie: general improvements, new loot, etc). There’s so much that Trials needs help with right now, and the addition of postgame rewards is probably the best way to start imo."

1,Dead Mans Tale is OP,"How is a 150rpm Hand Cannon with like 28m range so busted it needs to be nerfed down to 140 and lose its Lightweight perk.

But a 150rpm Scout:
No hipfire penalty.
Allowing faster strafing.
Literally 70m+ range.
Deals 84 damage meaning much more flinch and allows 2H1B thats okay??
(Scouts also received a +15 aim assist at the start of the season)

The first one is busted but the second one is okay?
Im not saying nerf it to the ground, but making it a 140rpm OR decreasing its damage to require 3 Headshots.

The only reason 120 HCs are still viable is their flinch which carries them super hard. (Also nerf 120s a bit..)

1,Infinite Depths - An idea for a Hive procedurally generated cavern system.,"*Who knows how many maze like tunnels and caverns exist below the moon. The Hive have burrowed deep below its surface for years and there are probably a near infinite amount of dark, winding passages connecting to larger caverns. Shouldn't Guardians begin to explore these depths?*

This idea takes inspiration from the Underground DLC from the Division which created procedurally generated levels in the subway system of New York. The Hive set the perfect premise for such an activity and would allow for procedurally generated tunnels &amp; cavern systems to be linked together randomly. Destiny does underground settings very well and with enough tile sets in the mix this could feel near endless. Being the Hive it could even have some suspenseful elements like low light areas utilizing our headlamps paired with spooky ambient sounds to create a more intense experience similar to the recent Presage mission (Loved that one!) 

The activity could have custom settings at the start to allow for setting the length &amp; difficulty and perhaps some modifiers to increase the challenge (and chance for loot to drop). It would be a great way to work on bounties, or completing catalysts and feel less repetitive."

- **Shields are Arc, Solar, AND Void:** Unfortunately, all shield elements are present in this weeks Nightfall, and they all show up in significant enough numbers or places to be a hassle to deal with when Match Game is active.  A sword might help for Captains' Arc shields, but is Risky against Wizards' Solar and will NOT be able to reach Servitors' Void without a lot of dangerous jumping around in the middle of a boss fight.  Speaking of swords...

- **Swords are mixed in terms of usability:**  It's a tough call on whether swords are the best heavy choice this week.  There are several extremely add-heavy encounters, and at least one is in extremely close quarters, so swords are a great help there.  They can be extremely helpful in killing the two giant Brigs during teh Spider Tank fight, and are also a great fallback option during the boss fight to kill Captains or other adds who move in at you a bit aggressively.  Unfortunately, they're practically entirely unusable against this weeks boss and his shielding Servitors, and are also probably dangerous to attempt to use against the Spider Tank.  If you're solo and feel like you can DPS the strike boss and Spider Tank without them then I'd definitely bring one, but if you aren't sure then opt for something with more range.

- **This week's boss is extremely weak to Machine Guns:**  For some reason, this week's boss doesn't seem to register as being an actual strike boss.  As such, machine guns don't get their normal penalty to damage against bosses, and are capable of dealing great damage.  This is especially useful considering how far away the boss can be at times, as well as the amount of teleporting that he does which might cause you to miss shots with something like a rocket or GL.  Machine guns can also fill the same add clearing/""make my problems go away"" role that swords tend to fill, which is nice considering that this week's boss can't really be hit with swords.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think that's it for now, but if anybody else has anything really important to add I'll also add that to the main post.  Hope this helps!"
1,Osmosis Spec mod idea,"this is just an random idea i had for an Osmosis specific mod

[light.gg, osmosis perk](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1774574192/osmosis/)

Name : Osmosis Spec

Description : Kills whist osmosis is active increases grenade recharge

what it does

* after proc'ing osmosis, any kills by the weapon will grant an increase to discipline
   * duration per kill is based on rank
      * red bar                           = 3sec
      * major/champions        = 4sec
      * bosses and guardians = 5sec
   * max duration is capped at 10 sec
   * buff goes away as SOON as the weapon is stowed regardless of remaining time
      * this is just like the perk you lose the element as soon as it is stowed
   * buff to discipline is ;
      * buffedStat = stat + ((100 - stat) \* 0.5)
      * this is rounded up

with this stasis would need to be added to the osmosis list, which would also allow for stasis to use elemental wells more/better

EDIT : after doing the maths below i feel 50% is to high thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

^(just to show off the maths)

^(10 discipline)

^(= 10 + ((100 - 10) \* 0.5))

^(= 10 + 90 \* 0.5)

^(= 10 + 45)

^(= 55 (rounded up))

^(\~= 60)

^(87 discipline) 

^(= 87 + ((100 - 87) \* 0.5))

^(= 87 + (13 \* 0.5))

^(= 87 + 6.5)

^(= 87 + 7 (rounded up))

^(= 94)

^(\~= 100 (rounded up))"

1,My 🧐,"👋🏽

Since With Queen’s being pushed back to 2022, I’d like to say (if Bungie isn’t already planning to) take this time to flush out stasis. 

I’d like to see us having 3 distinct subclass supers, throughout the seasons leading up to WQ, that way we go in with a full arsenal of cans of whoop ass. I’d also like to safely say “we can possibly get the next darkness” class Necrosis in WQ (based off Necrotic Grips &amp; Thorn’s synergy). This may sound asinine but do the same for LightFall, depending upon the state of D2 🧐🤷🏽‍♂️"

1,(idea) New Artifact to affect world/playlist drops,"Been thinking with the loot pool being such a mess, and being near impossible to farm for specific weapons in any play list. Why doesn't bungie introduce some sort new permeant artifact, similar to the the chalice from the Menagerie. But instead it would affect world drops in all playlists. Maybe some new perk or mod slots on our ghost or something.

Rather than having something like the dark decoder to decrypt engram into specific loot drops, why can't we have an artifact or mod that increases our drop changes of a particular weapon or armor piece in any given playlist?

Like if I'm hunting for a rocket launcher from the strike playlist or a hand cannon from Gambit.

There should be a way to improve our drop changes of gear that already has a low drop change to begin with."
1,Bungie. Why have you done this.,"You took away the only reason anyone would actually use the Rat King seriously. The thorn/necrotic grip synergy still works, so why did you have to take the rat king/omnioculus one away? I though they said they were bringing in more armor-weapon combos into the game, so why are they taking them out instead? This combo took a weapon that no one takes seriously and a subclass that only really shines in grandmasters (where this combo wouldn’t be nearly as effective by the way) and gave us an option that was powerful for hunters in pve. It still wasn’t nearly as broken as some of the base warlock subclasses, as well as being much less efficient than Titan builds. There was no reason for this to go, and I’m pissed about it"

1,"Bungie, please don't go too far separating sandboxes.","I know that most of us have been wanting certain guns and abilities to retain their potency in PvE while not being overpowered in PvP, and I consider myself to be in that crowd. 

However, what appeals to me the most about this game is that I can rely on everything that I have equipped functioning exactly the same in both PvE and PvP.  I know that in the heat of the moment, no matter what activity I'm in, I don't have to think about what activity I'm in and what that means for an ability I'm going to use. 

With the latest round of Stasis adjustments Bungie has done something they've never done before, and that is changing the core function of how an ability performs depending on the activity. Casting Glacial Quake in PvP no longer freezes enemies around you in PvP, but it will in PvE. The Hunter Withering Blade shurikens won't apply enough slow stacks to freeze on double impact or combined with the dodge while in PvP, but they will in PvE. 

Changes like the above are great for players that main PvP and barely touch the rest of the game and vice versa. As for players like myself that enjoy them equally, I don't want to see too many of these core functionality changes."

1,"""We don't want people to do the same seal every season, so here's gilded"" - you made gilded conqueror the same as base conqueror the past 3 seasons","So the requirements for gilded conqueror are to all 6 GMs this season. In a TWAB when Gilded was announced this was a quote from it:

""We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!"" 

Yet Gilded is the exact same as base conqueror has been the past few seasons? This was pretty disappointing to find out after finishing the new base conqueror today as I thought we'd get fun challenges to do and be able to finally unlock gilded this week.

Kinda sucks how it's the exact same thing again and we can't get gilded for another 5 weeks so we hardly get to enjoy the golden title.

Will this be changed in future seasons so we get to have gilded for more than a few weeks at the end of  the season and get more interesting challenges to tackle? The all subclass one would have been a good one for gilded conqueror imo."
1,Guided Games could make use of the 12-man raid bug/feature: 6 pre-matched players guiding 6 randoms.,"After seeing another post by a user with similar neurodiversity conditions to me, it sparked an idea on how to revamp the currently, mostly obsolete 'Guided Games' feature. Right now, Guided Games are not really used for a plethora of reasons - from there not really being much reward to doing them to the fact that it's still capped at 6 players, and as most raids require significant coordination, it's hard to help coordinate with randoms who are likely still learning the raid to get objectives complete.  

I think the 12-man Raid bug/feature is ideal for Guided Games. You could allow a group of 6 players with a specified amount of clears in the raid to be the 'guides', which would then match them with 6 randoms or smaller groups (like fireteams of 2-3), who they would guide through the raid. This would help users who aren't as comfortable with LFG, don't have the friends to play the game, or simply conditions which make interacting on this level difficult.  

I understand that there would have to be some incentive for players to actually *be* guides, as well as good reasoning for experienced players to just not jump into GG instead of going on LFG and finding a group. So, here are a few things I thought could incentivize guides and discourage players who can do the raid 'normally' from abusing the GG System:  
**Encouragement for Guides:**  
* Add some kind of drop rate for Upgrade Materials when guiding guardians, chance increases per additional Guardian in the 'guided' group - Upgrade Modules, Cores, Prisms &amp; even Shards for the final boss would be a great incentive for groups of 6 to drop into guide mode instead of just running a raid regularly.  
* Additional XP, emblems, ornaments, &amp; non-powerful loot to encourage people looking for specific rolls to do so with guided games.  

**Discouragement for people abusing system:**  
* Limit loot from GG to 1 time per account per week per activity. This would at least prevent repeated farming on alt characters. While it would have some impact on genuine GG users, it's a necessary feature to prevent people abusing it imho.  
* Prevent from re-queueing into an activity as a guided player if you already have gotten your loot from, or completed a successful run of that activity that week.   

Additionally, the use of the report system and the 'guardian oath' are a good way of keeping the system overall 'clean' of abusive users on either side.  

I think this, along with some kind of ping system to help non-chat communication, would honestly work perfectly to make Guided Games what it should've been."
1,Why is there a restriction on which pieces of armor can equip elemental well mods? WTF Bungie?,"There are some fun builds I'd like to do with the elemental wells. But, in case you didn't know, any armor from Season of Arrivals and earlier cannot equip these mods.

Not being able to get all the scanners on Europa, or Exo bodies, or Stasis crystals, or these new ones in the Glykkon mission if I want to devote time into it feels awful.

It's especially been awful recently with the release of Beyond Light, where my friends and I played a whole bunch for the first couple weeks but the Seasonal content was just unengaging, so we stopped. Despite the inordinate amount of time we spent after BL dropped, we just weren't allowed to get the collectibles, something we actually had a desire to do, for no real reason. It's disheartening, and the way you're doing it on the Glykkon is even worse.

I also know it's a video game and the collectibles don't matter, but still. It doesn't make me feel rewarded to find the X that marks the spot with a shovel I can only use once a week."

Joe Blackburn tweeted that there is bad luck protection. He left out how much it goes up each week u do it though. I believe this is the case because the drop chance it goes up each week u do it is tiny and that he knew the community would be mad. 

There has been speculation in the community regarding the exact amount it goes up but there is no known number.

If someone at Bungie could just tell us how much it goes up each week I would appreciate it and hopefully get some level of hope that my drop rate is high by now and that i am close to getting it."

1,Make clash default PvP playlist,"I am having so much more fun playing clash today than I ever do playing control. This game has exceptional gunplay and for the first time since stasis arrived it feels gunplay truly has a chance to shine. 

Without an objective there is more freedom to move and engage as you please. You won’t get duskfielded or shatterdived every time you go to cap a zone. Your team won’t get team wiped by a single stasis ability every time you come down the choke point from A to B. If you go off on your own you don’t risk the other team capping all of the zones and running the score up on you for a mercy. I have played for 3 straight hours and haven’t encountered a single mercy. In fact, almost all my games were fairly close games within single digits with more than one coming down to a kill or two at the end. 

Please everyone go play clash and see for yourself. An upvote if you agree is great but the most important way is to play the playlist and show Bungie directly through player engagement."

When i get there says ""Season of the Hunt pass required"" and prompts me to go buy beyond light deluxe edition to get it. so instead of saying well dude give me 1000 silver ( 334$ARS ) and i let you get the weapon. 

Instead i have to pay 1949$ARS to get the only thing i wanted from beyond light because the only way to get the season of the hunt pass is to get the deluxe edition.

So now i have to wait to next dlc to get the weapon from a kiosk (wich i dont like because i like doing quests). 

So my friends and i got screwed, thanks bungie."
1,Returning player after 2+ years who watched a video prior asking still got questions,"Hi. As mentioned in the title I'm a returning player, who played right before Forsaken was released. I played through the campaign and CoO but got bored before doing warmind (Which I will never get the chance to do now sadly). I watched this video which was pretty good in explanations ( [https://youtu.be/Q\_1TLH\_ZyuQ](https://youtu.be/Q_1TLH_ZyuQ) ) but I still have some questions. I also want to add that I don't have any expansion. 

\- Firstly, is there any story-based quests for returning player to get to the soft cap (is it still 1200?) ? Or any other way that isn't just going left and right killing enemies on a map.

\- From the video it seems that D.I.M is a must have, should I get into it right now?

\- My first character is stuffed exo + purple but of course it is only 1100. I read that exo are still viable but should I throw away the rest of my gear when I drop something new? (except if I want to keep it for transmog)

\- About sunset gear, I read that since it couldn't be infused anymore it was safe to delete all of it but better be safe than sorry so I'm still asking about it here

I'm really a normie regarding D2 since I only did the campaign and never got into serious gear stuff like infusion etc, so if you guys have tips or even trustable links I will be grateful."

1,Presage clues (scannables) and data pads,"So Im a bit confused about this topic... I have already completed both normal and master, but I never scanned anything

1. Now if I understand correctly, this week I will only be able to scan the first 5x clues.... after that even if I repeat the quest, I cant scan the following until next weeks reset... is that correct?

2. About the data pads, is it the same? Can I only scan one per week? (i.e. the first one and then second one until next weeks reset) or can I scan all data pads available so far?

Any clarification would be helpful, I’ve been looking around but can find a clear explanation"

1,Omnioculus Nerf Is Very Lame,"With the recent update going invisible via Rat King with Omnioculus equipped no longer gives you Smoke Bomb energy. You still get damage resistance because you are invisible which is nice, but removing the smoke energy gain is the wrong move. I understand fixing the “delay invising yourself” strat to basically give yourself unlimited smokes, but removing the synergy with Rat King is such a buzzkill. Especially when Warlocks get FULL functionality while using Thorn and Necrotic Grip. Bungie even said themselves that they wanted to add more exotic weapon/armor synergies and I thought this was the Hunters turn. I really really hope they revert this change."
1,OG Destiny player jumping back into the grind...,"So I played D1 and D2's original storyline until the grind got to be a little too much. Then I met my wife and fell off the map. Now that I have a baby, I figure some quiet PVE/PVP works for me. 

I'm just wondering... How does one rank up these days? I've been cranking out Vanguard Strikes and Crucible, but I see we can still increase the rep that way? I have 200 exotics in my vault, but do I keep them? I see I can upgrade them but there's a cap now? I stayed subbed here because I had hoped they made the game less of a grind for us casuals, and saw they sunsetted sunsetting... But can anyone ELI5 the armor/masterwork? I was buying engrams from rahool thinking I was decrypting engrams and now Im just so confused. **Jackie Chan Face** help a new first time dad try to get lost in the Destiny world again pleaseeee.

If it's so hard to change things and for what ever reason you can't fix Quality of life or other things then why did you waste precious resources and manpower to change the menu setup for the Recasters, I mean WHY?.

Why not increase vault space, fix the organization if the vault, fix this obsurdly bad loading issue that came with beyond light, why not fix things that we ask to be fixed or updated.


Such an insignificant unnecessary change and a waste of time."
1,Issues with the Lightseeker Triumph (collect all 5 feathers in a single week in the Harbinger activity),Me and my friend have been attempting to get this triumph every week since the feathers have been made available without the quest needed previously.

It persists across runs and even platforms for me, so I assume it’s intentional. has this been happening to anyone else? and what (if anything) does it mean?"

1,FYI - Omnioculus' synergy with Rat King has been patched out.,Rat King invis after a reload no longer grants half a smoke charge - it has no effect on your cooldown anymore. You can't throw your smoke ahead of you and walk into it for a cooldown bump either. Sucks. I grinded pretty hard to get mine and now it feels less useful. You at least still get damage resistance whenever invis. I'm probably just gonna go back to top tree and Sixth Coyote...

1,Can Gambit even be saved?,"Gambit is an ambitious idea that Bungie has all of my respect for trying, but PvEvP is such a delicate mode, that any unbalance will surely destroy it. Gambit was once good(when it launched, maybe only because of hype) and ever since Gambit Prime, Gambit has felt like a chore at its BEST to do.
So I ask the infamous DestinyTheGame community, how will Gambit be saved? Can it even be saved? Should it be saved?"

1,"Seeing 12 man activities was incredible, but for me it felt nice doing Master Nightfalls and Dungeons with the 3 friends that still play the game.","I know that huge fireteams were a blast for many people out there, but personally, I was glad to have an option to play with more friends without leaving 1 person out, or even worse, scheduling a full on raid that more often than not doesn't even happen.

I don't know many people who play D2 still, most of my friends hop on and off every couple seasons, some just gave up entirely. And I do not find it that easy to just lfg raids since my work schedule is so messy. I just like to hop on with a couple of close friends and spent some time in game whenever we get a chance to. Without Menagerie around, there's always somebody who's getting left out since we all mainly do PvE and PvP is getting a but too sweaty and frosty now.

I just wish we could have more activities to do now that the queue glitch is patched out."

1,Male/Female Titan armour,"I have mained exo male titan since D1 launch and I love that guy, but in my opinion all the armour sets that look a little too big or bulky or just odd on male titans seem just right on female titans. For example the Helm of Saint-14. On a male that helmet is just obnoxiously big and clunky, but on females it looks sophisticated and well fitted to the head. Another example is the current season pass chest piece ornament. On the male it makes me look fat but on females it just looks way better. I don't want to scrap my day 1 titan but I much prefer the look of female titans armour :("
1,Dead Man's Tale catalyst quest not showing up on other characters?,"I completed Presage for the first time on my Hunter a few weeks back, then when Master dropped, Zavala gave me the catalyst quest.  Rad.

However, since then, I've been playing more on my Warlock.  I ran regular presage with some friends, got my pinnacle reward and a new roll on DMT, just like you normally would.  What I didn't notice at the time was that I didn't get the catalyst quest on my Warlock.  Then two days ago, I finally got around to running Master Presage.  We completed it with some difficulty, I was excited to get the catalyst to pop, and then... nothing.  I checked my quest inventory and realized I didn't have the quest.  Okay, pretty annoyed that I wasted time suffering through Master only to get nothing out of it, but that's on me for not checking beforehand.  Went back to the tower to talk to Zavala and... he didn't have the quest.  Weird.  Then I realized that I never did the Forsaken campaign on my Warlock, so that map was locked behind the opening mission.  Maybe that's why.  I run the first mission of Forsaken (first few missions actually, just to be sure), the map is open and I can now select Presage from the director.  Zavala still doesn't have the quest for me.  Finally, I run Presage solo.  This should definitely do it.  Nope, still no quest from Zavala.

This has to be a bug, right?  Normally, exotic catalyst quests show up at the vendor as ""abandoned quests"" on your other characters and share progress.  I've been able to pick up where I left off on multiple catalysts after switching characters.  I realize that I can just do Master on my hunter (which is honestly probably for the best since the warlock jump is a fucking nightmare in that mission), but it's annoying that this caused me to miss out on the catalyst from my first Master clear.  Also annoying that Bungie still stubbornly forces you to complete the campaigns on all three characters in order to open up destinations on your alts.  If this is indeed a bug, I'm almost certain that that was the culprit."
1,A potential way to improve the adept system,"A really night idea to improve adept weapons, would be to stop pinnacle level activities dropping adepts. Instead they drop a currency which would function similarly to obsidian radiance from black armory.  


This would be a great improvement, allowing you to make adept any nightfall or trials gear, preventing the non adept versions being complete dismantle fuel, or that awful moment when you get a god roll weapon, but its just missing being adept"
1,Guilded Conqueror can only be worn for 3 weeks until the season ends...,"This needs to change.

With the power increase only going up by 10 season-to-season (aside from yearly expansions), it makes more sense than ever."

1,Lets us purchase character specific ornaments on one character without having to swap to another class.,"It’s an eye-rolling time waster to see in Eververse ornaments I haven’t gotten and need to buy on all 3 of my characters. No it’s not the biggest issue but needing to go through the process 3 times is just wasteful. 

If we can buy all the class specific ornaments on one character that would be a real-time saver. Alternatively if we can purchase Eververse items through the companion app like we can acquire bounties that could also save me from having to swap my character 3-4 times just to buy everything."
1,"If you're trying to get Xenophage, be aware that the Lost Sector puzzles are currently bugged.","I googled this issue and saw other posts about it, but posters in those threads have chalked it up to explosive or unstoppable rounds.  This is not the issue (it might be a separate issue).  The puzzles are bugged (step 2 of The Journey quest).

When I tried doing these puzzles with my fireteam, shooting the first button changed the symbols, but the second button did nothing.  We kept trying the second button for a while, and eventually it changed (after like 3-4 minutes of waiting).  Same for the third and fourth buttons.  We tried this in K1 Logistics and K1 Communion, same issue in both.  When we finally got the fourth button to change and all the symbols matched up, the chest did not spawn. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/qfm2d5D) We waited for like 10 minutes and the chest never spawned.

We tried leaving and retrying the lost sectors, we tried going to orbit and reloading the instance, we tried splitting up and trying solo, the issue still occurred.  We tried using a scout rifle, a sidearm, and even a shotgun.  It wasn't until my friend tried solo using an SMG that it worked.  Then I tried it with a pulse rifle and it worked.  Auto rifles were not tested, but it definitely seems to be an issue with single-shot weapons (though my scout rifle was the full-auto raid scout).  I don't know whether this is a new issue or an old one that never got fixed.  I had done this step of the quest on my Hunter a while back and had no issues, but I don't remember what weapon I was using at the time.

TL;DR - This part of the quest is bugged with multiple weapon types.  The symbols will glitch and fail to change if you're using the wrong weapon type.  The only weapon types I know to work are SMGs and Pulse Rifles.  So SGA: do this step of the quest with a pulse rifle or SMG equipped."

1,No one was asking for the frostbite glitch to be fixed,"In an otherwise really awesome raid, this part is just not very engaging or fun. People glitched it not because it was super hard, but because it was kind of an annoying raid introduction. This is an example of a raid glitch that doesn't really have an adverse effect on the overall difficulty, unlike the garden boss glitch. Its just a bit disappointing that Bungie's team decided this was worth fixing and that it will adversely effect the enjoyment some of my clan mates get out of the raid."

1,"Guided Games 2.0 could simply be 6 raiders plus 1-2 ""ride alongs""","The biggest issue with current Guided Games is that a group of 4 people are matched with 2 people who may or may not know the raid, and may or may not even communicate. Raids generally require active participation from all 6 players, and this is where guided games falls apart pretty quickly and why almost nobody uses the feature.

What is the goal of guided games? My understanding is: 1) to introduce raids to players who have never raided before, and 2) familiarize and teach a raid and it's mechanics to novices.

I am willing to bet that the 12 player raids we have seen over the past few weeks have introduced and familiarized more players to raids than guided games ever has.

# What if, instead of guided games being 4 guides and 2 seekers, it was 6 guides and 2 seekers? 

That way, it's less of a big deal if the seekers aren't fully capable or even cooperative. If raid mechanics only require 6 players, they can dip their toes, take a role is they want to, or just clear adds. Regardless, they get to see the raid and have some degree of first hand experience.

A negative thing I could see happening often is that the seekers just make no attempt to engage with the raid mechanics. Maybe they just kill adds and do some DPS. That's still an upside for a team of 6 raiders who were going to do it anyway.

Also what stops the seeker from triggering wipe mechanics? Nothing, but if a seeker goes full griefer mode then they won't get very far before the guides just leave and do it without them. It's still no worse than 4+2 guided games.

Also if we are concerned about seekers getting easy raid rewards, maybe seekers just get weaker rewards than guides? Such as powerful drops instead of pinnacles. Perhaps the guides recieve bonus Spoils of Conquest?

I previously thought that Guided Games was never going to be able to succeed, but I had never considered extra players as a possibility. After seeing the positive impact that 12 man raids has had on brining ""raid virgins"" into raids, it's pretty clear that this is the best solution to Guided Game's problems.

The solution doesn't have to be perfect, by the way. I'm pretty sure hardcore raiders would not have the patience to add a couple extra ""variables"" to their runs. But I can see a lot of weekend warrior type raiding clans willing to rope in a couple randoms in exchange for some extra rewards. And I can see a LOT of raid newbies using a feature like this to test the waters and eventually be able to say they KWTD."

1,What destiny means to me. by ALI ZIN for SOTR (sorry about the grammar) i’m only 15.,"I’ve played destiny 1 since it came out on xbox. at the time. I was about eight years old. I played with my parents, my father a hunter, my mother a warlock, and me a crayon eating titan. For my 12th birthday, my parents some how got me a solo tour into bungie, and it made me fall in love with the game even more, they were play testing destiny 2 at the time. They showed me the inner workings of bungie, I met cozmo, got a a motherboard of the original halo 2 game (I don’t know how that works). Then I did VOG, it was my only raid completion ever on d1. Sadly, that was the end of my time with d1, I later moved on to d2 and it’s beta. Of course, i was a titan and I loved it. As a fire team (my mom, dad, grandpa, a summer camp counselor, my friend, and I.) We tried to do the leviathan, of course, we failed, at the time, i was young and quite bad at the game. I was able to convince my summer camp counselor and my parents to do a lfg thru destiny. We loaded in, all four of us, with two other dudes who lived across the country in pittsburg. Little did I know they would end up being some of my best friends. We finished the raid, slaying calus and screaming. once the dust and bullet shells settled, my father, finally made a clan called the Shards Of the Traveler. He invited everyone we knew that played, (at the time it was only my grandpa, friends, the dudes we met, and my counselor.) It slowly grew as my  family (fire team fambam) grew closer to the dudes we met and my counselor (fireteam bully). We began to complete raids like it was a thing that noobs do so easily, one in a hour. (which now i know isn’t crazy good). My dad started to get good at crucible, so like father like son, i followed. We got the revoker, recluse, lunas and nf. I played with the same people for three- four years. Almost every day(no i’m not a fat slob, I play a lot of soccer so i’m fit). I grew to know these boys well, and i grew up around them. Over the last year, we were introduced to a new clan mate, a friend of theirs from college, she and my mother immediately connected, both of them being decently bad ( I love you mom). We would play every night from 6 until 9-10pm, we killed gods, guardians, and stasis wielding jerks on europa. I became a hunter, and became really sweaty. I’m now known as the “super sweaty kid” by all of my classmates that play destiny. I’ve grown to be in love with the game, sure stasis sucks, but we can all agree, this game has a vision that if given a chance, can be a truly amazing game. Whether it’s in killing hive gods, becoming flawless in trials, or just doing 12 man nightfalls with clan mates. 

To round this little story up. This game, in a odd way, raised me, from a crayon eating fist slamming titan, to a hunter who at times is reported for using aimbot. (I don’t use it). This is for destiny, my family/my clan; cap, drop pod, skele, ellie, hahn, and zed. I love you all, and for everyone who as sticked with this odd game thru the rough times.

1,12 guardian weekends as an event,"So after the nuttyness of 12 guardian events I understand Bungie patching it out.  However, they cannot deny that a lot of people enjoyed that.  

And it did more than just provide fun times, it opened up access to tougher events (Raids specifically I feel) to people that could just never enjoy that.  

My sister in law is casual at best and just not very skilled.  She cannot raid and struggles with tough content.  However I took her through a 9 guardian garden of salvation and she absolutely loved it.

What I would like to propose Bungie do is make this an event.  Just like triple infamy, or double valor.  12  guardian Fireteam weekend.  They could even disable the raid exotic drop or whatever else, but I think that would be a great fan service type event that Guardians would love."
1,How do I decide which Sword attributes to keep?!,"I've built up a bulk of duplicate legendary swords, Falling Guillotine, Honor's Edge, and Temptation's Hook... I've been comparing them in Destiny Tracker, but I'm still having a hard time trying to decide which versions of each sword I should masterwork based on their perks to provide a good choice for different situations. I'm not familiar enough with their stories either to determine any intended purpose of them.

Any ideas?! I think it'd be good to have one for hoard mode (lots of small enemies around), another for big boss mode (lots of big enemies around, or for a big tough one), and another for... I'm not sure... generating class ability?!

What have you done for masterworking swords? I'm kind of scratching my head on godrolls for each one... and I don't want to masterwork something that just looks great."
1,Conquerors are getting the shaft.,"So all 3 other titles available for Gilding get them week 1 if you grind enough. Conquerors? nah fam, you can wait until the end of the season, then show it off for 3 weeks. Then the season resets, and you are back to square one. 

Honestly, thats dog shit. For first time conquerors, sure, gotta do em all. For those of us that have been doing them for seasons on end? Should be a few additional challenges, and you should be able to get them as soon as the rest. 

On a side note, would be great to not save the only decently challenging content until a month after launch too. if people arent leveled, there not gonna go into GM's, but some of us do want to go in them earlier, or even under light for a challenge, let us do that if we want. 

Sorry for the salt, Im generally super positive, but after grinding out the subclass challenge, only for the triumphs to do each nightfall after the fact to pop up once i claimed it, tilted me off the edge."

1,Old Guardian Games Ghost Shells Locked and Removed When Swapped Out,"It appears that Bungie has accidentally locked the Ghost shells from last year's Guardian Games behind the condition of needing 350 Laurels to activate each of them. If you had one in your inventory, it will not load and will be removed from your character when you try to swap it. If you masterworked any of them, I recommend not swapping them around so that the materials you spent masterworking aren't essentially thrown away. If you had one equipped, you'll still have a functioning Ghost, but you'll have no perks active and be subject to looking at the burned, beat up default Ghost shell for a while (provided you don't swap shells). New versions pulled from collections will display the 350 Laurels price. New versions can be upgraded, but they cannot be equipped."

1,"Hey Bungie, please don't take away my gilded Conqueror after only being able to wear it for a couple weeks.","I like doing grandmasters and getting Conqueror was super fun last season, but as of right now, since you can't do every grandmaster until almost the end of the season, you can't earn gilded Conqueror until you only have 2-3 weeks to wear it. The other gilded titles could all be earned within the first week and worn for almost the whole season!

I'd even settle for just making all the grandmasters available when the first one launches as opposed to making us wait multiple weeks. At least then super dedicated players can go after the gild and have more time to wear it. And again, this wouldn't be a problem if title gilding didn't reset at the end of the season, but as of right now, you just don't get that long with it."

1,Grandmaster nightfall,If you are below 1325 I assume you can't attempt the grandmaster nightfall?
1,I have a theory about the Proving Grounds Strike coming in a week.,"Spoiler cuz of the new lore, and in case I am right (probably unlikely)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so in the new Lore book, it goes over Zavala's decision to challenge to Cabal to a Rite of Proving to put a conclusion to the Battlegrounds. Caiatl says ""We'll put forth Ignovun as our champion... inside the Halphas Electus. We'll see how much Light the smallmen have once they fight their way inside.""

Two things here, I'm pretty sure the Halphas Electus is the big-ass tank on Nessus, but that's literally only because I don't even know what else it could be. We're fighting our way inside eventually, so it makes sense to me. Second, is this; ""**We'll see how much Light the smallmen have** once they fight their way inside.""

&amp;#x200B;

You know how the Cabal have developed Light disrupting tech? What if they took that and put it into a much larger, Cabal scale? Like an intentional trap to secure victory by taking away our Light for the Rite of Proving? What if the boss fight of the Proving Grounds Strike doesn't allow us to use our abilities, at all? Like the Red War?

&amp;#x200B;

After looking over the Season of the Chosen trailer, I never saw an ability used inside the tank at all. This could easily be a coincidence, but I think it's possible that Proving Grounds will strip our light from us once more, making it a little more ""equal"" fight. Of course, this is all speculation, but I don't really see why this couldn't happen. Plus it would make the strike really unique and much more of a challenge, something that is to determine the fate of the Cabal Empire should probably be."
1,Ghost Shell Not Loading and Gone When Swapped,"When I loaded in for the first time after the reset, my ghost shell wouldn't load on my character screen. When I landed in the HELM, I pulled my ghost out and it showed the default, burned and destroyed shell instead of what should have been my Rival Titan Shell. When I went back into my character screen, I saw that my shell still hadn't loaded. Curious about what was happening, I changed shells to one of the extra ones I had (all of which had loaded). The slot for my Rival Titan Shell then just disappeared. My shell is gone - not in my postmaster, vault, or on another character. Did this happen to anyone else's ghost shell? If so, did you find your shell anywhere?"
1,Will raids be in the seasonal challenges?,I'm a solo player who has never raided in D2. LFGing a raid group is not something I feel like doing. Seeing the GM Nightfall in it isn't great either.
1,"Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm gonna miss the 12 man fireteam glitch and so will you","This glitch will go down in Destiny history as one of the wackiest exploits the game has ever known; one so great that Bungie themselves acknowledged its existence and allowed us time to play around with it. Instead of immediately putting it down, they allowed us to go nuts with it in good spirits.

It's a bittersweet ending to the legend, but I'm happy we got it in the first place."

Considering in D1 TTK adept weapons had a variation of Celerity built in, I literally see nothing op or wrong about having these built in and it feels like a regression from D1 -&gt; D2."

1,Let's us keep 12/6 man raids/dungeons,"Okay so we can all agree that running actives with too many guards was fun as hell. I know 12 man can be a stretch especially on previous gen consoles but you could restrict it to 8/9 on previous gen.


Anyway here's my idea with scaling rewards with fireteams.


 If you're in a fireteam of 3/6 you can unlock all triumphs and pinnacles and loot drops fully masterworked (maybe 7/8 for armour) for your first run maybe a huge chunk of glimmer and upgrade materials. Exotics/cosmetics will also only drop in a fireteam of 3. High chance of high roll amour (80%).

However if you have 3+/6+ you only get base power weapon and armour. No materials no spoils, heck no access to rerolling thing. Low chance of high stat amour (20%)

Contest mode is only for the correct sizes.

I think this strikes the right balance of loot/fun/team sizes."

I did not however buy shadowkeep. So all in all I played D2 main story and Forsaken and haven't played the game since. 

Fast forward to now, I load up the game and start a new character and find myself confused thinking I just started D1. I was in the cosmodrome after being revived, I follow where it tells me to go seeing little differences and then finally meet up with the guy with the bones on his arm and he gives me a sniper rifle. I decide to check my map, I somehow have a ship, I did not start the game in a huge battle, there was no walking wounded through the city, no farm, just like I was thrown into an already established game.  I decide to travel to the tower and everyone is just there, cade is already dead, suraya is there just hanging out and some planets are missing.

Between win trading, out of bounds glitches, and other various technical issues, the game mode has shown to be broken. Bungie didn't want to roll it out half baked. That goal was not accomplished. They pulled trials of the nine out of the game because they thought the mode was doing damage to their competitive pvp brand, and probably didn't want to maintain it anymore. Is the temperature in the room that they should continue weekly trials and play whack-a-mole to fix whats going on now or that they give it a season or two off and roll out sweeping changes to try and get it right?"

My next thought was let me get a fun build to use, I go through youtube and look for some builds alot of them seem kinda uninteresting or old but I came across this one titan build with like divinity and powerful friends with the hailing confusion. And I go great i'll use this it looks fun as fuck. But I get deeper into the video and I am missing some of the mods. Specifically Radiant Light and Swift Charge. Ever since I saw that video I go to banshee everyday at reset and pray that he atleast will bring one of them especially swift charge since I love using sidearms,submachine gun, and pulses. the thing that gives me the greatest amount of despair was just the fact that I missed it. It's not a raid gun or something that comes with random rolls so I can't complain about bad rng it was an accessable mod from the gunsmith. There is no quest no nothing all I had to do was just give him 10 mod components. I was originally one of those people who didn't get warmind cells or CWL mods so I just ignored them. Now I'm sitting here biting the bullet. I know I didn't mention a warmind cell mod in this post but they're just so good honestly atleast the last 3 days banshee has sold 3 good ones back to back."

But people really need to be educated on war mind cells. Ever since the silent nerf of reactive pulse, I've changed my build and tried using a war mind cell build with Wrath of Rasputin and Burning cells with Sunshot. And I love it! It's honestly so much fun to use. But, anytime I load into strikes or battlegrounds, my randoms will shoot and destroy them. Now if they have war mind mods equipped then by all means shoot it. But I've inspected the ones who have destroyed them and they have no mods equipped, meaning the cells will not do anything. And it's infuriating. 

Idk maybe there should be a change to them where you can't interact with them without a war mind cell mod on. I've just been really excited to finally try out this build, and I haven't been able to interact with the cells before a fellow random decides to destroy it.

1,The Shelter from the Storm glitch has been fixed,"It isn't mentioned in the patchnotes, but I'm pretty sure it has been fixed."
1,Can we just rename this season to “Season of War Crimes”?,"Because between the attempted assassination of Zavala, and Calus kidnapping scorn and dissecting them for experiments, I thought things were getting wild.... 

But Saladin.... oh boy Saladin. Giving no quarter to fleeing Cabal, saying we should attempt our own assassination of Caitl, and the darkest one yet.... suggesting we kidnap Psions and hook them up to Vex Prediction Engines and use Warlock magic to forcibly invade their minds to make them create false tactical scenarios to feed to Cabal leadership....


I mean for a man so stuck up about the Cabal having no “honor”, I wouldn’t be surprised to hear him suggesting we go find the Cabal ships carrying their civilians and blowing it up.

1,"Finally got my Cursebreaker title but have not yet got the ""Seal the Deal"" achievement, what gives?","So after months of waiting I FINALLY got my Cursebreaker title and was hoping to finally see that ""Seal the Deal"" cheevo pop but so far it has not yet, i've heard some stories about this achievement not appearing until after restarting the game or something like that, is that still true?  I'd hate to get screwed out of this cheevo for no reason at all after all the hard work I put in."
1,Season of the Chosen challenges,So one of season challenges on week 6 is to commplete Nightfall: the ordeal on grandmaster difficulty. I'm the only one who thinks it's too difficult for season challenges?
1,"It's been fun, but I'm out after how the past few months have played out.","Done with and uninstalled Destiny 2. They banned our clan leader right before Christmas with no explanation and zero response from customer support, our clan pretty much all stopped playing out of solidarity with him. Since then we've tried for several months to get any sort of response from Bungie with nothing coming back, and the community as a whole has been *completely unhelpful and incredibly rude*.

For something I spent over a thousand hours and several hundred dollars on, I can't help but feel like I wasted my time giving this game a try, and very much so wasted my time custom-building my new gaming rig themed around WarMind; at least the latter is something I can easily change.

It's funny to think that just a few months ago I posted how much I was enjoying the game and its community, and how quickly that enthusiasm soured with the immediate ostracizing our group received.

I already know the majority of the kind of responses I'm going to get to this, so keep it to yourself if you're going to comment with some QQ crap. Maybe some of you will prove me wrong.

All we wanted was an answer to 'why?' and an opportunity to prove it was a wrongful ban, and everyone from forum users to community managers has come back with nothing but negativity and utter childishness, along with complete silence on Bungie's part. I worked for many years on MMO's as a dev, and I would be sorely disappointed in the team I worked with if they'd handled things this poorly.

And to the mods, seriously, screw you guys if you delete this post like you did the last time I posted about this when I was asking for assistance. I'm beyond asking for help at this point as everyone has shown they don't give a fuck."
1,Bungie has stealth the frostbite glitch in the raid.,Heres hoping someone will find a new way to make farming that first chest as easy as it once was
1,Could a Dev explain why Crimson was created instead of adding Red Death back into the game?,"I’m genuinely curious. Bungie does have a thing for exotic hand cannons—there are more exotic hand cannons than any other primary weapon type, by far (there is even Eriana’s Vow, a special ammo exotic hand cannon!).

The only reason I can think of is that they wanted to reuse some of the same ideas, but wanted to differentiate D2 from D1 during the early days. Chain lightning and lifesteal are both very common abilities found in many different video games.

Zhalo Supercell becoming Riskrunner makes a lot of sense to me. They promote sub machine guns, a new archetype, by creating a new exotic sub machine gun that echoes an old favorite with a new twist. Everyone also loves chain lightning.

But for Crimson...I just don’t get it. It’s basically a living meme considering Bungie’s over emphasis on exotic hand cannons.

Crimson is unique in the sense that it was the first ever burst handcannon (later we got the DOA Warden’s Law in Forsaken), but it just seems super gimmicky since it literally is just a 3 round burst that also heals the user.  The catalyst also just boosts the range...not too exciting. At least Riskrunner offers some unique perks.

Riskrunner feels like a spiritual successor to Zhalo while Crimson just feels like a gimmicky ripoff (no offense to Crimson fans).

It’s not like Red Death was broken or wasn’t iconic enough. It was a fan favorite, and even was able to hang somewhat before the peak of hand cannons dominance in D1.

Since Red Death was a pulse rifle that LOOKED LIKE an Auto Rifle...maybe the devs wanted to make Crimson a pulse that looked like an exotic handcannon? The problem is Crimson isn’t a pulse, it’s a handcannon, and the bullets damage are calculated oddly.

Again...I’m not bashing Crimson outright. But I am immensely curious as to its origins. Red Death was a PVP favorite in D1, and it also was incredible useful in Crota’s End to bypass Crota’s antihealing. Red Death also just looks super bad ass, has a really cool name, and had a reputation as “the banned Vanguard weapon”. We even got Crimson Spectre legendary auto rifles exclusive to Crucible, which was was really cool since Red Death originates from a modified auto rifle frame.

TL;DR I doubt it will happen, but it would be really cool for Bungie to explain why Crimson was created as opposed to bringing back Red Death. Since Crimson exists, I don’t think Red Death ever will come back, which imho, is a damn shame."
1,What are some good heavys for master nightfalls?,Usually I run eriana’s vow with either a machine gun or rocket launcher but are there any specific heavys I should get for the master nightfalls?
1,Removing parts of Forsaken to make it “less confusing” for new players actually makes the game more confusing and shallow for new players.,"I know this definitely won’t change Bungie’s decision but I seriously can’t understand how removing content would make things less confusing for new players.

I remember when I came back during Season of Arrivals I was very confused about a lot of things story wise (and gameplay wise tbh), I was even more confused after I played through Forsaken and was told that Uldren Sov will be coming back in Beyond Light. Turns out it’s because I missed 1 cutscene from one of the previous seasons that showed him getting resurrected. 

One of my friends got into D2 and I basically had to explain to him everything whenever we played since he wasn’t able to finish the Red War campaign to top it all off he was showing some interest in buying Forsaken. I have another friend who is willing to give D2 a try but she’s dependent on the story, well that’s great because uh...there’s no story for her that helps establish this game.

If you want to talk about confusing you have the Presage quest. In order to start it you have to go to the Arms Dealer strike, which is narrated by Cayde, to pick up something and then in the quest you could possibly head Cayde’s voice who is ...supposed to be dead. Doesn’t this contradict the current story? (No please don’t take out the strike)

Without the Red War Campaign and Leviathan raids season of the Chosen can be confusing as well and I don’t understand what’s wrong with letting players advance the story at their own pace?

tl;dr: removing content just makes the game more confusing to new players just put a quick recap for major events?"
1,Nectar Dynamo For Sale! I repeat! NECTAR DYNAMO FOR SALe,never sold last season
1,So I got an 1100 power Tigerspite last night,[removed]
1,Dark quest overlay on postmaster?,"Everytime I speak to the postmaster I have a dark overlay like when you have quest dialogue or something. I can't actually access my post until I back out, like you would a quest screen. Is this a known issue? Tried relogging and it's still there."
1,12 Man Lightless Activity Idea + Extras,"Imagine a mode with no abilities only guns. This might put less strain on the game and allow for people to engage in this large scale activity.  I also think the enemy would be 1 giant boss with simple mechanics. 

But to keep this mode fun, I suggest throwing in 1 or 2 drake tanks, areas that requires sparrow, cabal and fallen vehicles(ie pikes), the turret from destiny 1, and artifacts (ie scorch cannons, hive sword, valkyrie). Maybe this would make it fun, while also not allowing us to use abilities.

So long as not everyone is using trinity ghoul and telesto we should be good."
1,How does one do grandmaster nightfalls??,By this I mean.... Is 1325 power level any good?
1,"The words ""Grandmaster"" and ""Trials"" do not belong anywhere in the weekly seasonal challenges.","While in general this new system is a positive thing, we have already seen they are of course going to ""Bungie it up."" The remaining challenges have been datamined, and most of them suck. Badly.

Grandmaster NF have a ridiculous barrier to entry. How many players will even get to a high enough level to *even launch it?*

Trials is a complete shitshow. Bungie needs to fix it before requiring it for *anything.*

These activities not having matchmaking should also automatically disqualify them from inclusion. Comp was bad enough, but at least we have the freelance playlist.

My suggestion: Just take the ""L"" on this right out of the chute. Auto complete these for all players, and learn from the mistake for future seasons."

1,Rat king no longer refunds melee energy on invis proc with omnioculus per patch 3.1.1 Discussion,"Title.  When reloading after a kill pre-patch you would receive half of a smoke  bomb charge as well as granting the resist buff while invisible. Post  patch you can no longer gain melee energy on the rat king perk proc, as  well as you can no longer gain melee energy by throwing a smoke ahead of  you and running into it.

Personal  side note: As a nightstalker main, I'm really disappointed by this, the  build had so much going for it synergy wise, like warlocks with  necrotic grip and thorn. It finally made rat king a viable weapon for  endgame content  and it just got neutered, the resistance on rat king is  nice I guess but compared to some other options like izanagis or  divinity, it's not worth it."
1,Omnioculus has gone from niche to unusable in one patch,"The rat king + invis dodge synergy was a fun and unique build and now it’s useless for pvp and just straight up boring everywhere else

I get it was bugged but if it ain’t bugged, don’t fix it

1,"Did you know that simply hits, not kills, with a Lasting Impression rocket will trigger Ambitious Assassin? (Rocket Launchers)","I acquired a Heretic, Aggressive Frame, rocket launcher. With it came Ambitious Assassin and Lasting Impression. After running some tests I determined that the triggers for an Ambitious Assassin reload is either multiple kills with the rocket, or hitting a single target with a Lasting Impression rocket. The Trait description does not mention this. Bear in mind, that having two 2 rockets in a magazine does not change this fact. Still, only one of these two rockets needs to hit an enemy before reloading to trigger Ambitious assassin.

While this may not be a game changer for ad clearing, given the difficulty of direct hits on smaller targets, this does provide the opportunity to unload 7+ rockets in a matter of seconds, which makes for huge burst damage potential.

My first and obvious choice is to use Sealed Ahamkara's Grasp, but there are many other exotic combos I'm sure. Ranged melees still trigger this reload, so Stasis SC with dodge to reload melee can work very well. 

You can hit a target, use first melee, fire off 2 more rockets, dodge to reload a single melee back, use melee again, fire off 2 more rockets, use final melee, fire off 2 rockets.

If you're feeling really bold, you can start off the combo sequence with an uncharged melee. The delay on Lasting Impression should allow you enough time to get to a safe distance before the first rocket explodes. If performed successfully, this sequence will fire off a total of 9 rockets, which is the exact number of reserves on a Heretic rocket launcher with 2 rocket launcher scavenger perks on.

Best of luck to anyone farming the rocket launcher from Altars of Sorrow"

I just want to know if it still works."
1,Can we get a rework for Apotheosis Veil?,"I think it's fair to say that this exotic is hot trash compared to most other exotic armour pieces in game. It is tied to super ability only and I have never seen anyone wear it in any activities I play because there are so many better options to use.

1,Can somebody tell me what exactly I have to do,Can somebody explain how this Polaris lance catalyst works exactly? I get kills with the explosion and I get no progress towards the 50 kills what am I doing wrong?
1,"Bungie, the Dreadnaught in The Witch Queen is a must have!","I think the Dreadnaught would be a amazing side location in The Witch Queen DLC, the [Road to Witch Queen](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50124) revealed they are delaying the release to early 2022 instead of late 2021 to give them enough time to work. 

The Dreadnaught has all this going for it

1.  fan-favorite location with gobs and gobs of hidden collectibles and challenges New Light and Veteran players alike probably haven't gone through yet. 
2. Rich lore on the Hive and the 3 Sisters (Oryx, Xivu-Arath, Savathun) which is relevant to the expansion as well as being interesting and slightly horror themed which the community has shown they like recently with Presage. 
3. Has strikes which with a few new voice lines could be perfect as they are already great and have strike specific rewards which again the community likes. (Much like S.A.B.E.R in the Cosmodrome)
4. &gt;! Connection to the Cabal (Calus/Ghaul) in the crashed ship!&lt; which is a huge factor of D2 with Cabal being relevant from 2017-2021 with the Red legion, the Leviathan, the Glykon, Caiatl  and more. &gt;!as well as being a perfect way to continue the Hive/Cabal line that has just begun with Xivu Araths destruction of Torbatl !&lt;
5. Chance to get the New Light guardians up to speed with the Taken/Hive going into the campaign
6. Repeatable activities, patrols, public events, transmat zones, lost sectors, and more
7. Tons of potential armor, sparrows, ghost shells, shaders, weapons, exotics, quests.
8. One of the if not THE best Raid in Destiny history that can be brought back much like VoG
9. Fits into the lore, The ship is just sitting in orbit right now. No changes or events that need to be explaine, its just...there
10. Way to satisfy the (Oryx is coming back?!?!?) and (Oryx in D2?!?!?!) and (Oryx's worm on Titan?!?!) conspiracy theorists

And Best of all, Its already done. With new graphics and voice lines as well as tweaks here and there the dreadnaught is a treasure trove of Lore, Loot, and potential just sitting there. The Cosmodrome proved these ""renovations"" can be done, Its a fast easy way to bring a amazing chunk of D1's history to the presence as well as a way to save time and effort on production instead of building a whole new planet/place from scrap.

I just thought of this when I saw the Dreadnaught in saturns rings while watching a old video about Titan, What do you guys think about this? Anything you would like to see return/left out? Might be a silly idea that is unrealistic but the taken king was my favorite DLC to date and I really want to see it return someday in some form."

1,Nerfing/Fixing Omnioculus was a Mistake,"Fixing Omnioculus was a mistake.  The exotic does 3 things:

* Grants 2 smoke bombs.  
* Makes you take less damage while invis 
* Gives you smoke back when you turn an ally invis. 

That makes it THE exotic of choice for Pathfinders (bottom tree) in PVE.  But of limited use to other trees or in PVP.  

Players quickly noticed 2 other functions:
1. Going invis through ""other means"" (besides bottom tree smoke) also returned a significant amount of smoke charge - This included using the exotic weapon Rat King.
2. Running into smoke ""late"" on bottom tree had the same effect.

This ""unintended"" behavior made the exotic extremely valuable in both PVE and PVP for all 3 classes of Nighstalker.  Having a high uptime on smokes to slow Crycoclasm Titans with Felwinters was *helpful*.  Not even close to meta or broken--just kind of a fun thing to try to spec into.  It still wasn't as strong as Withering Blades or Duskfield Grenades.  

Last week, in the TWAB, Bungie acknowledged that the unintended behavior was a bug, but their promised fix left some room for doubt as to how badly the exotic would be nerfed:  ""Omioculus also no longer grants melee energy when making only yourself invisible under some circumstances. ""  it's an ambiguous sentence, but I maintained hope that only some circumstances were being fixed (The bottom tree late-invis bug seemed like a prime candidate).

It was the first thing I tested this mornng after the update, and sure enough ALL of the cool behaviors are gone.  Rat King no longer has any synergy.  Top and Middle tree no longer gain any smoke charge on dodge.

Top tree Nighstalker is a subclass that needs help right now.  I really don't think nerfing unintended benfits to a weak subclass was the right choice."

Quote:  

&gt;We wanted to share a change coming to Seals and Titles in Season 13. As I'm sure you've noticed, we've been shipping a Flawless and Conqueror Title each of the last three Seasons. We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!    
As always, we start with the goals:   
&gt;  
&gt;Allow players to show off their engagement with the core rituals season over Season.   
&gt;  
&gt;Preserve the value of earning the base Title.   
&gt;  
&gt;Decrease the amount of grind required Season over Season for players that want to earn them all. 

Yet as seen on [braytech.org](https://braytech.org) that the requirements for Conqueror Gilded is to do all 6 (seen here on my profile: [https://braytech.org/2/4611686018428608568/2305843009264934121/triumphs/seal/3776992251](https://braytech.org/2/4611686018428608568/2305843009264934121/triumphs/seal/3776992251))

this means you will only be able to Gild Conqueror 3 weeks before the end of the season. Meanwhile, Trials/Gambit/Unbroken could have been achieved since Week 1.

It was so much easier to see everything on one screen. That made so much more sense so I can only assume that this change was not intended.

This is admittedly not a gamebreaking bug, just an annoyance."

This ""issue"" has been around for 5+ weeks now. How does it take them this long to adjust the damage of a single weapon when this type of change is one of the most common changes they make. People say that its some sort of bug 1. they never said that 2. then why isnt it in the know issues list? The only thing they said concering this issue is that a damage reduction was unintetended but the damage against bosses is still basically the same the only thing that really changed was the damge ""bonus"" against non boss targets so they didnt nessecarly have to have lied when they implied that they would fix any uninteded damage reduction bc when you just look at boss damage there technically wasnt a damage reduction so there is nothing to fix.

1,"Motes Need to Stop ""Falling"" Through the Ground","Bungie, it has been 2.5 years since Gambit has been introduced and still to this date, motes keep falling through the ground and are not obtainable. I can understand every once and a blue moon a mote will phase through the ground, but almost every game now I cannot collect motes. It can be frustrating after killing a high value target almost fall the motes fall through the ground. Gambit was always marketed as a new great core activity but we have not seen any new maps in years and even lost several due to them being vaulted. Please fix and improve Gambit. Use Dredgens need to bank those motes!"
1,My extremely fun warlock build,"My extremely fun warlock build that, while not being too overpowered, is very fun:

&amp;#x200B;

Loadout:

Top tree dawnblade with strafe glide for celestial fire

Claws of ahamkara for double celestial fire

Max strength for quicker recharging

Monte Carlo for quicker recharging and a chance to completely recharge

2 weapons for yellow bars

&amp;#x200B;

How to use:

Use celestial fire on EVERYTHING while in the air, even if you only kill one enemy with it each time, you will get 2 and wait a couple seconds and you will get another.

If you run out of charges, use Monte Carlo on a couple of red bars to get your celestial fire back.

If you encounter something that doesn't have a red/orange health bar, use your other weapons as celestial fire doesn't do enough damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

This is especially fun with brawler/solar singe on the strike rotation.

Sadly, celestial fire doesn't do splash damage so no warmind cells."

1,Destiny 2 Unplayable (steam),"In the last couple months, for some reason Destiny 2 refuses to run properly. At some point the game began to consistently drop frames and crash. At first it was an issue of connecting to servers, but as a D1 player I was use to the copious amounts of error codes and server drops. Then after a while the frame drop and crashing began and has only increased since. At the start of it I was able to relaunch and load as a different character then swap back, but this no longer works. Normally it will allow me to load the character and stay in orbit, but the moment I try to launch anything, the game begins the afore mentioned issues. This is the only game that I have that acts this way, I have also tried verifying the files and reinstalling, but this did not change anything. I haven't been playing the last month or so because of this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

1,Is Dragonfly spec essential/any good?,"Hi Everyone, 

Hoping that I can save myself some time and sanity by leveraging the community instead of testing it myself. Is there actually a boost from dragonfly spec? I've seen posts that it has not increased damage or distance, but am hoping that this was fixed. Does anyone have any experience or links to videos that could help explain?"
1,"4-12 person Nightfalls etc. could work, with some loot and achievements restrictions.","Okay, over rewarding events can destabilize a games overall balance.  I get it.  Once one area (such as 12 person NFs) is more rewarding, people will gravitate more toward that event, especially if it’s beneficial to do so.  This could cause population issues in other instances/events.

But as far as large fireteams are concerned, let’s face it Bungie, you opened a can of worms that can never be put back.  Almost anyone who participated had a blast.

So, how would a compromise look going forward?

An initial compromise would probably be “only drop rewards for the intended amount of players”.  So, if it is a nightfall, the rewards would be capped randomly at 3 persons.  This, 12 people, 6 people, or whatever, would share the loot of 3 people.  Etc.

Also, the runs should not count toward normal achievements.  For instance, a “flawless Presage” should not count if it was done in 4 or more people.  

I could also see changing the point requirements to 200k points needed for 4+ players, etc.

Thoughts?"
1,Omnioculus: Melee eneregy only when making allies invisible,"Looks like the update to Omnioculus has reduced the melee energy gains to only when your smoke bombs make an ally invisible. Making yourself invisible -- whether via smoke bomb or Rat King -- returns no melee energy.

1,Season of the Hive/Taken Love Anyone?,"Apologies for the long post incoming. Just excited/curious:

I'm sure some of you have recently seen the outpouring of support and love for SIVA in the last few days with Plague Gang, and Season of the Plague. In all honesty I didn't know people had such a deep love for the...concept(?). My question is, despite knowing that Season of the Hunt was arguably Hive focused and Witch Queen will more than likely focus on the Hive/Taken, why haven't we gotten Seasons dedicated to our Sword Logic loving boys and girls? 

I can only imagine the Season leading up to Witch Queen will focus on them and as said before, so will the expansion, but what do you guys think of the Hive having a run at a Season? I think Steeplechase was a good step in the right direction, but I've found it odd that besides Shadowkeep, armor sets and Hive weapons have been somewhat scarce? Only some of the weapons from Shadowkeep have Hive-like crust and mold on them, while the rest I'd argue look more in line with Eris Morn's pattern of armor/weapons. My fear is that the set we saw a few weeks back in the State of the Game looked more Eris inspired than say the sets we got in Kings Fall and Crota's End. If I'm honest...those sets from KF and CE are S tier, and I'd much rather have something look closer to that.

I'm not looking to bash armor design or anything, just curious if people are hungry for anything Hive related. I can understand if it's played out a bit with D1 being very Hive focused with Taken King and Crota's End, and so perhaps there is an oversaturation, but it seems weird that throughout the life span of D2, Hive focused content has been sparse. Just looking from vanilla D2 to what we have now, there are at least three Vex armor sets (the GoS set, the ornaments, and the Season of the Undying armor/ornaments), many, many Cabal sets that ranged from across the Leviathan raids, to even this Season, and more than a few Fallen sets (arguably the bulk of the Forsaken gear, which was also Awoken inspired).

And this isn't just armor sets or weapons I'm talking about, I also just mean lore wise. There's so much about the Hive that is fascinating *\*makes startling Toland noises\*.* And yet theres so much to explore. Like we still have no idea what Savathun's forces look like, despite her having a hold on the Taken. Xivu Arath is more than likely getting close to the system given her play in Season of the Hunt, and the idea that she's at war with her sister is just.....awesome. There's so much untapped story potential that Witch Queen is going to have, just thinking about it is....bone chilling. 

Hell, even the aesthetic is great. Shadowkeep is basically space Barad-Ur. I can't tell you how often I go to the moon just to explore the catacombs, because there is literally nothing else like it in the game *\*wishes for the return of the Dreadnought\**. There's a lot of Hive stuff coming I have no doubt, but compared to what we have its just so...little. This is especially evident as we look to potential alliances with both Fallen and Cabal, which would in theory only leave the Vex, Hive/Taken, and Scorn left (I do have a theory that the next saga of Destiny could potentially open up to players playing as these races as well as our current cropping of humans, Exo, and Awoken. Like you could play as a ""saved"" Hive that has reverted back to Krynn(?), Kryll(?), etc.).

I'd wager next Season could be Vex focused given the return of the Vault of Glass and Ikora's return to prominence as well as the previously mentioned final Season leading to Witch Queen being potentially Hive/Taken focused (but who knows?). 

So yeah, what do you guys think? Is SIVA more inspired because its been inactive for sometime? Would you like a Hive/Taken Season? Or is it played out, etc. Let me know below, just thought it'd be a cool conversation to have.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Thoughts on a Hive/Taken focused Season? What kind of armor sets/weapons would be cool? Is it played out? Or would you rather have a season of SIVA etc."
1,Guess that Arc Singe Strikes just wont exist ever now...,"Void, Solar, Void, Solar, Void, Solar...

Seriously Bungie. You FINALLY give Titans something which lets them do massive boss damage, and you wont let us have fun with it..."
1,WITH THE RELEASE OF TRANSMOG WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE OUR GUARDIANS APPEARANCE...,"I searched and searched for someone else to say this, but I found nothing so I figured I’m the one to post about it. 

Idk about you guys but I’d love the option to be able to edit the look of 2 of my guardians. I think it would be a good addition to be able to swap facial features, race (exo awoken human) gender, etc. It would just provide more freedom in customization instead of being stuck with the goofy warlock face I made as a teenager. 

Let me know what your thoughts are..."

   * Players will now be refunded Cabal Gold when swapping Challenger Medallions.

* Fixed an issue where completing the Ouroborea Ascendant Challenge wouldn't grant the Triumph for completion.

##Platforms and Systems 



* Added quick launch Activity Cards for PlayStation 5. 
* Fixed and issue where some users were missing friends or clan members in their roster on PlayStation 5. 


##General 



* Fixed an issue where players would see incorrect spaceflight transitions when launching certain maps during Iron Banner or Trials of Osiris.
* Fixed an issue where players with their Ghost out while scanning an object will instead summon their Sparrow. 
* Fixed an issue where players were able to cram 12 people into activity that clearly couldn’t handle the might of that many Guardians."
1,Sunsetting sunsetting was a start now try this Bungie...,"The sun set on sunsetting and I'm thankful. But I think design wise Bungie still has the question in their collective minds; how do we keep the game fresh?

Well I can't help but notice that each season the champion mods drive my loadouts. Subtle changes that effect how I play champion based content like Nightfalls and Lost Sectors. 

But this has me thinking the seasonal artifact is key. Can we find a way to make those seasonal mods even more effective to overall gameplay?

What about a skill tree, what about specializing in say crucible or gambit specific mods that define the PVP part of the game the way champion mods do for PVE?

I think this eliminates the need to ever consider sunsetting again and move to meaningfully manipulate player builds in game. 

Thanks."

#Notable Armor Rolls

*Only notable rolls (stat total &gt;= 58 or single stat &gt;= 26) are listed here.*"
1,Is it me or do Armors kind of look really uninspiring? Even the Eververse ones?,"Title. I recently caught up to end game on my Titan and Warlock and while going through Fashion stuff for Transmog and stuff in the future I kinda realized Warlock armor and most Titan armor kind of suck...even the paid cosmetics. Hunters have nice ones and all but....  


Armor design kind of really just doesn't look good right now and I don't see the point in Transmog when there aren't any chase cosmetics / ornaments"
1,So Vorpal weapon is no longer a PVP fave?,"Just asking, it had some high regard for fighting supers but now seems like nobody wants it anymore, what happened?"
1,High Man Activities for the Future,"Since the 12-man raid bug is getting patched today, I'd just like to say it was super fun. I also think the general consensus of the community is that these 12-man activities were quite fun. Bungie should take note of the wide acceptance and utilization of this glitch, because people didn't just use it because it made content super easy, but because it gave the content a very fresh feel. There is definitely potential for high-man activities to be implemented in the future, maybe as a seasonal activity, or a whole new core playlist.

1,"I want to take my friend through Destiny, but there’s a huge chunk missing, and its awkward","So my friend wants to play through Destiny with me. We’ll start with D1, where I will likely have to add much commentary up till Taken King to ensure she’s not completely lost in the sauce, but then I realized when we get to D2, I wont just have to explain, I’ll have to freaking tell the story myself. A story that I PAID Bungie to be the ones to tell and play through. 

I hated sunsetting before, but now I’m thinking we deserve refunds or have it put back in for free, not as part of a season pass or DLC. I’ll take the longer loading times. Or just put out a D3.

I did not agree to have content taken away from me, except by acquiescence and now I don’t get to take my friend through the story from beginning to end because Bungie wants to resell me stories I already paid for. 

This practice needs to stop. It’s not right. “It’s a broken system.” If the game is getting too big, then put out a Destiny 3. People will wait. But taking AWAY content cannot happen any more."

These emblems are something more to chase after when doing Last Wish that sadly other raids after it do not have. It would be super cool if you got a unique emblem for doing all the challenges in Garden of Salvation and Deep Stone crypt. With master raids coming down the pipeline these would be some good incentives, alongside the adept rewards, to do them a lot."

1,If you're grinding Gambit for a god roll Bottom Dollar..,"In my quest to get a God roll Bottom Dollar, I have some information to share.

I did not keep track of everything I got because I never thought I would take it this far, but curfew in my part of the world gave me plenty of time to waste.

My seasonal Gambit infamy score is 200,000. Motes banked, 20,000.

My first Bottom Dollar was a decently rolled Quickdraw/HIR. I got it after about 15-20 matches. I should've quit then, but here we are.

At around 90,000 Infamy rank, I got a very very good Surplus/Explosive payload. But it just didn't fit my play style since I used abilities, the inconsistencies bothered me on a hand cannon. (I love it on my Frozen Orbit)

At approx 120,000 I got an Outlaw/Multikill Clip, which is awesome for 6s, but I'm more of a 3s type of guy. Still awesome to have in the vault.

At approx 190,000 I got a God Rolled Rangerfinder/Opening shot. It has a good barrel, steadyrounds and a handling masterwork. It's awesome.

That said, I still didn't get MY god roll of quickdraw/explosive payload.

Along the way I've gotten a few other decent rolls, I would say about 5 of them were good. But only 3 were very good. I would estimate all my BD drops to amount to about 25-30.

Another thing I noticed is I only got 1 with Opening Shot and probably 5-6 with Hipfire (FACEPALM).

Link to an old useful thread by u/Dud3_perfect
[Getting a good rolled bottom dollar](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lj2vhp/here_are_the_odds_of_getting_a_good_rolled_bottom/)

There is a good reason that in one of the first BL cutscenes the only person we see using stasis is The Stranger.  They also didn't just include 3 People using darkness for no reason.  Its because The Stranger, Eris Morn, and The Drifter all represent a part of the darkness. 

Stranger- Stasis
Eris- Soulfire

1,Warlock fashion is severely limited by the chest piece. Gauntlets need to change to stand out more.,"In Destiny 1, like the other two classes, Warlocks arm piece included shoulder pads. In the release of Destiny 2 Warlocks had this feature removed, their chest piece now dictates the shoulder area (unlike the other classes which still follow the Destiny 1 system). I could go on for how bad of a change this is but that’s been beaten to the ground, and frankly, it’s far too late to change it anyways.

What I suggest is this. Make warlock gauntlets more interesting. Take a look at Ophidian Aspect. Beautiful gauntlets with cool detail. Sunbracers are another example, bringing the design of the gauntlet all the way to the knuckles. Why do only exotic gauntlets get to stand out? 9/10 Warlock gauntlets look the same, they feel heavily limited in terms of design. One of my favourite Warlock gauntlets is the Liminal Voyager Gloves just because of how unique it is. 

With the new gauntlet ornament from the season of the chosen pass, we can see the gauntlets actually add rings to each finger of which are attached to the gauntlets by string which also wraps around the palm of the hands. Now I’m not saying these gauntlets look good, but it shows that legendary gauntlets can break the mould of just one single plate slapped on the forearm (Celestial Gloves, Wrath Trail Gloves, Intrepid Gloves, Moonfang, Iron Truage, etc., etc., etc.), wraps (These being bandages wrapped around the forearm), or back hand plates (like the single plates but with an additional piece on the back of the hand). 

Channeling CODA, and before it the Trials of the Nine gauntlets, are the back handed plates type but add a spine coming out. Steeplechase are just single plate arms but have a Thrall jaw sticking out of the elbow. More of these gauntlets that build on the subtypes rather than just changing the pattern are needed. Add more parts, make them flashy and stand out. Make them effect the hand. With Warlock fashion being tied so heavily to the Robes, please expand on the gauntlets."

1,Prosperity mods should GUARANTEE you a playlist drop (with some bad math),"Currently from strikes you can get:


&gt;Royal Entry 9x10

&gt;Xenoclast 12x12

&gt;The Third Axiom 12x12

That’s 378 possible random rolls, not counting the first two columns. 

Crucible is even worse:

&gt;The Keening 12x12

&gt;Stars in Shadow 12x12

&gt;Frozen Orbit 12x12 

432 possible random rolls. 

Gambit is possibly better, but we’ll get to that: 

&gt;Bottom Dollar 12x12

&gt;Trinary System 12x12

&gt;Crowd Pleaser 10x10

388 possible random rolls (seems better right?)

&gt;Weapon roll RNG

So let's look at the RNG layers you need to get through for a weapon of choice, like the Grave Robber + One Two punch Xenoclast I’ve been grinding for since Beyond Light dropped. On the first column I don’t care, Barrel Shroud would be nice for bonus handling but it’s not required. Second column, I’d like Assault Mag but it’s not required either. What I’m strictly after is the Grave Robber + One Two Punch combo, so I’m looking at a 1/144 chance for that exact roll. On average 1 in 144 drops I get will be that roll, but it isn’t promised. It could be 20 or it could be 200.

Let's get a little more wild with the wanted roll through: Trinary System with Arrowhead Brake, Particle Repeater, Autoloading Holster, Tap the Trigger, and a stability masterwork. That’s (2/9)*(2/6)*(1/12)*(1/12)*(1/5). That's 1 in 9720 (I’ll admit this might be fuzzy because I don’t exactly remember how to do subsets of a whole mathematically but it’s a useful illustrative tool nonetheless). Now this is an absolute dream, and I’d be a little more flexible with it (namely Battery and Masterwork options), but we’re still talking into the hundreds for a drop chance. 

&gt;Drop rate RNG

Now, I can’t remember exactly how many strikes I’d completed before the emblem counter reset but I know it’s well over 1100 total now. I like them a lot, especially after I learned how to turn off Matchmaking. Solo strikes are the perfect balance between difficulty and commitment to unwind after work. This season I’ve completed 81 strikes. I’ve gotten some decent drops but I’ve completely given up on grinding the playlist for the drops, which is a shame because it’s genuinely enjoyable content. It’s just not a viable way to spend my time working toward a reward I want though. As much as I want the weapons, I’m looking at spending ~15 minutes between completions and not getting playlist drops for 5-6 strikes in a row.

What's worse than that? Gambit. I refuse to believe that the Gambit playlist drops aren’t bugged or have an extra 0 put in front of their drop chance, because there’s absolutely no way the weapons are dropping as intended. I played 25 games of Gambit last weekend and got 1 Crowd Pleaser. 1. A singular playlist drop for 3 ½ hours of playing a playlist (started at 2330, finished at 0330). That’s not depressing, it’s downright insulting. 

Bottom Dollar and Trinary System? Still undiscovered in my collections.

&gt;A solution

That is a lot of pretext for this point: A ritual playlist weapon drop should be guaranteed with a prosperity mod on your ghost. I don’t think having large perk variety in both columns is a bad thing, and there’s a lot of combinations that I’m excited for. Low drop rate on exceedingly random weapons means that drops I want are practically unattainable, and the drops I get only go to showcase just how stilted the odds are against me.

I reiterate that I’ve done 81 strikes this season (I'd wager 95%+ were completed with the Prosperity Vanguard on my ghost), if I had gotten 81 weapon drops I probably would have a decent amount of passable stuff but all I’ve gotten that’s worth keeping this season is a Third Axiom with Zen Moment / Dragonfly (workable but not great), and a Royal Entry with Impact Casing / Field Prep / Cluster (also workable but seriously outclassed). I've probably spent 20 hours in strikes just this season and that's what I have to show for it.

You know what an even better option would be? A togglable item in your quests inventory or on your seasonal artifact that lets you choose what weapon you want from each playlist. I would happily grind Gambit if I got a Trinary System from each game, and I’m sure many many members of the community would do the same for their perfect Bottom Dollar. 

Would it probably need to be bumped up in cost? Probably, because I know now after typing all this up I'm currently spending 3 points for what feels like nothing.

I'm sorry this is so long, it was a slow night at work and I'm not allowed to sleep."
1,I think Banshee can be used to address the returning elephant in the room with sunsetting removed.,"So we've all seen post that Banshee is underutilised with how he's meant to be a gunsmith yet he's just like any other vendor, and yes this is another one of those.

Now that Sunsetting has been sunset the 'elephant in the room' I'm talking about that needs to be addressed is that the loot pool will once more quickly expand so that it becomes stupidly hard to get a specific roll on a specific weapon, but i think the solution to this would be utilising Banshee.

Basically, like before with Sunsetting older seasonal loot should be removed from the world loot pool, and then every day Banshee will offer three random weapons, Kinetic, Energy and a Heavy with as set roll but these weapons have a pool that consists of weapons that **have been removed from the games loot pool and are currently unattainable**, it will give newer players and older players that got screwed over by RNG a chance to get  older weapons with good rolls whilst also making sure the world or activity loot pool isn't too overcrowded.

The reason i said to provide one of each slot daily is mostly just because three seems like a good amount and one of each slot will make it so the RNG can't weigh heavily towards a single slot constantly like it probably would.

For what the weapons cost, probably just Gunsmith materials (Maybe also Telemetry to give it use)

Well that's all i got, just popped in my head."
1,Destiny 2 Maintenance Megathread [2021-03-16],"Hey Guardians, 

Here's a megathread for the upcoming maintenance that will bring us Update 3.1.1. All posts about the maintenance will be redirected to this thread.

###Game will be brought offline when this thread is ONE HOUR old. Maintenance begins when this thread is 15 MINUTES old. Some features of third party apps (like DIM) could be disabled then, before the game is offline.

###Game Downtime is 15 MINUTES (until WEEKLY RESET).

###Patch &amp; Patchnotes should hit at WEEKLY RESET as well.

Please note that maintenance isn't fully over until one hour after reset, which means third party apps (like DIM, and your beloved /u/DTG_Bot) might not completely work until then!

1,Destiny 1 servers down?,"I tried to log into D1 about an hour ago, but I kept getting Error Code ""Stingray"" when trying to log in

The error code says:

""This error appears to players who are not signed in with their platform account, or their platform services are undergoing maintenance. Additionally, this error may appear to players on console whose PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live subscription has expired.""

Here's the problem;
- I'm signed into my account
- Xbox servers are fine
- And I just recently renewed my Xbox Live subscription

So this error code makes no sense

And I'm not alone in this. At least 1 other person on Destiny Amino is having trouble logging into D1, which brought my attention to this issue

I know that D2 servers are going down in a little bit, but the Bungie Help account on Twitter never said anything about D1 servers. Is this simply a weird bug, or truly the end of an era?"

1,"Bungie, over the past few years you've done great work to recover Destiny 2 and shift it towards a legendary game. But one thing is still missing that is holding it back from coming into its own.","Where the hell is the Iris Pulsator shell? 

Back when Warmind dropped, and the datamine came out, most eyes were on leaked Whisper perks and the like--but for us fashion-oriented guardians, there was a bigger prize. The Iris Pulsator shell. There were 2 Eververse, 1 Crucible, and 1 Trials exotic shell, which all made sense, but there was a 5th one that wasn't linked to any activity. And it looked [*sick*](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3775812469/iris-pulsator-shell/). At first, people assumed it was for the Raid Lair; nope. Maybe a hidden puzzle? No. Maybe it's just really rare and from EP? Not at all. Perhaps it's from Solstice, or from that upcoming mission we expect? Neither of those were true. One of the new Nightfalls? We got a transmat instead.

So a season went by, with no news on an insanely cool ghost shell. Rumors that it was an early drop in for FOTL were passed around, and peoples' hopes began to rise once more. When it dropped, however, every single D2 player was remiss to find out it wasn't part of that release either; rather, the similar, yet vastly inferior 
Okular Fortitude Shell came out, which was objectively less good. 

As disappointments mounted, the number of people who held out hope continued to dwindle, and today, they are fewer of us left than prime servitors. The only thing unfettered is our hope. 

So Bungie, please, give us a bone. A sign. Say it doesn't work. Say it's a big prank. Say we found the wrong thing in the woods of upstate New York; we were supposed to find a code to unlock the shell, but someone left the life-sized Rasputin Javelin there by mistake. Just give us a sign. We need it."

1,Elimination is the reason Trials is a Snooze Fest,"Lots of blame thrown at stasis and chaos reach for slowing down gameplay and turning Trials into an ability and super simulator.  Power fantasy.  It's talked about ad nauseum (for good reason) on all Destiny subreddits, however is often limited to the PvE world.  To steal the words of u/Jaerthebearr, we are God-Slaying, Atomic Starfire Hurling, Immortal Guardians.  The Crucible can make you feel this way, but RARELY from Trials/Elimination.  Playing the Counter-Strike franchise throughout my life I get it, it can be very satisfying clutching those 1v3's to get the round win.  But in Destiny, something about a no respawn mode just feels off.  The pinnacle endgame PvP activity should reward guardians for doing what they do best, slaying everything in front of them.  Game modes that encourage constant conflict (Hardpoint,Oddball.....) would drastically speed up Trials for the good and encourage the use of more subclasses."
1,Add a Two Burst Scout or Auto Rifle,"It’s been fairly obvious that many many ideas for guns have been done already but a two burst weapon would be amazing, it would be something new to have and use I feel like it would be good against Hand cannons because landing 2 rapid hits on them the flinch would make them have a smaller chance of winning that battle and that would help even the meta, Also it would be perfect for pve 2 high damage rapid shots against something like a shank or Dreg would be amazing."
1,"With today's reset, we are reaching the halfway point of this season, expect content to slow down","That's why seasonal challenges will be grindier in the later weeks. We are reaching the point of the season where content slows down. (Not like there was much here besides one mission, and one activity that imo, could use a better loot targeting system, Chalice of Opulence WHEN?)

If you feel like you need a short term break, this is the time to do it. Guardian Games (which &gt;!appears to take in elements from the Revelry and *seems* to revolve more around strikes this year!&lt;) will be when you may want to check in to see what's going on.


Otherwise, besides Proving Grounds, don't expect massive sweeping amounts of content. Story developments may happen but you don't need to be playing and grinding to see those.


Personal take on the season: I like how Battlegrounds are, a lot of enemies, but personally, I really think there should be some more meaningful content next season. Something difficult, grindable, and has a good targeting system (Chalice of Opulence?) We're gonna have the raid, which is cool, i'm more thinking about the other seasonal activity that isn't the raid."
1,The normal melee animation for Stasis hunter should've been a stasis dagger,"The hunter stasis subclass menu literally shows off your hunter wielding a stasis dagger, but not once do we actually use such a thing. It doesn't have to slow or freeze, I just want to stab people with a dagger made of stasis as the default melee animation, and Bungie denied us that after teasing us with it in the subclass menu and gave us a regular punch instead. Pfft, if I wanted to punch people, I'd be playing an arc subclass or a titan. The titans get shown using their fist covered in stasis in their subclass menu and they get to use it. Warlocks get shown playing with a stasis projectile in their subclass menu that they also get to use. The subclass is also called Revenant, which is essentially a type of ghost. When have you ever heard of a ghost story where the ghost punches people in the woods or an abandoned house?

Come on, you're nerfing hunter stasis anyway. Throw us a bone and change the normal melee animation into a stasis dagger instead of a punch."
1,Missing Champion in Concealed Void Legendary 1300 Lost Sector," I have done the concealed void lost sector today solo 12 times each time I kill every champion, I then watched Esoterickks vid on this lost sector solo and noticed I was missing the second captain champion.

1,An idea that I had,"Probably has been said before but it would be interesting to get raids and quests to destinations other than the ones on our main director.

I think it would be kinda similar to the dead mans tale quest where we are taken to a destination that’s relatively new but isnt to the level of a “planetary” destination 

Lets use the Manhattan nuclear zone for example 


Its not a destination in game but it would be interesting if we got a “hidden” quest there, pretty similar to the dead mans tale quest so i suppose its not a new idea at all 

Idk i just think it would be cool to be able to check out new places other than the locations we have now without having to add a whole new plannet or large map

What do you think?"

1,How I can get better with chaperone?,"I usually play pvp as a sniper/long range engagement, last season I started playing with the GL and hand cannon combo (using the fast swap mod) so I started playing more aggressive.

Now I want to start playing with slug shotgun (mainly chaperone), just because sometimes I see someone destroying entire lobbies with that.

Do you have any fun build to pair with it or any general tips?

Just to give you some context: I play D2 since release but actually started playing pvp better in S10, but never really used shotguns (I got like 500 SG kills out of 70.000 kills total)."
1,The Handcannon Farm Week,"Hello People Of All Ages and Sizes,

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you had a great week especially if you (like me) were farming Hand Cannons all week long since reset.

First sorry to all Trials players either you got a great roll, bad roll or no roll...mostly no roll for most. RIP   
Gambit had a ton bonus Infany so hope you guys played a ton. I did about 95 games, reset my infamy twice and got 6 bottom dollars ;5 of which were garbage and one was ok so I kept it. It about 6% percent chance for me so hope you guys had better luck.

But the real meat of this is the Palindrome farm, and Bungie, if you are listening (hope you are) seriously check for perk lockouts or something cause I did 150 NF runs this week. 149 on Master and 1 Legend and still till now in about 60+ Palindromes I have not gotten one Quickdraw Rangefinder. I mean damn. Quickdraw I have sen drop about 5 times and ranger finder even less so what gives? I mean I made friends and met a ton of people which you want us to do but Holy \*\*\*\* 150 runs and not even a bad Quickdraw Rangefinder?

Check the drop chances please and adjust it for those who really put time into this. peeps sound off in the comments how your farming went and hope you made some new friends like me :) The farm goes on untill the reset. Thanks"
1,Destiny Armor Materials,"I recently purchased Destiny: The Collection, which included a Level 40 boost, as well as some Light 250 gear. However, after equipping those weapons and reaching level 40, the only thing that drops from activity completions is armor materials. Is this normal?"
1,Please reverse the Chaos Reach super regeneration nerf for the PvE sandbox,"I’m no PvP player, but I heard that the Chaos Reach could be spammed relatively faster than other supers. Even though you can’t run across the map with Chaos Reach and eliminate an entire team, it was nerfed because you could use it more often than other supers. Fair enough.

But why one earth was it also nerfed in PvE?

Differences between the PvE and PvP sandboxes are being made more and more, yet you decide to punish PvE players because something can be a nuisance in PvP.

Come on Bungie, please reverse the nerf of Chaos Reach in the PvE sandbox."

1,Do Destiny 1 Raids Still Exist?,"Sorry if this has been asked before, I tried google but couldn’t find anything on the subject, which is probably a good sign. 

But I know some of Destiny 2’s raids are no longer available to play, is that true of Destiny 1?

I’m deciding which I’m going to purchase (Destiny 1 Collection vs. Destiny 2 Legendary), and this is a huge determining factor for me."
1,Bungie trying to balance PvE AND PvP solely around the PvP crowd is really killing PvE. Rip Bakris next.,"Full disclosure I play all 3 classes pretty equally and I just started to get back into the game recently. 

Saying that, just last night I managed to drop the hunter helm exotic Bakris that changes the dodge into a mini teleport and works well with Stasis. 

My first response to that? Excitement because as I'm sure a lot of Hunter players know, most of the armour exotics are god awfully boring (oh you get two knives? Grenades do an extra skip? Wow mindblowing) and barely change the gameplay whatsoever. 

So getting to use an exotic that actually literally changed up your gameplay in a small way was super exciting. 

Now I hop on Reddit and what's the first thing I see? A big complaint thread about said same exotic about how OP it is in PvP. Don't get me wrong yes it and stasis and 500 other things and just PvP in fucking general needs some massive balancing.

But please leave it alone in PvE. There is NOTHING wrong with things being a bit more overpowered or gameplay impacting in PvE. Honestly Destiny needs more OP stuff you can form full builds around because the game is seriously lacking in the impactful build decisions. Because whether it's exotics, weapons or supers everything seems to get nerfed into the ground because of PvP when it isn't an issue in PvE. 

I love PvP at times (even though it's a hand cannon shotgun fest) but PvE is where most of Destiny's content is and is what most players engage with so for the love of god can Bungie just start flat out balancing them separately? We're supposed to be magical ass sci-fi space warriors with super powers not characters that throw a knife or smack someone in the face once a minute or use a 10 second ultimate ability on a 5 minute cooldown that should probably just tickle because everything's OP in PvP. 

I don't want to even bother investing in Bakris because I just know it will be nerfed into the void because it's good in PvP. Like poor Chaos Reach and basically the whole damn game at this point. 

TLDR: Please stop nerfing stuff just because it's ""OP"" in a completely separate part of the game with it's own ecosystem. PvE and PvP are polar opposites and for the most part also have polar opposite playerbases. Stop nuking the ""power fantasy"" aspect of Destiny."

Easiest solution would be just to add +15 or +20 range to the catalyst along with the original bonus of two remnants per kill."
1,A new Niobe Labs style combat experience (without the bugs) would be neat to have,"New Lights, if you haven't heard of it, during the Black Armory days, there was this combat experience called Niobe Labs (thrown into the DCV, or if we're not using Bungie's terms, removed from the game) which had you fighting actually difficult Fallen, while solving 7 puzzles. Those puzzles could only be solved using some of the Black Armory weapons (before you freak out, they were VERY targeted, so they were trivial to get exactly what you wanted/needed for the puzzle) and the puzzles were pretty complex and difficult. Completing it got you an emblem and ghost shell.

I know Niobe Labs wasn't exactly perfect, but it was a really cool concept and combat experience, minus the bugs that plagued the Level 7 puzzle, and I really think having one of those experiences in the game again would be really good. It would allow this community to rally together and get to puzzle solving, something I feel we've been missing from Destiny since Season of Dawn. (No, I don't count the Beyond Light ARG, that wasn't an in game thing) 

I just think it's worth a shot bringing a new Niobe Labs style activity."

1,"Bungie, if you don't have the time or workforce to improve Gambit, please put it into the DCV.","I think I speak for almost the whole community when I say that playing this mode is genuinely horrible almost all the time.

I could list dozens of problems with this gamemode that haven't been addressed for years. Xenophage. The rampant heavy ammo. The overpowered invading. The melting of primevals. The matchmaking against four-stacks.

Bungie, we have been asking you to improve this gamemode for ages. It has so much potential, yet nothing has been done to fix it's huge flaws. If you won't fix Gambit, there's no point in it being in the game. I'm sick of being required by bounties and challenges to play a gamemode that makes me feel helpless, frustrated and bullied as a player.

Sad as I am to say it, removing Gambit and the requirement to play it every week would make far more people happier than keeping it in the game."

I'm very confused. I don't understand what the new model is between buying expansions, but still needing to buy season passes? Also, I can access some new content but not all? How would I even just play the original campaign, or, if I do buy the new expansions, just play those campaigns before hopping into PVP or group events?

It'd be a huge help if someone could explain the new model and how to navigate the Director a bit. Also, if there are recommendations on any bundles to purchase instead of individual purchases, that'd be great.

1,Why Lobby Balancing is Often Set Up to Fail,"If you’ve been around Destiny 2 social media in the past couple of seasons, you’ve probably seen some complaints (if not several dozen) about matchmaking and lobby balancing in PVP activities. Whether it’s Control, Iron Banner, or Gambit, there seem to be quite a bit of mercies. I’ve been on both sides of them myself, and it’s really not fun either way. I don’t like getting stomped, and I feel bad as well when I’m on the winning side of an 86-15 blowout.

Some Guardians have blamed the lobby balancing, while others have blamed the CBMM. I’m here to tell you that both of those parties are partially correct. While there may be some small adjustments that can be made to the lobby balancing algorithm, too often the games are already set up to be blowouts before the first bullet is fired. In this post I’m going to look into why. (I’m going to avoid the general SBMM vs CBMM debates and instead talk about the flaws in the current CBMM and how we can make it better).

Let’s start off with defining the ideal matchmaking system as one that does the following:

* Gives the fastest queue times possible
* Keeps players close to each other ping-wise
* Gives each team as equal a chance to win as possible
* Achieves the first three while still allowing for a diverse skillset within teams

Since the [Season of Arrivals](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49254), all game modes except for Trials of Osiris, Elimination, and Survival use Connection-Based Matchmaking (CBMM). The way CBMM works is the matchmaking system searches for players near each other, regardless of their skill level, and puts them into a lobby together. At no point is skill thought about while putting players into a game; it just tries to put twelve players into a lobby together as quickly as possible based off their close connection to each other. The repeated claim I’ve seen here on Reddit and on the Bungie forums is that “it’s the lobby balancing” that is causing so many mercies in PVP. However, there are some lobbies that just can’t be balanced, because CBMM and bad RNG set it up to fail.

**Scenario #1: The Fireteam**

Let’s remember that CBMM doesn’t take into account skill when filling a lobby, but just fills it as fast as it can with players who have close connection to each other. Sometimes, the game is over before it starts because of who is in the lobby. Try to balance the following players on a made-up ELO skill of 1-10, 10 being high.

&gt;Fireteam: 8 8 7 7  
&gt;  
&gt;Fireteam: 4 3  
&gt;  
&gt;Solo Players: 5 5 4 3 3 3

The problem here is that 4-person fireteam with high ELO players; you can’t break up that team, so one team is going to be more skilled than the other. The best case scenario is combined ELOs of 36 vs 24 (8 8 7 7 3 3 vs 5 5 4 4 3 3). You just can't balance this lobby. 

If you don’t like that made up scenario, then here’s a real one. [This is from an Iron Banner game](https://imgur.com/a/85EvDyc) a few weeks ago (player names have been hidden). You can see that the average ELOs of the fireteams are 1611 vs 1082. Alpha team (which was a full 6-stack) had a 95% chance of winning, and they did win 80-25. Three of the players on that team had higher ELO than the best player on Bravo team. This isn’t even that extreme an example; I’ve seen fireteams where 5 or 6 of them all have Diamond ELO and they obliterate the other team. This game was over before it began, and lobby-balancing couldn’t do a thing about it because you can’t split up that fireteam.

“Well,” you might think “maybe if we made a Freelance mode, then this sort of thing wouldn’t happen.” Unfortunately, Freelance lobbies are prone to the same problem.

**Scenario #2: The Unequal Skill Distribution**

Freelance can have the same problem of an uneven, un-balanceable skill distribution even before the lobby is formed. Let's use that same 1-10 scale in a Freelance lobby (all solo players). Here are the first eight players pulled into a match in this scenario:

9, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2

Let’s pause here. At this point, you would really like an 8, 9, or 10 in the lobby to put against the 9, but you might not get that with CBMM; CBMM isn’t looking to make balanced lobbies, it only looks to quickly make lobbies and then attempt to balance them afterwards. Let's say the next players you get are 2, 3, 4, and 3. The lobby balancing algorithm makes the teams 9 2 2 3 4 4 vs 5 5 5 4 3 3. This might seem somewhat balanced (the 9’s team has a 24 combined ELO while the other team is 25) but what frequently happens in this scenario (according to the experiences of this subreddit) is the 9 may have a really good performance but he or she will probably lose because the rest of their team is not as skilled as the team they are facing. 50% of the first team is worse than 66% of the second team. The 9 will likely complain that their team can’t do anything while the 2’s will complain that everyone is better than them. I’ve seen complaints that this scenario happens in Freelance Survival, where the outlier players get put on the same team and none of them enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

The lesson that this community needs to learn from these examples is that **lobby/team balancing only works if you have a somewhat equal distribution of skill levels within the lobby, and any fireteams aren't preventing the lobby from being balanced.** So the question is, how do we fix this going forward?

# We need a hybrid matchmaking system. We need a matchmaking system that is thinking about lobby balancing as the lobby is formed and gives a slight filter as to who gets pulled in so that the teams have the opportunity to be balanced.

This is easier in Freelance activities like Iron Banner. After the first 6, 7, or 8 players join a lobby, the game analyzes its current player pool, looks for outliers, and begins a slightly more narrow approach to finding players so that the lobby has the opportunity to be balanced, instead of doing the best it can with an unequal distribution of skills.

&amp;#x200B;

If we’re talking about dealing with fireteams, that's a bit more complicated. Let’s remember that our goals are to give quick, balanced games, while also not pigeonholing high-skill players into “Diamond ELO only” lobbies. My opinion is that a good CBMM lobby will allow for a diverse set of skills in a game while also keeping the teams fair. I’ve read comments on Reddit advocating for “6-stacks should only play 6-stacks” but I think that’s too simple and also too strong of an approach. Sometimes you get fireteams that already have a diverse skillset.

Personally, I would like to see a matchmaking system where any fireteam of 4 or more Guardians with a high average-ELO would be put into a lobby that would give outlier protection, and only players above a certain ELO would be put into that lobby. It's not purely SBMM, but it should avoid the scenario where a fireteam of 5 Diamond ELO players ends up going against mostly Bronze and Silver ELO players (which yeah, been there, done that, and it wasn't fun).

I know some high-skill players really aren't going to like this, but I think there is a certain point where **the magnitude of skill difference in a lobby makes the game devolve into a disaster of a game that should never have been played.** One time I played against a 6-stack in Iron Banner and the final score was 90-6; it was a waste of my and everyone else’s time. I’ve been on the other side of those games too, and I feel bad for the other team when that happens.

Some players freak out whenever you mention the words skill and matchmaking in the same sentence. I’m not advocating for going back to pure SBMM, I want something in between that and CBMM. There’s a difference between a matchmaking system that allows for skill diversity but keeps teams fair and the current matchmaking system that just throws teams together without a care for the result. A good matchmaking system can allow for high-skill players to be put against average or low-skill players (thought I would like to see some sort of outlier protection for new and very bad players) while keeping the teams balanced, but it shouldn’t allow for KD farmers to stomp the opposition into oblivion every game.

TL,DR: We need a hybrid matchmaking system that allows for lobby balancing to actually happen, by thinking about lobby balancing as the teams are formed and using some skill filters on the back portion of the lobby."

I got my discipline to 103, and i just keeps on throwing shields. Its insane my ult can last for mins.  


PS: Not sure if this is a bug, but throwing the shield with doom fang while the boss is immune generates more energy for your super, so.. if boss is immune technically you just have to keep on spamming your shield.

1,"Very nice New Zealander, being a real Guardian","So I got into D2 last year, as I have had lots of free time, and my pal was playing alone. I've been loving it, and I managed to clear all the now sunsetted content before Beyond Light came out, so the only Raid I had yet to finish was Last Wish.

I hopped into an LFG last week at Riven, and was amazed to find that the Fireteam Leader was asking to do the encounter legit.

As we wiped our way through Queen's Walk, they explained they were trying to learn every encounter legit, so they could Sherpa Fireteams. Specifically wanting to work with fellow guardians who live with Learning Difficulties and Social Anxiety.

1,Please reverse the Chaos Reach super regeneration nerf for the PvE sandbox,"I’m no PvP player, but I heard that the Chaos Reach could be spammed relatively faster than other supers. Even though you can’t run across the map with Chaos Reach and eliminate an entire team, it was nerfed because you could use it more often than other supers. Fair enough.

But why one earth was it also nerfed in PvE?

Differences between the PvE and PvP sandboxes are being made more and more, yet you decide to punish PvE players because something can be a nuisance in PvP.

Come on Bungie, please reverse the nerf of Chaos Reach in the PvE sandbox."
1,Are anyone elses Trials items lighting up?,"My Trials Helmet is lighting up again for some reason, and I haven't touched Trials since I got it Months ago in my only ever Flawless Run. At first I was afraid someone was using my account but I don't have anything new unlocked and am still the same level as I was the other day. As well as Trials being cancelled this weekend anyway. Is this happening for anyone else? That would be awesome if Bungie changed it so whatever piece you get as the Flawless stayed lit up, alongside the Adept Perks and stuff?"
1,Exotic catalysts that are unobtainable,[removed]
1,Bungie shouldn't ignore sunsetting as a future balancing tool,"*TLDR; sunsetting COULD be a good tool for sandbox balancing, IF it was selectively implemented with weapons meant to top the sandbox (I.E. Recluse, mountaintop, felwinters)*

with the likes of felwinters lie and future weapons that are MADE to be powerful and to take the sandbox by storm, could still be sunset

imagine next season a ritual weapon that completely breaks one sandbox or another, don't nerf them into there place instead they should come with a 2 or 3 season power cap,

this was the original proposal of sunsetting, powerful or broken pinnacles would be given there day in the sun and then, when that sun sets, they go with it.

i dont believe this should be retroactive, such as a general buff breaking a specific weapon shouldn't then lead to that weapon being knee caped,

BUT with the likes of the felwinters; it could drop with a sunset date, as it was meant to be powerful,

this could also be used as a testing tool, imagine if bungie dropped say a box breathing bow. this weapon COULD break the game who knows, but by introducing them with an hard end date they wouldn't be as big an issue. 

i also think 4 seasons is to long in this set up, with these weapons potentially rising high and long constantly scorching those that would go without"

1,"Bungie, can Anti-barrier rounds shoot through Lurker shields already?","Kind of annoying that my anti-barrier rounds can fire through the war-machine tech of a Cabal Phalanx, the time bending shields of a Hydra, the sun energy shields of a Hobgoblin, the bone death-magic shields of a Hive Knight, the literal Dark energy god power shields of a Taken Phalanx, and yet can't shoot through the trashcan lid held by the Scorns version of a zombie child cosplaying as Captain America."
1,Gambit is currently the worst and most wildly inconsistent mode in the game,"TL;DR- Gambit is a terrible, frustrating experience due to bugs, RNG, weird balancing, and melt mechanics. 

I have saved screen grabs of being at full health and getting two shot by a single AI enemy. 

I have screen grabs of motes sitting on the ground and just disappearing. And not ""I've been sitting here too long"" disappearing. I mean, I just killed the enemy, motes are on the ground a few seconds and then they're just... gone. For some reason, when the enemy team summoned their primeval, it deleted all the motes that were on the ground in our arena. 

I have a screenshot of EIGHT MOTES that have fallen through the map in the same area from killing an HVT. Not exactly worth hunting it down if half the motes it drops can't be picked up. 

When you play a strike, you feel reasonably confident in close quarters against red bars. Your primaries feel like they work pretty well, even against yellow bars.  Suddenly in gambit, primaries feel like trash and everything is tanky as hell. Its a jarring experience to go from patrol/strikes to Gambit. You suddenly go from being a god, to being a paper skinned bullet magnet, despite no real indication that you should be more cautious. The enemies feel like they belong in endgame content, not a non-level locked core playlist. And like those endgame level activities, the enemies glitch-teleport EVERYWHERE. 

Heavy ammo drops are inconsistent as hell. You can go several games without seeing a single brick despite having double ammo finder mods equipped. And then the next game, you have 12 bricks drop and can't possibly use all the ammo thats dropped. Meanwhile an invader can shoot 3 Eyes of Tomorrow rockets on an invasion, leave, then immediately invade AGAIN and pop off three more shots. RNG Heavy should not be a thing in any activity that involves PvP. 

What is even the point of multiple envoy spawns when you can melt the boss with Falling Star Titans and Chaos Reach Warlocks after killing just two? And why are the first two so tanky, yet the next two pairs can basically be sneezed on and die instantly? All this does is prevent the team thats behind from catching up in any meaningful way. 

Having an enemy team invade and wipe out your team on the first invasion of the match is devastating. Having them do it once and knock you back to zero, then invade again with the enemy having 75 in the bank before you've hit 20 is worse. Having them invade a THIRD TIME when their boss is at half health and you haven't even hit 50 motes banked? Just sit and wait for the match to end. That first invasion more often than not determines how the match will end. Its not exactly encouraging within two minutes of the match starting to realize you have little if any hope of catching up. 

Bungie tried to mix both modes together to be lazy and not need to maintain two separate modes anymore, and in the process they basically took Trials or Comp and put those players in with Quickplay guardians. The mote drain mechanic more often than not only serves to kick a losing team, or a team of solo players, while they're down. Removing the damage gating mechanic that was in Gambit Prime and allowing teams to boss melt right off the bat made matches shorter, which seems nice, but it also allows teams to absolutely murder the primeval far faster. 

Even having an invader who manages 3-4 kills every time during the enemies primeval phase doesn't really help now, because if the opposing team gets to Primeval Slayer 4, they can melt the boss in between one invasion and the next. I played a match where that exact thing happened, our invader was amazing, but because he didn't invade first, his first invasion only happened when the enemy team was at 80 motes banked. They had prevented our invasions by wiping us the first invasion and then draining us after that. He proceeded to invade every time after they summoned their primeval and managed to heal it back to full health or close to it every time, until we summoned our own. But by then the opposing team had pushed it past the halfway point and with slayer 4 versus our team of solo players not even at 2 yet, they melted their boss before he could go in again. 

The mode is a wreck. It doesn't feel good to play. Id equate it very much to being in the crucible right now- its frustrating, you run into sweats far above your skill level super often, you get completely dunked on often when you are playing solo, and it feels like you get the Gambit equivalent of Mercy 4/5 of the time. 

If they want to save the mode, they HAVE to do some tuning. It isn't Trials, its not Legend Comp, its not a GM nightfall. It shouldn't feel this bad to play. 

I recognize that there will always be a meta, no matter what weapons or abilities are adjusted. There will always be a ""quickest strategy"" to summon and kill the primeval. My beef with the mode comes from the experience being super inconsistent. One game, you are getting heavy drops, motes aren't disappearing or falling through, enemies don't seem to kill you so quickly, the teams feel balanced and you get a heart-pumping race to the finish. The next, you get killed 3 times by an invader while the bank always seems to be locked with 3 large blockers, the AI enemies somehow keep killing you even though your aren't playing any different than before, you dont see any heavy at all, and the enemy team kills their primeval within 15 seconds of summoning it while you dont even have 20 motes banked. And even then, the 3rd game YOU manage to be the team that dunks on the opponent. Having those massive swings makes it feel like, as a solo player, you can't plan or strategize much at all."
1,Edited : Exotic update/revisit for titan class ability exotics,"*EDIT ; this is an older post of mine, the purpose of reuploading it is to introduce multiple edits, this was originally posted 6 months ago before Beyond light was dropped, yeah its been that long*

since travellers chosen has made the use of exotics made for class ability's more viable i thought i should post some of my brain farts in regards to QoL etc for them

DISCLAIMER : I MAIN TITAN HENCE THE ONLY TITAN EXOTICS BEING IN HERE, if someone would like to comment, for the other classes, (strengths weaknesses etc) i would love to make a follow up for Warlocks and hunters

also comment or message me your thoughts feelings opinions ETC, on this topic (see below for an important note)

**EXOTIC 1, KHEPRI'S HORN**

* this is a fun exotic the solar blast barricade, is cool and can be VERY effective if the star aline i have gotten 3 kills in 1 blast with it
* weaknesses
   * solar blast is only launched after the barricade is dropped
      * the summon time is killer,
      * this means you need to use it more like a AOE short lock down
   * the damage of the barricade is split in half with the blast initially launching forwards and then pulling back
      * this damage split is annoying considering that if a blast hits a wall before turning around you lose that damage potential
      * the damage blast also does weird slopping with it's damage
* My idea

1. decrease the size, HP and the duration of the barricade
   1. make the barricade more like a single person barricade
   2. (similar to the HALO 3 armour ability pickup deploy-able cover. or halo 4's hard light shield
2. MASSIVE Decrease to the summon speed of the barricade (about a 3x - 4x decrease)
   1. this would cover the summoning/timing weaknesses i state
3. change the solar blast's mechanics (2 ideas see Bold Idea 2)
   1. remove the returning blast, and replace it with a secondary blast released from the barricade
   2. damage (pvp) scales from 250dmg, at 0m-5m, 200dmg from 10m-15m, 100dmg 15m-20m 0dmg &gt;20m
   3. damage(PvE), does full damage at 20m this is because damage fall off on this cant be bad
4. **IDEA 2**
   1. remove the returning blast and replace it with THREE out going blasts with 1 going centre, and the other 2 coming off an 35 degree angle from the centre of the shield
   2. damage (pvp) scales from 250dmg, at 0m-5m, 200dmg from 10m-15m, 100dmg 15m-20m 0dmg &gt;20m
   3. damage(PvE), does full damage at 20m this is because damage fall off on this cant be bad

**EXOTIC 2, CITANS RAMPANTS**

* To be honest don't use it to much, so wont make any comments
   * has nothing to do with my skill with it being equal to or less then the frogs outside
* my idea
   * can aim where the barricade spawns (y axis),
   * the barricade doesn't suffer the current damage reduction instead has a crit spot in the centre of the barricade can be shot from front and back

**EXOTIC 3, CREST OF ALPHA LUPI**

* this exotic, is why?, the idea of a healing burst from summoning a barricade is a good one however it doesn't work in practice
   * this is my experience i dont know if anyone has had better luck with this exotic
   * see [Crest of Alpha VS Worm Husk, for my detailed views on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/j11gdp/crest_of_alpha_lupi_vs_wormhusk_crown_why_is_one/)
* my idea
   * these barricades are far larger,
      * going into the ground 1.5m
      * being taller, wider, (and curving around further)
      * ~~barricade is LEATHAL to enermies, (pvp)~~
      * ~~barricade pulls target acquisition (tracking, lunge etc)~~
      * spawn a buff orb for team (gun based buff and buff based on chosen barricade, rally damage, towering HP
      * rally damage buff is 25% against combatants, and 0% against guardians
      * towering gives 50% max HP and shield back on pick up, in PvE grants an over shield based on the amount of HP unused for heal lasts 6sec

**EXOTIC 4 HEART OF INMOST LIGHT**

* basically use 1 ability the other 2 become more powerful and regen faster
* this isnt a bad exotic but there is almost NO reason to drop an empowered barricade VS using it as a free ability regen buff
* my idea
   * make the empowered barricade have damage resistance to special weapons, and abilities
   * the barricade is bigger lasts longer
* this is to make the choose of summoning a barricade whilst empowered more rewarding

**Exotic 5 Icefall mantle**

* this is an great exotic, fun to use and changes how the game works but the timer and balancing aspects of the shield are a bit over bearing
* my idea
* Hold B (ability button), to deactivate the shield
* see [IceFall Mantle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/kbg8zu/can_icefall_mantle_get_a_deactivation_please/), for a full break down of my thoughts, opinions, and ideas

if you don't like these for any reason message me or comment, would it be underpowered?, useless?, overpowered?,. chances are you see an angle of this that i don't and i want to see what others opinions are."
1,Paying for DLC on 2 Systems is not good. Will Cross Play fix this?,"I played D1 on PS4.  And much of D2.  Last year I have been playing on PC, but still have friends I want to play with on PS4, but I can't pay for all the DLC twice and most is paid for on PC (some paid for on both)

I really wish Bungie would allow you to use DLC on both systems.

Anyway, if we are getting cross play this will eliminate the problem by allowing me to play with friends cross platform, but will it also let me play DLC I paid for on my PC on the PS5?

I hope so as sometimes I just want to play in 4k and others at higher FPS.  Or my son has nicked the PC!"
1,Conquer the Grandmaster Nightfall,"With Grandmaster Nightfall being right around the corner, here is general guide for players attempting to take on this ordeal. 

If you are a new player, you can get a few points or so about different loadouts, meta weapons and so on. 

If you are a solo queueing player without mic playing with random LFG teammates (like me), this guide will definitely help you since its written from exactly that point of view.

If you are a in a team/clan with friends with great coordination give it a look maybe you will learn something new!

&amp;#x200B;

I made the guide on steam heres the link -&gt; [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424271228](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424271228) . Rate and give your opinions!

&amp;#x200B;

This is a general guide. Different modifiers from seasonal artifacts, combat mods will drastically change the gameplay and associated strategies. Specific strategies for every nightfall is usually available on the internet, with some madlads even attempting it solo.

Anyways good luck on Grandmaster Nightfall this season!"
1,"If you could change the game in any way, gameplay, aesthetically, narratively, musically? What would it be?",I personally would love if the game carried the tone of the original live action trailers over to the game a little more.

1,Someday Bungie will add a giant Wyvern boss to the game and I think we need to mentally prepare ourselves for it.,It's going to happen. Most enemies in the game have a giant version as a boss somewhere in the game. It's bound to happen. And you will die. That is all.
1,So what’s the setup for Sepiks GM later today?,"I was thinking: 

Succession(Anti-Barrier)(Vorpal)
Ticcu’s Divination(Wrath of Rasputin)(Overload)
Commemoration

Revenant
Phoenix Well
Ursa Titan 

Overload Bow to me feels like the most effective way to stun overloads atm, although the arc nades are good too. 
Ticcu’s can create Warmind cells for Ad clear and simultaneously is good for single target DPS.
Succession with Vorpal reconstruction is just great in GMs especially with the distance in this nightfall in the last two areas. 
Commemoration is just for the void servitors at the end and obviously LMGs hold a ton of ammo in general. 

Thoughts?"
1,"Bungie, if you want to reduce FOMO, vaulting content is not the way to go","When this season started, Bungie said they wanted to reduce the amount of FOMO players experience. Yet just recently, they said in an interview that Forsaken content will eventually be vaulted. 

As someone who never got the chance to play Curse of Osiris and Warmind, it was really disheartening to hear that the content had been vaulted. I had to watch videos on Youtube just to understand who certain characters are and why their motives are the way they are. It almost drove me completely away from playing this otherwise amazing game.

Newer players are gonna start to feel this if more and more of the PAID expansions are completely removed from the game. I understand wanting to keep the file size down for players but straight up removing paid content is not the way to go."
1,Vault of Glass......,"So hopefully many of you are looking forward to re-running the VoG. It was my favourite raid in D1 by far, the atmosphere was incredible and the feeling the first time you’re facing Atheon and the words ‘Guardians make their own fate’ pop up when you start mastering the mechanics was amazing.

What do you think they’ll change, do you think the old strats will still be viable?

For me although I think Champions being added is a certainty I also think enemy density will be doubled given the TWAB a few weeks ago. I’m struggling to see what they will change mechanically so I’m wondering if the power cap will actually be based at the pinnacle level right off the bat. I suppose a couple more wipe mechanics is a possibility plus moving the oracles to stop you team sniping from afar. Whilst completely safe.

I can’t wait to take my Hunter in there day 1, I’m actually hoping the first few encounters may also enable me to finally make use of my Zealot’s Reward somewhere other than GoS!

See you in the cave..."
1,How Bungie should incorporate 12 man strikes/raids/dungeons,"This might be a little unfeasible but..

We double/triple the number of ads but keep the boss health in strikes/dungeons/raids (depending on encounter) the same. Each activity relies on a timer system. Every time a successful encounter is complete, your time is added to a massive data pool of other times it took to complete the encounter, and judges that time. The better your time compared to others, the more/better loot you get.

The objective becomes to burn through these PvE activities as fast as humanly possible for the best loot, and the quality of loot is dictated by your team's performance with respect to the rest of the community.

This system is fail-proof when it comes to prodigy teams that will clear encounters flawlessly because the system would be based on the community's standard deviation of clear time (ideally). Perfect runs would be considered outliers (and rewarded as such) while people trying to game the system by farming slow encounters to inundate the system with bad runs will have to spend days doing that, something virtually no one has the will power to do."
1,"The issue with the DCV is there's no garantee things removed will return/be accessable later, and no clarification that returning stuff will be the same, or changed, or even finished with Cosmodrone abandoned. Both points need addressing.","**Point 1: There is no garantee that things taken away will return at any point, due to the ""evolving nature"" of the universe, and if it did, it may come back altered from how people might want due to it.** For example, The Red War is something that happened in Destiny's history. You can't bring that back without another outright Cabal attack on the city. Ghaul is dead. Like, DEAD dead. Same issue with Oryx as another example. The Dreadnaught would need to come back in a new, adapted form, probably tied to Savathun, if at all.  


**Point 2: The Cosmodrone situation, while making sense from a development standpoint, hurts the very idea of the Destiny Content Vault. How can we trust the devs to make it work when the first implementation is abandoned?** For those who do not know, the Cosmodrone was the first piece of touted content, alongside Vault of Glass, to be announced to work with this system. The idea was that part of the area would come at first, then later on the rest of the Cosmodrone would be added in a later season.   


Later on, this plan was changed, because it was not feasable to do the new content they wanted as well as this. And with the world going insane due to certain issues, this is fine. But *it hurts the very concept of the content vault to begin with.* We were informed this would be done, for nostalgia's sake, and then it was not. The Validity of the idea of returning content, is damaged.  


**What should Bungie do about it?**  
There are a few options avalible. 

**Option 1:** Set up a concrete, *feasable* plan for what will enter the DCV, what will will be added to the game FROM the DCV ETC. Set up a rotating cycle, STICK TO IT, and let the playerbase know WELL in advance (6 months or so) what will happen, what will enter it and come out so they can prepare. Also, from here on out ***make sure that what enters the game is equivilent in both quantity and quality to what leaves.*** If Forsaken is removed, add content either old or new to the level of Forsaken.  


**Option 2:** Next generation consoles, such as the PS5 and the Series X, allow for the player to seperate different parts of game content such as multiplayer and single player in a game. Bungie could make use of this and turn the Destiny Content Vault into an ala carte system regarding former content. The details of this could vary. Perhaps old content could be added as you wish. Perhaps Bungie could have a B Team working on keeping the old content compatable with new. I don't know for sure.  


**Option 3:** Go ""Fuck it, this was a terrible idea, bring it all back."" Focus massively on downsizing the file size of Destiny while returning said content. Take the oppotunity to use the latest compression techniques or whatever. Streamline the UI and content to work better and explain itself well despite the possibly overwhelming level of content.  


**Option 4:** Ignore the issues here with DCV and hope it all goes away when you show off Witch Queen. Much like the titular bad guy, use deception to pretend the DCV does not have any issues, and people are confused by simple concepts like having too much content. Assume your playerbase are morons (And considering the amount of people who shoot at immune sheilds who can blame you) and dumb everything down, while saying it's all about player choice and making that simple."
1,Hello. I've run DSC 40 times.,"I got my second eyes of tomorrow and pretended I didn't.  I didn't pick it up. I didn't say anything. 

😭 I didn't want to hurt my friends feelings considering I already got one in January. 

I just had to tell someone."
1,Just curious is there anyone skipping every pvp and gambit challenge?,"Just had a conversation with a friend of mine who also skipped every pvp and gambit challenge, he made some interesting points.

He read all datamined challenges at the start of the season, then just decided to skip every crucible and gambit challenge.

He said: If you have the capability and you enjoy pvp, go for it. If you don’t, why bother? If pvp is so unenjoyable, you are basically working doing these challenges. You are paid an in game currency for the unpleasant experience. Because ideally games should challenge you and make you want to play more, then you have fun and get the reward. In this way, you are playing, not working.

So I also decided to stop caring about the rest of the pvp and gambit challenges, then I just felt a burden lift off my shoulder."

Holy shit. 

I barely even have to shoot my gun, I for once actually feel “strong” lighting everything on fire, chaining abilities, and exploding warmind cells.

1,Crota’s Bane Ghost Shell Drop Conditions?,"I know that the Crota’s Bane Ghost shell drops from Tier V Alters of Sorrow completions, however I am not sure about 2 things:-

1. It shows as unknown in my collection, can something listed as unknown still drop?

2. Is it tied to a specific boss or can all 3 of them drop it?

Thanks a bunch in advance for any advice!"
1,how about they just make 12 man versions of the current raids?,"doing the 12 man raids have been really fun. but some encounters have been a bit of a pain with 12 people like some spots in garden and some in last wish. so they can still be somewhat difficult among the chaos. but obviously its boss dps thats making it get patched because its literally doubling normal intended damage. but I feel like that could be easily fixed. now some mechanics definitely would need to be adjusted for 12 people like garden tethers wont go beyond 6 people, but how about they just raise the bosses health by either double or a little less than that for a 12 man version? or if thats still to little which I feel like might be the case just raise it higher. 

kind of like in monster hunter the more people that join you raises the monsters maximum health. and it can either make it easier or harder depending on the monster and what kind of player you are. and some people really needed 12 man raids to push them to finally do one. and with their removal they might feel unmotivated to do them again. and you don't want players to feel like they cant participate. not knowing how to do a activity that mostly consists of players that already know what to do, and only ever want those same players can be overwhelming and discouraging to those who've never done one. but 12 man raids allows inexperienced players to still participate without feeling like a burden to the team. I think it would cool to see something like this happen."

1,"The current matchmaking in Destiny leaves a lot to be desired for players like me. While I appreciate the challenges, it can be both mentally and emotionally exhausting to constantly be placed in unbalanced teams when I solo-queue.","[Example: 1](https://imgur.com/a/IhQZj2J)

[Example: 2](https://imgur.com/a/jWm0MSn)

[Example: 3](https://imgur.com/a/XsPw0y2)

Even when I win it’s still a struggle. 

[Example: 4](https://imgur.com/a/QS69C17)

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t blame my teammates. They’re performing at their best and I understand that. What I don’t get is why teams are formed so poorly, especially when there isn’t even a stack on the other team. 

These were all games I played where I was trying to have “fun” using guns like Night Watch, Mida Multi-Tool, Polaris Lance, Eternal Blazon, Mida Mini-Tool, Multimach CCX and Ikelos_SMG_V1.0.2. The guns were all so incredibly satisfying to use. I had a blast getting kills and streaks with them. The part that bothers me is that my teammates all seem to struggle so much regardless of how I choose to play. Whether I stick with them and team shot, or play like I normally would nothing seems to make a difference. 

Running with at least one friend usually alleviates the problem, but why shouldn’t I be able to have a balanced match while solo too?

I really hope Bungie makes some matchmaking changes in the future. My purse wasn’t made for this."

1,"Thank you, Destiny community🙏🙏","This is no sarcasm post or anything. 

Genuinely thank you for helping me overcome my depression and not letting me consume to my own dark time(was in bad state when I found this game, diagnosed with stomach issues, further testing showed that I only had one kidney by birth). 
My parents didn’t showed their pain, but I could feel their sadness. That week went in like what Eris felt when she was alone and lost her fireteam in crota’s end. But somehow she survived. 

I found this game same week when I was in bed for straight two days, not because of pain, because of feeling that my life just started (bye got married like an year ago before I diagnosed with that), so was really down. 

Had no guide or any idea or didn’t watched any videos about this game, just saw this game and had no idea why I bought this (1st game that I bought without watching any reviews). 

Thanks to all Those random guardians who helped me get my ikelos shotgun when it was staple for pve content, those 8 peoples got the shotty within couple of hours and me and one more guardian was the only who didn’t. But still stuck around for another couple of hours until we all got the shotty. 🙏 thanks to all those guardians.

🙏thanks to those guardians who got me through my 1st ever raid, The last wish, and didn’t used any kind of annoyed or bad words when I screwed up so many times, rather than they joked and joked and joked about it. At the end I got 1000 voices one my 1st last wish😂, our Sherpa who had completed the raid like 30+ times and didn’t had the 1000voices, he screamed so loud that riven must’ve came back alive😂, but at the end he was happy for me, than we did EoW and leviathan raids too that night. 
One of the best nights I had spent in past of couple of months. 

Sorry for long post, but Just a simple thank you to everyone in the community who have helped me in every aspect of game, those randoms, those lfg peoples, my clan mates and everyone.🙏🙏 

God bless every single guardian and hope I get a chance to help atleast one guardian the same way this community helped me.👍🏻🙂🙏"

1,don't forget to get your 12-man activities done while you can before they stop being possible with the launch of Grandmaster Nightfalls,"as the title states, 12-man activities that have been all the rage recently, will be patched this reset with the arrival of Grandmaster Nightfalls, since Bungie doesn't want people having it too easy with them, so get into some as soon as you can to complete stuff you need or just for fun before we're unable to do them in their current form, although hopefully bungie has seen our desires for 12-man activities and thus creates new ones for later on in the game's life"
1,An actual Sanguine Alchemy build," So while doing some Nightfall runs this week, I got one to drop with a pretty decent recovery stat... so, I decided to try it out- cause ever since the rework I never bothered to touch it.  
So for those who don't know what it does now... while in a rift, if you get a kill... you get a buff of x1 that pauses your rift timer for a few seconds. At x5, it pauses your rift for 15 seconds before continuing it's current timer. And you can refresh that buff repeatedly and basically have a perma rift at all times.  


I figured it was... niche and pointless... but I decided to try and make a build that could solo all the Alters of Sorrow up to the boss.  
*BEHOLD MY CREATION OF BORDEOM...* as it's mostly just a Warmind Cell build. **But it works.**  


Bottom Tree Voidwalker  
Sanguine Alchemy  
Max Recovery (incase you ever lose your rift)  
Global Reach / Wrath of Rasputin / Rage of the Warmind  
Charged with Light Mod: Blast Radius / Protective Light  
Witherhoard  
Any Ikelos/Seraeph Energy Primary  
A rocket with Lasting Impression  


Find your spot, plop yourself down a rift of your choice (preferably Empowering cause you have Devour healing and Protective Light), consume your grenade for healing on kill... fire Witherhoard at the entry way... swap to your primary and spawn Cells... blow up said cells, fire rocket at boss.  
The damage buff from Rift combined with Witherhoard... and Alchemy... you'll never leave your rift as that damage buff lets you nuke everything. And if you have to... ya got your super. And Warmind Cells because **why not it's not like they're stupidly broken or anything...**  


Is this build practical? No, it's still very situational but... it at least makes use of the exotic in some way. **AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE TRYING TO MAKE USE OF THIS STUPID THING AFTER THE REWORK.**"

1,Probably time for Status effects to be fleshed out more.,"Title.
Sorry if this is all over the place don't post much and have been wanting to spit ball this out there.

I've been thinking about this since last season, but it would be a good time for status effects as a whole become more define and common. Similar to other games in the genre. I.e. Division, warframe, diablo, etc.,

For example,

Stasis/Ice/ Space Crystallization; Has the effect to slow and freeze your target. Personally, other than the nerfs it's receiving, I agree with most people that it should reduce accuracy. (Instead I think handling is fine, fits the theme and power fantasy and maybe even affect ROF but that could be to much.) 

The other sub classes status effects (burn, suppress, and whatever the f*** acr does) definitely could use love. Like burning being similar to the new exotic bow or Arc actually affecting your speed.

Side note: Based off this blog post slow on its own is definitely doing too many effects against the player that could be split to other statuses like maybe idk...the new poison sub....👀"

Do you guys have any recommendation on good PVP mods. I know high energy fire is a must have, but unsure what else to include.

Thanks guys"
1,Is This “Season Of The Plague” Stuff Going On On Twitter A Real Teaser Or A Fun Fan Thing?,"I’ve seen a new account pop up and many MANY Destiny related accounts (news, streamers, Youtubers, etc.) start going along with this SIVA oriented Season of the Plague promotions on Twitter. I was wondering if this was just a fun, fan made event going on or is this a real teaser for something that will actually happen? The date May 5th keeps being tossed around as a reveal for something. Wondering if anyone had any more information on this."
1,I just decrypted an exotic engram into... an enhancement core...,Uhh... what just happened?
1,How should first timers experience Vault of Glass?,"No spoilers please.

I, and likely thousands of others, have zero knowledge of vault of glass as we never played D1.

Day one contest mode could be fun but would spoil any first time fun by watching D1 videos while prepping.  A full blind run could be great if the mechanics are fun and challenging but not frustrating.  Maybe just a chill Sherpa run?

Thoughts?"
1,100k nightfall no pinnacle,"Hey guys. This is the 2nd week in a row where ive gotten 100k on a nightfall on multiple times with no completion. Is this a bug or am i missing something here? Did on 1270 hero matchmaking, stayed until the very end from the start.  Am i missing something or is this a known bug?"
1,How do I get more into the game?,"So I play mainly Strikes, which I find really fun, however the loot seems pretty repetitive and I feel that I’m missing out on a lot of cool stuff to do and stuff to get! 

I’ve done a few dungeon runs before, and enjoyed it, but it’s difficult to find people to play with and it’s kind of stressful playing with random players! 

I have all DLCs except Beyond Light, what can I do to get new stuff and feel like I’m working towards something?"

1,Does pulse monitor proc kill clip?,Title
1,"My clanmates laughed 2 seasons ago, when I masterworked my high stat Aeon Cult set. Guess what exotics they want me to use for Grandmaster tomorrow!","[https://imgur.com/a/ymKegKb](https://imgur.com/a/ymKegKb)

To be fair, we ran a shitload of double loot Lake of Shadows, and were masterworking just about anything in the vault.  

For some reason, the game likes giving me high stat/high distribution Aeons.  When these things were a meme, I was deleting 66+ rolls, 20+ distribution pieces simply because I had these in the vault collecting dust.

They deleted their Aeons, because after all....... who would ever use Aeons!  Now that they're buffed, all of a sudden I've become everyone's Grandmaster buddy knowing I can produce ammo for the team."
1,Bungo Pls: Continue to release new exotics with their catalyst shortly after!,[removed]
1,Throwback to the good old days of super chaining in strikes.,https://streamable.com/pr73b5
1,(Royal Entry) Does Blast Radius MW affect Chain Reaction's explosion area?,"I have this Royal Entry roll:

Linear Compensator/Smart Drift Control

Impact Casing/Alloy Casing

Auto-loading Holster

Chain Reaction

MW Blast Radius

Here's a [picture for reference.](https://preview.redd.it/n24cwsh78bn61.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5833666d30a79440b2e6ff9535e82c5556d04dba)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, does Blast Radius affect the explosion area that is caused by Chain Reaction? Or does it only affect the initial explosion on impact? (also, does the same goes for MW Blast Radius on Cluster Bomb?)"
1,What the hell is wrong with matchmaking?,"Recently, i've been playing a lot of gambit and comp crucible, and all of my teammates are still using BLUE ARMOR AND TRASH WEAPONS LIKE A DAMN BLUE PULSE OR SCOUT RIFLE. And all of the enemies I matchmake with are sweaty warlords who still use beloved or smth else. Anyone experience the same?"
1,It would be nice to see some more variety in the reissued weapons.,"Theres so many gun models and foundries that don't see any action with each season bc of the light level. 

Just looking through the snipers, we have no at light weapons from omolon, suros, edz, or the original d2 vanguard model (persuader/domino), but yet we have 3 veist snipers currently usable from reissues from 3 separate seasons. 

These guns are in the game. It would be nice in future seasons to reissue some of these unused models to give some variation."
1,Is the taniks nova bomb glitch being patched tomorrow with the 12 man fireteam?,Or only 12 man?
1,How is my hunter build for GMs???,"My friends whom I planning on running grandmasters with tomorrow tasked me with making my setup entirely myself, only rule being no stasis.
Well after a few hours of junking and upgrading random stuff in my vault, I was able to come up wit the following;

Lvl 10 Mobility
Lvl 3 Resi
Lvl 9 Reco
Lvl 5 Disc
Lvl 3 Inte
Lvl 8 Streng

But obviously my plan with that is important, simply put omnioculus.

So therefore bottom void and essentially make everyone invisible as needed. 

As for weaponry, I’m thinking a trustee (Hot shanks, Anti Barrier) and an Anarchy (Cus anarchy)

1,Every Teaching Raid LFG Fireteam ever,"Coming from someone who hasn’t gotten a ton of clears but has been in enough groups to somewhat know what they’re talking about.

1. The Sherpa: Usually really nice, has some conservative opinions that occasionally come out but ultimately is polite and helpful.

2. The guy that has to leave after the second encounter: Usually quiet but polite, did their job well in the last 2 encounters but has to leave for some unknown reason. He will be missed.

3. The guy with 80 clears who replaced the guy who left: Every time someone leaves the person who replaces them is always the same quiet monotone guy with a shit ton of clears. Can sometimes be a bit rude but will always pick up for other people slack when they accidentally mess up. Will leave the fireteam without a word once the raid is finished.

4. The Irish/Scottish guy: There’s always atleast one. Usually nice and who you get paired with for any mechanics involving 2 people working in tandem. Would dap him up any day of the week.

5. The Asshole: Gets mad at everyone for messing up despite it being a teaching run, and him messing up just as much as everyone else. Kills the vibe and when he gets frustrated everyone just goes silent until he inevitably just quits and everyone starts laughing and clowning him for being a cunt.

6. Sherpa’s Friend: Knows the mechanics just as well as the sherpa, but doesn’t interrupt when the Sherpa is teaching everyone else. Just as helpful and polite as the Sherpa albeit more quiet. 

Did I get it right?"
1,Today Crow murdered another big profile guardian,"This is my favorite interaction yet, crow says something about our guardian's resolve to which Saladin passive aggressively answers that he wishes all guardians had that conviction, Crow ask if that's directed to him because he's overseeing the operation to which Saladin says:

""We didn't had the time for idle chatter in my time, doubt Zavala approved it during the red war either""

Crow answers:

""Sorry I'm new, I don't know yet all our history. Tell me, what were you doing during the red war?""

Saladin then proceeded to rage quit the chat and break his headset"
1,Solo'ing Dungeons on Titan,"I am coming down from the high of Solo Flawless Prophecy as I type this. After 20 tries on my Titan main, switched to my Warlock and oh man, its just an entirely different game. I really wish Titans had a more capable/better-suited exotic/subclass for Solo content. Devour and Contraverse did so much more for me than Hallowfire Heart + Bottom Tree Sunbreaker. Is there a more-worthy Solo Titan build? Did Icefall shake anything up for Solo titan PVE?"

1,Melee builds shouldn't be punished by exploding enemies and shields,"Disincentives aren't balance. Being forced to run away from the enemies and go back to shooting because of a few cursed thrall ruins the point of a melee build. There are two very, very easy fixes for this:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Let melee kills knock the target away, just like finishers do. This would be freaking funny to watch, too.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Let melee attacks against physical shields damage the wearer. You \*\*\*really\*\*\* think a garbage can lid is gonna protect that little scorn from a titan's Burning Fists x5 Knockout punch of doom? I think not."
1,I want to use every weapon I own each season. Not just the ones limited to artifact mods.,[removed]
1,What exactly does the final lever in Presage do?,The one in the room with the raid banner circle. I can't seem to figure out what it does or if it's even necessary.
1,Please Add a Catch-up Mechanism for the Captain’s Log Lore Book,"The Bound in Memory triumph is required for the Chosen seal, which requires all Captain’s Log lore pages.

1,Man. Bows suuuuck in pvp,"Started up the quest to get Ticcus catalyst. Getting 50 kills with that POS (in pvp at least) really reminded me why I only use them for the memes in pvp. The ttk on these things is pathetically low, i get killed by just about every single other weapon before I can even nock a killing blow. Irritates me how a clearly PVE based weapon is gated by pvp"
1,What is Surrounded's current damage buff? Is it still 55%?,"I saw this was back in 2018, don't know if it's been changed or not."
1,Best Place To Farm Perfect Fifth Kills For Polaris Lance Catalyst?,"Just wondering where the best place to farm the perfect fifth kills needed to complete this catalyst. I know castellum used to be the best but has since been vaulted. I have tried the thrallway but since burn damage is needed for it to count, I was unable to find a way to not instakill them. Any suggestions would be appreciated and thanks for the help :)"
1,I just wanna give a huge shout-out to Borealis.,"After completing the catalyst for this gun, I kinda just threw it into my vault...thats until anti barrier sniper came out, and now, as a warlock main, whenever I feel handicapped with the unfamiliarity with my hunter, I can breeze through legend lost sectors that has servitors as champs and not worry about Match Game.

I've underestimated just how strong it is once the perk has been activated. This sniper is now my baby and shall not leave my side."
1,Ishrar commander not working?,"I just downloaded this and logged in, all I see is a picture of a planet, anyone know what I'm doing wrong?"
1,An automated lifetime ban without warning or explanation is poor customer service.,"One of my clanmates for the last few years got banned for life and it makes me angry at Bungie. 

He was running a 3rd party task manager app on his spare PC and booted up Destiny on that machine for the first time in years. He was banned within 30 minutes. No reason was given and he filed his appeal assuming this was the issue. He has thousands of hours in game and bought every DLC from D1 to now, bought Eververse items, and bought quite a few of the physical rewards from the Bungie store. I looked up his recent activity to see if he was doing anything suspect in his last activity but it was just nightfall farming (3 man). 

I am aware that such programs are forbidden in Bungie's code of conduct, but its an honest mistake. 

The appeal was closed almost exactly one calendar week from submission, which leads me to assume it was automated. 

This player has no history of suspensions, no sketchy crucible results, no toxic behavior. Any human reviewing the ban could have applied common sense to see that someone this invested in the game would never knowingly risk that a permanent ban. 

Once the appeal was denied, there is nowhere else to go. 

I know I'll get negative comments for whining and people defending Bungie's right to do whatever they want with their product. But I bet you'd be pretty pissed if your account was banned for an innocent mistake and all of your purchases were gone."
1,"So, about how seasonal content is staying for a year: Is each activity actually staying for a YEAR, or just until the next expansion?","Apology if this has been asked before

The definitions are basically the same for Wrathborn hunts, but it won't be for the other seasonal activities this year, and I don't think very many people care for Wrathborn hunts anyway

What I mean is, will Battlegrounds stick around until season 16? Will whatever is slated for S15 stay until S18?"
1,As someone who stopped playing after Oryx....,"Where on earth do I decrypt all these umbra engrams I’m getting? And does it cost resources to decrypt them? Thank you. 

I will say this game has improved quite a bit since I played it."
1,How exactly does Frenzy work?,It seems like every time I notice it on my screen is after I've killed the enemies in the room.
1,Looking to spruce up a man cave.,"Does anyone know a company that does custom prints of images to put on walls? Looking to add some flair to the man cave.

Secondly, would anyone know if it’s possible to get pictures of the Director maps without icons? 

The end goal here is that I have a picture of the Cosmodrome map (maybe among others) hanging on a frame on the wall right next to some real maps."
1,Would it break the game if we got rid of kinetic/energy slot locked weapons?,"Like what if every primary/special weapon could go in either slot? I feel like that would be a great QOL choice in response to the lack of kinetic special weapon options. I also don't really see a need for balancing loadouts based on damage type slots. 

I see a few ways of doing this:

1) Leave all guns as they are and let people use 2 energies/2 kinetics

Pros:
- easier to implement
- guns stay familiar
Cons:
- potentially devalues kinetics (though they would still do more damage to unshielded enemies)
- kinda defeats perks like Osmosis



2) Give all guns an element and have it only be active in the energy slot

Pros:
- keeps the kinetic/energy dynamic
- makes energy choice more meaningful than option 1
Cons:
- potentially harder to implement (but not by much probably)
- might break perks specific to energy weapons
- not sure what a normal kinetic fusion rifle would look like (as bastion fires slugs but normal FRs do not)



Let me know what you think"
1,I hope VoG's Loot Matches the Modern Standards for Appearance,"The original VoG weapons were just standard weapon models with a bronze shader, the armour sets were basic (aot had great ornaments though), and the ships, sparrow and ghost are all basic shaders applied to a standard model. I really hope that the appearance of the more basic items are updated to look unique. I want to see weapons in the style of the AoT ornaments. I doubt this will happen though."
1,"Having issues with friends showing up in the friends list in game, (PS4). Issue has been occurring for the past month and a half.","Simple as title says, its been a month and a half where mt friends will show up on the friends list on the PS4 Itself, but when in Destiny 2 only some of my friends show up yet if I check if they are online it says there are and on D2 yet they don't show up on my friends list on PS4 in game in D2. 

I don't know how to fix so I am asking the subreddit here if there is a solution."
1,Why console players still have to pay the ps plus?,"Brother, I've been playing for a long time and yet what really surprises me is that destiny 2 is not free to play on the basics inside consoles.
Some will say that it is not much per month but in Argentina for example it is quite the case, so much so that I and a friend pay it. It would be great if we could come together as a community ina good way and be able to end this because what breaks my heart the most is not being able to help any new player because they don't have ps plus"

Fuck gambit."
1,Destiny old head that got new joy from Season Of The Chosen,"I will start this with saying that I’ve been playing off and on since the Alpha of Destiny 1. (Titan main for days) I love these games! Bungie is responsible for my love of the FPS genre. I’ve had spots here and there where I lost interest with the game. But I always came back fairly quickly. Until the Forsaken expansion. I just started to not enjoy myself when I played the game. The grind felt pointless, unrewarding and in some cases punishing. I tried my hardest to soldier through, but I just couldn’t bring myself to struggle with the monotony. Fellow guardians of my fire team came and went. I was alone with no urge to forge forward. So I stopped, until Season Of The Chosen was released. 

For some reason i booted up the game randomly a few weeks ago. Now I’ve gotten a new lease on this game. Much to my surprise, it’s fun again. Now I’m not saying it’s perfect by any means. But the grind and the hunt is much more enjoyable. Rewarding, meh. Fun and enjoyable, sure. 

Gaming has gotten me through many of my life’s events. Destiny being a big part of that escape from reality we all need. The root of this post is just a thank you. To Bungie for making a great world for us to inhabit and explore. My fellow guardians that were random fill or LFG’d and fought by my side. 

Thanks for the help. In more ways then I can count. 

Take care, and I’ll see you star side guardians. 

A friendly Titan"
1,I would love a Pot O’ Gold or 4-leaf Clover Ghost Shell for St. Patrick’s Day,Or a flying sparrow (similar to that of Brumeswept Night) that puts us on a cloud with a rainbow with a Pot of gold at the end of it. Because I don’t think St. Patrick’s Day has received any love from the cosmetics department in Destiny 2 (correct me if I’m wrong).
1,Made Some Weapon Models in 3D,"Hello,

I've just been practicing ye ol' 3D art and decided to use some awesome concepts from @Tosthage on Twitter for practice (The weapons are entirely her creation, I I just 3D-ified them). Don't see too many art posts here generally so I thought I'd throw mine into the mix.

1,Possible Lost sector Loot Bug.,"Grinded out about 22ish Concealed Void runs at 1300 for helmets on my warlock today. 

First four runs got 1 exotic to drop, my engrams were full feels bad, it went to the postmaster.

I clear my engram space and get a Stag helemts like 5 or so runs laters. Back into and around run 18/19 get another exotic drop bit my inventory is full and it goes to postmaster again.  I feel bad that the farming g sucked today and go and grab from postmaster.

**I was running Legends for exotics helmets.**So that's what I expected from the engrams. They both decrypted Into mantle of battle harmony, **the exotic chest piece.**

On the moon the master lost sector is dropping chest exotics. 

Clearly this and to be a mistake. Out of 3 runs I the Lost sector getting an exotic drop. 1 was actually a hel.et and the two that got sent to the postmaster. Decided they wouldn't be Crown of tempest drops I'd be proud of an instead made me even more dissapointed.

Not sure if Bungie or anyone else has ran into this issue. But clearly there's a big happening

**TL;DR , of 3 exotic drops I got from farming  the legend lost sector for helmets only 1 dropped as an exotic helm when decrypted at completion. The other two got sent to postmaster and decrypted into exotic chest pieces, coincidentally what the master lost sector is offering**"

1,Bungie can we get a shotgun nerf?,"One of the most annoying things in the game is how if you're barely scratched now a Felwinter can kill you form like 13 meters no requirements, shotguns just way too strong and maybe the same way you did away with 150s you should do away with aggressive shotguns."
1,Returning Player help,"Hello, 

I haven't played destiny since they implemented the Menagerie, so about Summer 2019. At the current state of the game, is it worth it to go back to Destiny 2 as a casual player, trying to get exotic loot and stuff? Menagerie was the peak of Destiny 2 in my opinion, I loved it so much. Is there an activity in Destiny 2 right now that tops the Menagerie? 

Also, would I have to buy both shadowkeep and beyond light?"
1,Article 12: Destiny 2's 12 Man Activity Glitch Needs To Be A Feature In The Future,"Hello Guardians! Super busy with school stuff lately, been slacking on the articles. I would appreciate any feedback you have to offer to learn and improve! As usual, an external link is provided should you prefer to read it on WordPress (pictures are viewable there). 

[https://mysticaridia.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/destiny-2s-12-man-activity-glitch-needs-to-be-a-feature-in-the-future/](https://mysticaridia.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/destiny-2s-12-man-activity-glitch-needs-to-be-a-feature-in-the-future/) 

**Destiny 2's 12 Man Activity Glitch Needs To Be A Feature In The Future**

Between the interesting unfolding of the Battlegrounds, there has been an extremely fun aspect these past 2 weeks. I am speaking of no other than 12-man activities. With some precise timing and luck, players have been breezing through several activities in more Fireteams than intended, and my oh my, has it been a blast. This glitch only works with non-matchmade activities, so thank the Traveller you won't be facing a team of 12 in Control, Gambit, or Trials (which is disabled, again).

It's the last day of 12-man activities in *Destiny 2*, as Update 3.1.1 will be patching this on weekly reset. Bungie needs to make 12-man activities a thing in the future. While I don't mean that they should launch every of the upcoming activities, for example the returning Vault of Glass with room for 12 players. However there is a certain aspect of fun and chaos to it, call it Mayhem Mode, if you will. 

Most activities in the game are set to Fireteam members of 3 and 6, but having an extra Fireteam or two has never been more glorious. The filled to the brim roster page, the sheer number of Guardians in a small room, how quickly enemies can be defeated, even the other way around (looking at you, Exploder Shank from Fallen S.A.B.E.R), and have I told you of how hilarious it is to stomp a Fallen Skiff down? 

This has been a great way for new players to try out various non-matchmade endgame activities too, I've lost count of the numbers of 12-man raids I've joined where several were raiding for the very first time as they looked around in awe of what a raid has to offer. As RNG would have it, some lucky ones were blessed with the raid Exotics on their first try. It easily brought a more welcoming feeling to them to try more of these activities, no matter how little the participation.

12-man Fireteams have also brought cheeses to several Triumphs, such as the Tale Told Triumph in the Exotic Quest: Presage. Players have to complete the mission on Master difficulty without dying, but you can easily sit at spawn while the 11 other Guardians in your Fireteam breeze through the mission. With it rewards a lovely Tex Mechanica themed emblem.  

Props to Bungie for letting the glitch stick around for players to have fun for a while rather than patching it immediately. Bungie could either have the option to create an activity for 12-man Fireteams, but that may be tricky in terms of mechanics as you'd have to factor in so many Guardians, not to mention how quickly you could melt a boss’ health. While I do understand that these endgame activities are a source of high stat loot and resources, that it may break the reward structure if 12-man Fireteams were active all the time, I would love to see a return of it for the sake of players who face difficulties in tackling them and for some much enjoyed fun. 

I believe the appeal is more towards the fact that *Destiny 2* players miss and want a 6 player matchmade activity. I know I have complimented the targeted loot farm back in Menagerie several times, the Menagerie also had casual fun for all its players. Back then, players would be able to farm multiple copies of any weapon/gear they desired after a glitch was discovered by loading back and forth between areas. Being able to load into an activity with 12 people has somewhat effectively filled the experience of Menagerie’s absence. 

If this 12-man glitch were ever to return in the future, there’s several possibilities that Bungie could add. Additional modifiers, harder difficulties, exclusive challenges and perhaps exclusive loot and mods! You may recall in April 2020, a double loot glitch from the Nightfall Warden of Nothing had eventually turned into a feature where we periodically get double loot from Nightfalls, so here's hoping that 12-man activities will have the same fate. 

Until then, treasure the remaining time of this unique glitch we have left Guardians, and an early good luck to those who will be attempting Grandmaster difficulty on reset."
1,maybe we already know who the darkness statue is.,"so i was reading into the strangers timeline stuff and found the whole corrupted Eris stuff super interesting. she essentially becomes the posterchild of the darkness. we know the forces of light and dark have some prophetic abilities, maybe they used them to know about this future and how she uses the dark powers, so they made it in her image. I'm clutching at straws with this last part but it is a feminine figure draped in some kind of covering, maybe this is like an evolution to the eye covering she wears or something. there's not exactly a whole lot of evidence for this but I think it'd be cool if this was the case. Maybe evil Eris used some sol divisive tech to plant the pyramid on the moon in the past, guarantee the dark transformation or something. even if this is just some crack theory, its an interesting idea."
1,Transmog on the horizon,"With transmog coming up can any of you beautiful content creators make a somewhat easy to understand guide for good looking pieces/shaders. The couple I’ve seen out there already have been a little over detailed, and therefore not very helpful. I’d like to see someone list out some good looking shaders that are obtainable, and list out a few of the best looking armor sets for each class. Idk how everyone’s hunter looks sick and mine always looks like a tool. If there’s any great videos out there please post the link, or if there’s no good videos, someone please make one. Sincerely, monochromatic season pass ornaments guy 



Side question about the shaders, I know they’re switching to where once you get them you just have them, but will that include shaders we’ve earned in the past and used? Or only ones we currently have any amount of. Example if I previously had leviathan shaders but already used them will those be available for me to use in the new system?"

It feels like they’ve created so many weapons and armor pieces and abilities and there’s just no way to manage them all. So many of these things are blatantly useless. Also some things are just straight up better than everything else, which seems like very poor balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Spawning into supers, spawning into enemies. Supers are essentially free kills. Being able to “add aim assist and accuracy” is such a beyond strange concept to me- you can just put a mod on and it compensates for inability to aim? 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole of PvP just feels like there should be a huge “Beta” sticker slapped on it. It’s fine when people are better than me, and there definitely are a lot of people! But a lot of the time I just feel like there’s absolutely nothing I could have done to not get one shot by something, which happens so so often. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not even mentioning there are like 3 maps, matchmaking is actually laughable.. also you have an astonishing number of people “win trading” in PvP because they want the rewards from something that is so painful to play. (Which is definitely lame, not a fan of win trading obviously.)

 I really need to know how anyone can have fun playing this! Even when I do well I’m not having fun!"
1,"Bungie I don't know if your metadata tells you this but most of the PVE and PVP kills are while the ""I WANT TO BREAK FREE"" is playing","Just let us break free during with a sprint, so many Darkness Priestess empire hunts have ended with me dying to her because I was in an animation while being hit by vandals with pikes."
1,"Rant: Polaris lance catalyst ""fifth perfect kills"" is terrible","Not only is it a pain to have to hunt down an activity to where I can get 5 heads shots without someone stealing the kill, but the explosion more so often than not kills the enemy making the 5 headshots worthless... THEN if the explosion doesn't kill them, the freaking burn doesn't last long enough to get the kill. This might be the worst catalyst step ever. 

I've been playing for hours and have only gotten 10-15 perfect fifth kills. Been at Shuro Chi for a bit and have only gotten 4. I can see why I stopped pursuing this catalyst."
1,Bungo It’s Time to Talk About Heavys,"First off, thanks for making great heavy weapons. But there’s a serious issue with the current state of your heavy weapons. ALL except two DPS heavys are solar! Legendary and exotic. For solar there’s: lament, xeno, code duello, and eyes. Let’s not forget the highest dps weapon in the game: whisper. The only two that aren’t solar: Anarchy and Darker Drinker.

Please Bungie fix this. And I don’t mean change weapon damage type. Just keep it in mind next time you want to drop a nasty heavy exotic or legendary."
1,Ikelos SMG roll,"So I just got my first Ikelos SMG... and it felt AMAZING! Way better than Extraordinary Rendition who everyone’s talking about right now

Now I have this roll:

-Smallbore
-Flared Magwell
-Dynamic sway reduction
- Surrounded

MW: Handling

Im not a fan of the MW, and I believe there should be something better than Surrounded... but it still feels pretty great!

Should I masterwork this roll? Or is it not good enough and I shoukd wait for another

Also... I understand Extraordinary Rendition with Frenzy is great (I have one), but this one still feels better and generates warmind cells, so wouldnt it be the better option? (In addition to being able to pair with Heritage/Izanagi/Witherhoard/etc)"
1,Back up,Can I request back up here?
1,Rivensbane triumphs,"I was trying to finish some triumphs for rivensbane, did the all void one and had no problems. loaded it up again to do arc and only at the end of the raid we realized we didn’t get any progress for the triumph (thunderstruck). we restarted and tried solar and it still didn’t work. Anyone know anything. and yes i checked everyone before and the group I played with are friends."
1,Legend lost sector,"I have been grinding legendary lost sectors solo at 1300 for the new exotic armors, and all im getting is 3 herealways pieces. I havent gotten a single legendary armor piece or weapon let alone an exotic. What am i doing wrong?"
1,"Everyone wants more foundry weapons, what about more foundry armor?","The Moonfang set you get from the prophecy dungeon looks awesome on my hunter and immediately became my favorite armor set, having the Daito logo printed all over it is what makes it have more character imo. Bungie should definitely think of adding more foundry based armor from foundries like Hakke or Omolon. I’d kill for something like a Tex Mechanica cowboy set."
1,Can concealed void be taken out of the lost sector rotation until it's fixed please,It's really annoying to face overload captains already but it's even more annoying to face one that regens almost constantly and does not get stunned. And the Anti-barrier servitor teleports underneath the platform while also keeping the dregs and shanks above immune. Can we please get some kind of hotfix on these guys?
1,"New player, a little lost"," Hey, looking for a little guidance, have read/watched beginner guides but still a little lost.

What I've done so far:

New light quest

Random bounties/strikes to contribute toward random quests I picked up in the tower

A couple other random quests in my log (went to EDZ for a little)

Now I'm sitting in the tower with 40 quests and a stack of bounties wondering wtf to do next. All the guides recommend doing original campaign first but obviously that has been removed. For xpacs I have Forsaken and Beyond Light. Should I do Forsaken campaign? Any guidance/recommendations are appreciated!"
1,Can I play destiny 1 for free beyond trails mode,Just want to know because I am still installing destiny 1 for in Xbox one and I really want to know if there is a way to get full access to all of destiny 1’s content (not dlc content)
1,Can someone explain this to me (elemental capacitor),Ok so I have the perk elemental capacitor on my HC I’m wondering if the stats are boosted already because I have a roll with literally max reload ( with no reload mod ) and max handling with 77 stability
1,I have a question about a particular Shotgun.,"Here in Destiny 2, we've had many broken things in the past, and many broken things now. An example: Lord of Wolves, Recluse, Mountaintop, One Eyed Mask, Contraverse Hold, Backup plan Fusion Rifles, Arbalest, Jötunn. Granted, most of those things were nerfed and/or are sunset. But here in the current meta we have Felwinters Lie. A shotgun pinned to an 8.5m OHK range with Opening Shot active, where it's only redeeming quality is consistency. While we still have Fusion Rifles like Glacioclasm running around and Jötunn. So why is everyone complaining about a Shotgun pinned to 8.5m when a Fusion Rifle can consistently kill at 15-20m and even farther with the right role? Maybe I'm bias, as I don't find myself dying to Felwinters as often as others. But just a thought. Don't attack me lol."
1,Postmaster Frustration,"Lemme start by saying I'll accept my part of the blame for not watching my postmaster closely. My bad.

That being said, losing 100+ enhancement prisms and ALMOST losing 7 Ascendant Shards (thank goodness I caught it) is really frustrating.

Why is there no inbox priority? Is it really so hard to code ""x exotic/legendary = greater value than rare item""?

Why doesn't the postmaster have more space? After playing the Blucible, Gamblue and Blueguard Strikes, my postmaster can fill up without noticing. 

Why can't I put prisms and shards into the vault?

Dismantling them makes gunsmith materials, which you turn into gunsmith and if the gun isn't good, you dismantle it into more gunsmith materials, which is a different issue all on its own.

I remember in D1, after you reached a cartain point, white /green engrams would just auto decrypt into materials. Can we get that after hitting pinnacle cap? Or maybe even a toggle? I'm getting so bored of holding ""dismantle.""

Bungie has demonstrated some amazing Quality of Life changes. I think the postmaster needs some love too.

I love this game a little too much and I'm excited to see where it's headed."
1,Game breaking bug,"UX/UI bugged for anyone else?

This issue is happening on a PS4:

When I try to equip a weapon or piece of armor it doesn’t equip. It stalls for a second then the item disappears. If you close the the menu, the item is back but your original load out is still on. 

If you try to delete an item, it doesn’t delete it just stalls and never deletes. 

It happens when turning in bounties, as you finish the the button hold, the bounty enters the animation but stalls and never turns in. 

When I go to unlock a perk on the artifact, it upgrades the perk I pick, it unlocks but then when I try to unlock the next the unlock never cycles through. This is frustrating because I just reset it to experiment with different builds and I needed to do the EXO master challenge for an aspect. 

But, even if I was able to unlock a new perk, I can’t equip it because whenever I go to a piece of armor to change the mods, they act like they are changing during the button hold but the mod turns white and never applies. 

I can grab bounties and change my load out via Ishtar and the Destiny app so I can still play some content except when I want to change my class/sub-class, it just stalls when you select the new one. Cool, I’m stuck running voidwalker, I’ll just run out some mindless battlegrounds, work on some catalysts. 

But, I can’t do that because when I go to socket my hammer, you guess it, I hold down X and the Medallion goes white and just stays there and never sockets. 

I tried resetting as well as turning off my PS, still doing it. I even thought it might be lag in my internet so I did a hard reset as well.

Tell me I’m not the only one who is experiencing this? I scuffed the most recent posts and didn’t see anyone mentioning it. Sorry if they are already aware.

This is now two days I have not been able to play the game. Who do I contact? I just checked again and still the same play state."
1,How to succeed in crucible for the disabled.,"Hi everyone, 

I just wanted to offer a quick guide to help anyone that maybe is having a really tough time in crucible, especially due to an illness or even limitating setups (eg can't afford an adequate gaming chair). 

Here are my tips categorized by ailment.

Cataracts/arthritis/ other barriers to aiming: might I suggest using a crispy new 120 hand cannon. The archetype comes equipped with an inherent perk allowing you to hit criticals for approximately half your opponents HP around corners, from the air, and even when aiming at the peen. 

Dementia/not fully developed brain: if you find yourself at either ends of your lifespan, it can be really hard to engage the game with a sense of strategy/foresight. So for you I would highly recommend using Hunter, whose ability to roll around on the floor will help you to survive bad situations you unwittingly walked right into. Effectively negating all repercussions for the poo poo brain mistake you should have died for, you stupid monkey. 

Additional insurance for the above medical limitations can be found in equipping stompers and a chonky Felwinters lie. For you see, both together allow you to dominate your opponents despite your lack of gunskill/positioning. 

Lastly, for those of you who are suffering from either  Erectile Dysfunction or an abnormally small penis, I believe the Darkness is offering something you might be very interested in. 

Now go forth and show everyone in quickplay how much better you are than them with these tips, you impotent buffoons. 

/s

But for feel. I love you guys and I love this game. See you all star-side."
1,Do you only get Infamy for wins?,I have not got any infamy from crucible. Of course all I’m running into are 4 stack clans who easily fuck us up. I need one more level to reset then I’m done with Gambit for the season. Grinding for the shard haha.
1,Cross save with Stadia is the best decision I ever made.,I honestly can't stress how valuable having Destiny 2 on your phone is. Example: I went on vacation recently and was away from my computer for more than a week. There were some EV items I wanted but I wouldn't have access to a capable computer. Having Stadia allowed me to shop in the EV store and even do some gunsmith bounties. A big downside is not owning expansions on Stadia but I was still able to run a couple public events.
1,Scorn season,"Where my pimple posse at? WHERE MY SCOOORN BOYS?! 

We, the undying legion and the TRUE pinnacle of Eliksni evolution are most befitting of a season dedicated to our GLORIOUS ROTTING BARONS!!! RETURN FROM THE DEAD TO REAP BLOODY VENGEANCE AGAINST THE LIGHT! 

Do you not agree REDDIT?!?!"
1,I have Autism. Thanks to 12 man raiding I have my very first Raid Lockout since 2016.,"Really personal post here, which I don't normally do. My name is Michael, and I suffer from Asbergers Sydrome, Autism, and Severe Anxiety/Depression. It causes me to avoid large player activities since I have a lot of stress about things like Mics and ""know how"" of mechanics and such. 

Over the years Bungie has hit some home runs for me in terms of an alluring activity that doesn't give me social anxiety: 

1. Court of Oryx: For me the feeling of walking into that part of the map while some epic battle was going on and trying to rush to that side of the room to join is one of my top gaming moments. 

2. Forge of Iron: Loved the rewards, hated the ""matchmaking"". 

3. Menagerie: It's like a Raid without the pressure!

Last week I found out about the multiple player glitch and wanted to try it out and see if it took some of the pressure off me.Thanks to large player activities in the last two weeks, I have:

1. Cleared my first Master Nightfall. Many, many times. It was a blast. 

2. Cleared Deep Stone Crypt for the first time. It was still really nerve wracking though. 

3. Made 9 friends on steam which I didn't have before.

I feel that this whole season has been a slam dunk for me regarding engageability for me. It's such a simple concept: Play the rituals, play battleground, pick your reward, repeat. Whatever your doing Bungie, it's A'ight."

1,"Just bought Sturm, Banshee doesn’t have Drang",See title. Just bought Sturm from the archive but Banshee doesn’t have Drang. Any ideas?
1,"So, I May Be Late Here, But Heritage/Recombination With Trinity Ghoul Is Amazing","The title pretty much says it all. If you have the raid shotgun, Heritage, with the perk recombination, Trinity Ghoul is amazing at proccing that x10 recombination with its elemental kills. Pair with some War Mind cells and you just walk around with a cannon ball loaded in your shotgun, lol. 

Just thought I'd share-- if this is old news, ignore me and I'll be on my merry way. 

Another fun pairing is top tree Dawnblade with Sun Breakers. Run Sun Shot and Wrath of Rasputin. Heritage gets that x10 buff quite often there as well. :)"
1,Help boost pc frames (no guides have helped),"So I have a rog strix laptop  with a gtx 1650 i7 and 12 gigs of ram. I've read several guides and adjusted countless setting but I can't get any consistent frames while playing. At low settings I'm getting 150 frames in orbit, but once I make it planet side I drop to 40s and 50s which drop further to 20s and 30s when I actually start shooting at things. I can't figure out why it's so bad with what I believe to be a good tiered system especially when I see videos of people with the same specs pulling off 60 consistently on ultra settongs.any more direct help would be appreciated and I'll answer any questions I can. Please not I've relatively new to pc gaming, this being my first gaming pc and I've still be most of my gaming on console"
1,"With Transmog coming, unobtained armor that can be viewed in collections should be obtainable","Title.

Let’s say you didn’t get a certain Gambit Prime set that you really like the look of. Gambit Prime is gone but the armor is still sitting there in your collections looking dimmed because you didn’t get it. I think we should be able to get these armor pieces at a higher price of Silver and/or Bright Dust to be able to transmog them and truly take your fashion to the next level."
1,A Rally to Nerf the Wyverns,"Bungie has made plenty of just adjustments this season from stasis tuning to swords, but me and pretty much everyone I know agree that wyverns are extremely over powered.

I feel that their fire rate either needs to be lowered, or the damage per shot needs to be adjusted.

What do you guys think?
Are they over powered or are they okay?
What adjustments would you want Bungie to make to this mob to balance it more?"
1,Bring Trials of the Nine weapons back in some way,"As the title suggests, I think Bungo should bring back the ToTN weapons in some way. I don't care how they do it, through the prophecy dungeon or even by bringing back ToTN itself, but the weapons this gamemode introduced are some of my, and many others, favorite weapons in the game. Relentless is absolutely busted even today (considering its a high impact frame, just like redrix or messenger), a sudden death is still pretty capable in todays sandbox, yada yada, you get the point."
1,Bringing Siberian folk music to the icy wasteland of Europa,"[The Bard is an important part of the party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiRQv6RJKDM)

The emblem is staying on for as long as i play this game"
1,"I’d stay out of gambit for a while, as later challenges have you doing a lot in it again. Spoilers for future challenges.","For the unaware, all of the remaining challenges have been datamined already. I went through the ones we still haven’t seen with some friends of mine to see what we should be planning ahead for.

While some of these may be retroactive, I wouldn’t bet on that.

[SPOILERS. Here’s a spreadsheet with all of the rest of the challenges, thank you to whoever made it!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQDaLp1Dr60e7U040NBzgGsaEmI4OpHnRWLIi2mafqIcXbmYI5TpEPK9tApQKLpmqA6xjMaf5suyx6C/pubhtml)

**Here’s the big gambit problems, for those of you who don’t wanna dig through that:**

Week 8: “Clearing The Inner Circle” Kill 40 Primeval Envoys

Week 9: “Feels Good To Be Bad” Kill 40 guardians in gambit. Bonus progress for kills while invading.

**Additionally here’s some other painful ones:**

* Complete a GM nightfall (week 6)
* Win 7 Rounds of Trials of Osiris (week 7, also gives you a random trials weapon when you complete it)
* Get each of the ornaments for Salvager’s Salvo (weeks 6-8)
* Earn 5 Valor ranks (week 7, matches the gambit one from this week)
* Get 80 guardians with elemental kills in Iron Banner. Bonus progress for stasis kills (week 10)
* Kill 50 combatants in the new strike IN IT’S NIGHTFALL FORM with a linear fusion or a sidearm (week 8)
* Kill 20 boss or elite cabal in the new strike (week 10)
* Kill 400 targets while wearing a matching armor set. Bonus progress on guardian kills. (Week 9)
* Kill 600 targets with grenades or rocket launchers. Bonus progress for multikills. (Week 10)

There’s a few more gross ones but these are the ones that I think most people are gonna complain about.

So, if you’re already putting off doing stuff in crucible, you might as well continue putting it off. Remember that there’s some time after the last week ends, as there’s exactly 28 days between when week 10 starts (April 13th) and when the season ends (May 11th).

Also remember that you can skip some challenges and still get the bright dust at the end. There’s 77 challenges total and you need 75 for the big reward."
1,Make Petra sell weapon frames to let us farm DC gun rolls,"See title, we don't have any way to really farm, we need something similar to the moon weapon frames."
1,We should get a refund for every DLC we own and Bungie is removing,"As the tittle says I'm part of a group of idiots that has bought every DLC on destiny 2 but since ""Vault"" they just took away from us content that we actually payed for, and now they just announced that they're removing Forsaken, seriously? You just don't give a flying F* for the people that has bought your content loyally?

1,Need some answers guardians.,"I played D2 on ps4 I stopped playing around January last year . I have all the DLCs on ps4 except for beyond light . I recently got a PC and wanted to hop back on D2 I know DLCs don't transfer but my weapons etc will.

1,Dredgen Is A Stark Reminder,"I finally got Dredgen.

Not gilded. Just regular Dredgen.

My last triumph needed was Dark Age Arsenal.

It requires a Gambit weapon in every slot.

The new gambit weapons (bottom dollar and cartesian coordinate) don't work for it. (at least, I tried CC once, and it didn't trigger even though we won)

I had to go on a hunt to discover what original gambit weapons were still not sunset.

The answer is, no specials, and just one heavy.

The curated Bad Omens from Drifter, (I dismantled all my other Bad Omens) for heavy, and gnawing hunger, lonesome, and Nightwatch for primaries. also, malfeasance counts, I believe.

Python is sunset.

last man standing is sunset.

Sole Survivor is sunset.

doomsday and just in case: sunset.

literally, every special and heavy I could think of, all sunset.

I'm glad the ""horrors"" of sunsetting are over, but its effects still remain.

I will grieve for my fallen friends. Rest well, dear Python. Tell Cayde I said hello."

My plan would be to find a team in the app at some point when I have time to take it on."
1,Lore Tab Toggle,"Quick request.

Please Bungie, make the Lore Tab ""A"" press a toggle, not a hold.

It's really annoying to want to read the lore, but have to hold the button the whole time.

1,I quit Destiny 2 a couple years ago. Curious to see if any of my issues have been solved or still remain.,"I quit Destiny 2 around Autumn 2019 after playing extensively since launch. I stopped because I had a sort of ""epiphany"" that changed the way I viewed the game and made it so it was no longer fun. I don't know why it took me so long to realise these things but once I did, I couldn't go back. So I'm wondering if Bungie has made any differences over the last few years that would make me want to come back.
My problems:

1. Honestly this is the BIG one. Most of the other things on this list I could ignore or deal with but this was the one that ultimately made the game no longer fun once it clicked for me. The game is just one giant skinner box. You are just forever chasing the new weapons and armour. Finally you get them, then a month later some new content comes out and those weapons and armour you spent so much effort chasing are now irrelevant. Sure, there are often exceptions where something is meta for a long time. But that is often because it is particularly overpowered and to not use it puts you at a disadvantage because everyone else is sure using it. It's not like everyone used them because they're fun to use or whatever. About a year or so after I quit I read about them introducing ""sunsetting"" or something? So instead of MAYBE an item you liked becomes irrelevant, it inevitably became irrelevant? Did I interpret this correctly? Did they reverse this decision? Because it sounds the exact opposite of what I. and I assume others, would like.

2. I thought about putting this in 1 because in order to get those weapons and armour you have to do the same things over and over and over and over again. Now I understand this is some sort of mmofps so brainless grinding kind of comes with the territory, but for me, the best Destiny 2 content was always fun and unique quests. Stuff that had you go to a new area, do new things and showed you cool stuff along the way, not just ""Kill 500 players in crucible"" or ""Complete 200 strikes"".

3. Forcing people to play content they dislike. For basically everything, there would usually be some quest step that involved playing something you didn't particularly enjoy. Be it crucible, strikes, raids, whatever. I understand this, Bungie obviously want people to experience everything rather than segment themselves into factions. But it became extremely frustrating when a meta weapon was locked behind 50 quest steps, all requiring you play a mode you despise. Now, to be fair, around when I stopped playing, they did start having quest steps that let you choose, for example, ""kill 10 players in crucible or complete 2 strikes"" but this was only on a few things. Is this still a thing? Did they expand it to all, or at least more, items?

4. Bungie's disregard and seeming contempt for people without friends. Look, I'm a friendless loser who has many anxiety issues that prevent me from acquiring friends and prevents me from using voice chat. Because of this, a lot of content was literally locked away from me. All raids were out of the question because they were impossible to do without friends or at least voice chat, which isn't an option. Literally everything else in the game doesn't require this. For everything else you can matchmake to get random people to join you and none of it requires voice chat. There are many great examples of games which create content that requires multiple people, but a) provides ways to matchmake and b) provides ways to get around not having voice chat. Look at a game like Journey for an excellent example of this. Look at Apex Legends with it's excellent ping system. This isn't a dig at people who like raids. I'm not asking Bungie not to make them. It just always really sucked for all of this content including weapons and armour to be gatelocked from me, especially when there are so many good examples of games that still has that co-operative element but without needing such a high level of coordination (not sure if that's the right word, hopefully you understand what I mean). It also really sucked because of my next point.

5. Bungie very clearly rewarded raiders a LOT more than everyone else. It's like they think of raiders as their favourite children and everyone else as the runts who occasionally get a few scraps. That's probably a little bit of an exaggeration but every time a new content patch dropped, it would ALWAYS play out like this: new content releases, everyone begins the grind to the new light level cap, for regular people it takes a few months, for raiders it takes a couple weeks. It was so disheartening to see just how damn quickly raiders would take to rank up/level up/whatever the appropriate term is. Raiding just absolutely showers you with powerful engrams. Whereas regular content usually gave you just one. Now, you can make the argument that raiding is more difficult and so deserves higher rewards. Sure. I'm just saying the ratios felt off and that raiders should either get fewer powerful rewards or regular players should get more. It would also be nice if Bungie offered an alternative way to get some of the weapons and armour associated with raids. I'm not saying you shouldn't get unique rewards for doing raids. But some stuff, like exotics, it just felt really unfair to never be able to get and similar to point 3, it would be nice if these could be got in multiple ways.

6. Titans being overpowered in pvp. Probably my most controversial point but I always felt this was the case. They're the only class that always had a one hit melee kill. Turning a corner and seeing a titan running at you was almost always a death sentence and there was absolutely NOTHING you could do about it. How is that fair? They also had easily one of the best grenades, I can't remember what it was called but it was one of the lightning ones that did an aoe pulse. That thing was also often certain death. Oh and titans got the exotic that gives you two grenades. Speaking of exotics, fucking one eyed mask. That thing was the most broken piece of shit I have ever seen in any video game ever. It was actually disgusting. It took Bungie far too long to nerf it and when they did it was still too powerful. I'm sure I'm going to get comments saying hunters had this and warlocks had that so it was fair. Whatever. I'm just saying in my view, it felt like titans were way too strong in pvp.

7. Scout rifles being useless. I really hope this one has changed because it was the easiest to fix. When the game first came out I absolutely loved scout rifles. Especially the MIDA Multi Tool. It was genuinely one of the funnest guns I'd ever used in a game. Perhaps it was a little strong and deserved it's nerf. But what it didn't deserve was to become irrelevant like all scout rifles did. I don't know what they did, what changes to the code they made, but if you played back then you surely remember it. Literally no one used scout rifles because the damage from them was just utterly pathetic. It was just sad. Please tell me they fixed this at least?

This became a lot longer than I intended. Apologies. I guess once I got in a ranty mood and the dam was broken, it all came pouring out. I really would like to get back into the game as I have missed it, but I'd like to know if some of these issues were addressed before I go opening old wounds. I saw an article recently saying they were bringing back permanent shaders and finally introducing transmog. It seems like they're taking good steps. I'm curious to see if these fix some of the issues I had."

Just like that front page post says, gambit truly is ""the most miserable experience I've had playing this game"" and that really is saying something. 

I've done everything I can: I've tried invading BUT after killing multiple high mote players, my team ends up dying with motes or not going fast enough. So I tried collecting motes, yet then my team never invades, or if they do they die immediately. Okay so I tried not collecting motes and just killing things and killing the enemy Invaders the moment they spawn in, but then my team doesn't invade either or just dies to enemy hordes. Idk wtf to do. I'm stuck in legend and I cannot get out no matter how exceptionally I play. WHY IS GAMBIT MADE THIS WAY"

1,Don’t you dare take away forsaken!,"Nuff said, we PAID for it. I can play games with larger file sizes that I bought 10 years ago, time is no excuse. Honestly as much as I love this game I’ll quit in a heartbeat if you take away any more content I paid for(as I’m sure many others would). Bad enough that all the base planets are gone, then there’s mercury and mars. Either give people the option for separate installs or rotate content on a semi regular basis. COD doesn’t care about file size, why do you? If the consumer is ok with it (which we demonstrated by buying it) then it’s sorted. Should France be able to “sunset” the Louisiana purchase?- Does that sound ridiculous because it should. Bought and paid for is bought and paid for."
1,Please fix Champions in lost sectors.,"So for the last couple of hours I been trying to do the lost sector Concealed void on Europa. The drop rate are gut destroyers and the overload and barriers champion seem broken. Overload champion don’t get staggered at all what so ever today their health still regenerates even though it shouldn’t. Using my Code Duello take three shots to kill it at minimum. The boss himself only takes 7. Barriers champions get their barriers broken but teleport out of bounds than regenerate there. Not only that but in the boss fight servitors have a void shield. This makes today’s lost sector need all three elements! Osmosis right now seems to be the only perk I can not get to be on my scout rifles this season. This is only a rant, but I do hope any one who works at Bungie reads this. Until than I can only wait until tomorrow for the update and hope it fixes."

1,Forcing people into a toxic mess for a seasonal triumph and catalyst does not help Crucible,"All I want is a chance at my triumph.  So I’m stuck in Showdown in the most toxic PVP experience in gaming with Trials shut down.  As a solo player, I’ve run into nothing but stacked Trials players.  I’m really not even caring at this point.  If I can get through an entire match with one or two kills with my bow, I’m happy.  If I can screw the fun for the sweats, I’m even happier.  I could care less about objective, just let me get out of here with my 75 Bright Dust.

But this is beyond unpleasant.   And to make it worse, I have to ruin the game for 10 round, meaning 50 other guardians potentially get screwed."

1,Please don't sit on your Super,"I don't know whether to flair this Guide or SGA, but please if you're in the Crucible, **use your Super.** Do not wait for that dream moment when you can get a team wipe.

If you use it once you get it and get even just 1 kill (whether it's 6s or 3s), great, you just won a free team fight, kept your special ammo (and got more) AND you're on your way to your next Super. If you get a team wipe? Even better! But **1 kill is better than none!** This goes for any mode - QP 6s, IB, Comp, Showdown, Trials, anything!

Pretty much every Super in the game can guarantee at least 1 kill (exceptions include Tether and baby blade... I'm sorry but you're probably getting shotgun/meleed in this meta 😭). On Behemoth or Revenant, 2-4 kills is consistently possible.

Contrast that to if you hold it for that special moment towards the end of the match. Say you miss that super when the moment comes. Now you've done absolutely nothing, there's no time for you to get another one. In Comp, this can turn the tide of the entire game. If you're down 0-3, your team just got supers and you start using them to gain momentum, you can get *another set* by the time you're 3-3. Now you've got 2+ free kills in the game.

**TL;DR: Use your Super when you get it! 1 kill &gt; 0 kills!**"
1,Is there a way to find out what scannables I need in the presage mission?,It says on the triumph for the ghost shell I have 3/4 but I do not have the tucked away triumph completed.

1,Can’t grab Presage captain’s logs?,"Let me know if this post doesn’t follow the rules, but I’m at a loss here...

I’ve done Presage numerous times across the weeks, however, I missed a week and now I’m a week behind in terms of collectibles. I’m trying to grab captains logs so I can get the triumph, however, it doesn’t seem like I’m able to grab them now that I’m behind?

I’ve gotten 1 and 2, and read the associated lore, but now that I’m trying to grab the 3rd one, it no longer allows me to grab it on any character or difficulty mode. Am I limited to grabbing the log associated with the current week? Or am I supposed to grab them chronologically? I was able to grab the second one last week but for some reason I can’t grab the third one now. Both pages of lore have been read so I know where the log is, but I can’t interact with it."

1,Bungie the silence about gambit current state is concerning,As someone who is a gambit player I have to say it’s in a really poor state right now. But the fact it wasn’t brought up in the state of game and all the silence from you guys is starting to make me wonder if you are even seeing these post and suggestions to make the game mode better. I know most of community hates gambit but I’m sure they at least want it to succeed.
1,How do you know what weapons drop from certain game modes?,"Like everyone is farming gambit (I think) for the bottom dollar, but how do you know what weapons are more likely to drop in vanguard or crucible?"
1,Variable pricing in eververse?,"Do you guys think we’ll ever get it? 

For those of you who don’t know, variable pricing is when the price of something changes to fit someone’s personal allowance 

Lots of mobile games do this, they’ll collect your data, see how often you buy micro transactions, and if you don’t buy many, they often keep lowering the price until they find your specific sweet spot to open the wallet 

For example (a real one that happened to me) was in clash of clans. I never bought anything in that game, it was a mobile game and I didn’t care at all, until I got a ridiculously good offer of a shit ton of gems and some other stuff for like 3$, I was like fuck it whatever it’s 3$, when for other people it could be 10+

From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense.

Now in destiny, I’ll never spend 15$ on an eververse armor set, it just won’t happen. If Bungie could collect and use this data (which they probably have) they’d see that, and sell me a personal limited time offer of the eververse sets being 1/3 off at 10$, okay now maybe I’ll snag one. Get it? 

This allows Bungie to get every player to spend the maximum amount the player is willing to spend on the item. Instead of a blanket 15$ that everyone needs to spend, keep it 15$ for the whales who will always buy it, and individually lower it for people who never do. they’d make more money, and we’d get better deals and Ornaments. Bungie is making 0 dollars off me right now for armor sets, if they individually lowered mine at 10$, they might get me to grab 2 sets. Now multiply that by everybody who also doesn’t buy much

The biggest complaint I see with this is an ethical one however"

1,Raids and new players in General,"Hello there,

So i am a fairly new player to destiny 2. I played a lot of destiny 1 and enjoyed and now destiny 2 resparked this passion.

However i am really starting to get annoyed by this community. When in destiny 1 someone didnt know a raid oder how to play a nightfall correctly you would just help him and take your time and enjoy the game.

But now i want to play the deep stone crypt and cant because i only played it 2 or 3 times and still dont really now the path in the beginning with the blizzard  and how to play scanner or operator. However i knew the rest.

But when i want to play with people who only want people that KWTD i get kicked out since i dont know neither operator nor the scanner and i dont have the perfect pve weapons and just do 1 million damage to taniks in the first round instead of 1.5. 

Then i told myself well then lets play with people who drag new players through the raid and learn a bit more but i also cant do that since they see i already have it cleared three times and kick me out. 

This happened 5 times today that i got kicked out and will not be able to play the raid this week.

Please people just have more fun with the game and tryhard so insanely. Just enjoy the game and let casual players like me and a lot of other player play the game."
1,"Following a tight Survival loss I messaged the opposite player ""GG"" to which they replied with details on how I could purchase their Recov services for trials and comp - Bungie this should really be against the ToS.","I'm sitting around 5.2k GR, havnt hit Legend this season and I was on a bit of a run this afternoon when it was abruptly halted by one very highly skilled guardian.   
  
Usually if I come across someone who plays well against me I like to send them a ""GG"" message, which I did. A moment later I got a response advertising their recov service for trials and survival. It left a very bitter taste in my mouth, I may have gone onto get legend if it wasn't for someone buying a recov and that recov blocking my progress.   
  
Amazingly I see that recovs are not a banable offence in the ToS, even though they affect normal players. 

  
Not sure if I am alone in thinking this, but trials and a lesser extent survival would be in a healthier place if it wasn't for paid recov services. 

  
Trials was switched off twice due to the hakke exploit, but the people doing this didn't hurt anyone. Feels bad man."

1,Can warlocks get some more love?,"While I main hunter for the most part in d2, in d1 and when I play d2 on console I play a fair bit of warlock (mainly top tree dawn and nova warp). If you look at pvp there are barely any viable subclasses to choose from and I feel like they need a bit of help. Maybe try buffing some of the subclasses or add more exotics that vastly improves gameplay for them (like mask of bakris, wormhusk, stompees, or frostees). I just want to be able to have viable subclasses for warlocks in pvp and not have to choose fun over winning. Nova warp was honestly one of my favorite destiny subclasses of all time when it came out, and I still love the gameplay loop. But I really think bungie needs to give em a leg up. Maybe add a really good aspect (on the level of shatterdive or Titan super slide) that vastly improved stasis warlock. I’m not a game dev but I never feel powerful when I’m not on top tree dawn compared to Titan or hunter counterparts."

1,I just “redownload” destiny after after 7 years of not playing it,"Alright so here’s the story, it’s September 9 2014, I’m a college senior who’s loved by bungie since I played halo 2, I just got my paycheck from subway and I decided to treat myself to the newest bungie game, destiny, a large open world adventure that’s Guaranteed to blow your mind, so I go to my local game shop to pick up and I get the last copy on the shelf, I go home and put it in my PS4, I see that the download would take a while so I put it on rest more and start doing other things, meanwhile my father, a former cancer patient, has told me that his cancer is flaring up again, I always had a strong relationship with my father and when he got cancer I was with him the whole time and I was willing to do it again, unfortunately he lived in Indiana, and I lived in Florida, when I got the text I dropped everything, packed for a 2 week long trip and I immediately bought a ticket, when I arrived I stayed by my father and mother’s side until my fathers cancer calmed town, I stayed at the city my mom and dad resided and I really enjoyed it, I eventually came back to my house in south Florida after everything seemed to calm down, when I had come back however it wasn’t time for games and happiness, I had left in a big hurry with a ton of things undecided, first I had my job which I actually able to get back into my job with little or no hassle  (my brother was the manager) after that there was bills to pay, people to meet, and just overall things to do, I eventually got back to my PS4 but I never got on destiny, I had bought uncharted the Nathan drake collection when I was in Indiana and I was eager to play it after playing uncharted 1 and 2 on the ps3. I eventually deleted the game in 2016 Becuase I was selling my first gen PS4 for a new PS4 pro, fast forward a couple years, multiple girlfriends, a lot of jobs and a new house and here we are, a week ago I found the dusty old copy of destiny along with a couple of other games, I put the disk in and waited for it to download, it gave me plenty of enough time to reflect on how I got here and how much it’s been since since I first put the game in, I felt like I was one of the first people to play it, yet I didn’t even start the game, and here we are today a week later with asking you guys what should I expect, I know the game has drastically changed since 2014 so I want to know anything and everything new about it. Thanks a lot for reading through this. I appreciate the support"

1,Wish ender/key of light and darkness,"So I’m sure this has been brought up before but I can’t find any RECENT discussions on it so here goes. 

I’ve been playing D2 Since launch but have a bad habit of not finishing things until much later. I played through forsaken back in 2018 and unlocked Dreaming City but never got wish ender done. 

A few weeks before Beyond Light released I did the ??? Mission and received the 3 tokens but didn’t feel like running shattered throne at the time. Now, finally, last night I did shattered throne and the 3 bosses and claimed the bow. However, my OCD is acting up as I have a quest for Wish Ender (present this to statue) stuck in my quests tab. I also have a quest Key of Light and Darkness that I’m not sure I need to complete. Any idea if I should just abandon them? Why wouldn’t they be removed if there’s no reason to complete them as 

A) I already have the bow 
B) I’ve already unlocked the dreaming city

1,A Quick word about the Icefall Mantle,"I love using Icefall Mantle, fun exotic that keeps me in the fray of the fight, but Bungie, please allow users to use the class ability key/button to manually toggle the effect off if they so choose. 

There have been quite a few occasions where I use the ability in the midst of combat, then the room gets wiped, but since every time you receive damage while the effect is active, it resets the time to 20 seconds, AND you cannot sprint or jump while the effect is active (which is fine), I'm stuck walking my slow self over to the next room while my Fireteam members are blazing through the level. It would just be a really nice QoL change to be able to toggle the effect off with another press of the ability key/button. Hopefully other Guardians agree."
1,It blows my mind that so many people don't know about todayindestiny.com,This is an incredible resource. I mostly use it to look up upcoming EV items but it's so much more than that.

County board makes it easy for you to really focus your play session on what types of activities you want to do.

I like the three core weapons in gambit, yet I can’t land a usable roll of the Bottom Dollar, the vanguard Rocket Launcher has amazing combinations, only one drop after weeks of grinding strikes and nightfalls. I don’t mind grinding one bounty on all three characters once a week, rather do that than battlegrounds missions..."
1,Change “combatants” to “enemies of humanity” in perk descriptions,"Bungie uses the term **combatants** in newer item descriptions whenever an item’s perk relates to PVE enemies. However, this term isn’t 100% consistent (as YouTubers such as Fallout Plays have shown in some videos). Sometimes it also works in PVP. It's a term that's too broad and unclear given the many different game modes in *Destiny*.

However, while playing (a lot of) Gambit this past week, I noticed the term used on the loading screen: **enemies of humanity**. This is great and it's a solution that already exists.

For PVP-only perks, what if the perk stated “**against enemy Guardians**” or ""**in the Crucible**""?

And for perks that work across PVP/PVE, how about “**against any enemy**”?

This would clarify some perk descriptions. I mention this because a recent TWAB said some in-game text would be corrected for grammar, and this could be a good change for user experience.

(The D1 term “minions of Darkness” was discontinued in D2. And “PVE/PVP” are jargony terms that understandably aren’t used in-game.)"
1,Prismatic Recaster is a waste of time!,"I just can't do it anymore.  I was excited to try to farm a good SMG after unlocking the Tier 3 SMG/Sidearm Umbral.  That was until I unlocked 5 straight Brass Attacks, none of which equal the rolls I have gotten from just playing the game.  Honestly, it is too much work.  Not that BA is a bad gun...it's just where's the variety here?  There are a couple of different weapons that can roll and I get the same one 5 straight times?  SMH

I told myself if I didn't roll anything different on my 5th try, I was done grinding battlegrounds...so I am done playing that mode until the new season...so that's a plus."
1,Adept Weapons from Trials/GM NFs should roll with 2 perks in the final perk column.,"After going Flawless 3x in Trials this weekend just to get 3 badly rolled Messenger's, especially none with Desperado, feels bad.

Putting in **that** much work, just to have a slim chance at the roll you want, feels really bad. There needs to be a differentiator to non-Adept weapons, aside from Adept mods that don't really add much to the weapon IMO. Getting the roll you want should be a little easier and the gun should offer more flexibility with the additional perk slots.

The ones I have so far just feel like a status symbol with marginally better stats, featuring a mod that hurts as much as it helps. 

Additionally, there are other versions of these perks that work all the time. This could be why I have never met someone that is actually happy to get either of these on their weapon."

We were both jokingly said “that’s a free bottom dollar.” Little did we know he had just gotten the best bottom dollar I have ever seen in my life. It has rampage, killing wind, and a range masterwork. Is this the best?"
1,I've also made a C#/.NET wrapper for the Bungie.net API,"It's called ""BungieSharper"" (since BungieSharp was already taken by a wrapper that hasn't been updated since 2016) and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/ashakoor/BungieSharper) and get it on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BungieSharper) or one of the other places listed in the wiki section of the repo [here.](https://github.com/ashakoor/BungieSharper/wiki#getting-started)

I started working on BungieSharper around 2.5 years ago, when I had basically no programming experience, and anything I learned at the time was a direct result of working on it. At the time, it was called ""NetBungieApi"" (not to be confused with "".NetBungieAPI"" posted on the sub by EndGameGl a couple days ago) and I worked on it for about 3-4 months before abandoning all my Destiny-related projects. Came back to it about 9 months ago, renamed it to what it is now, and made a ton of changes to make it publicly usable.

Features:

- Fully asynchronous (where possible) and makes use of `CancellationTokens`
- Uses `System.Net.HttpClient` and `System.Text.Json` so there are 0 dependencies for .NET 5.0, and just `System.Text.Json` v5.0+ for .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Core 3.1.
  - No support for anything earlier, as I make use of nullable reference types from C# 8.0 and don't want to include a billion preprocessor directives to support older versions. And .NET Core 3.0 is EOL, so nobody should use it.
- Built-in rate limiter to keep yourself from hitting the Bungie API too much (officially stated limit is 250requests/10seconds/IP)
- All the Bungie API-specific code is generated by ""BungieSharper.CodeGen"" using the `openapi.json` specification in [their GitHub repo,](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/) so any changes to the API will be trivial to make to BungieSharper.
- Feature-complete (in terms of accessing the API.) `POST` requests are implemented, though I haven't checked them, as I don't have a purpose for them at the moment. `GET` requests and OAuth for ""confidential"" clients are working perfectly for me though.
- Includes all the official documentation in the docstrings, so you get to read about all the ordeals the API team had to go through. And I guess there's also some stuff about using the API in there.

There's some other stuff as well which you can find in the wiki, as this post is getting long enough. I'm open to feedback, questions, concerns, comments, pull requests, issues, etc.

1,Recently returned to Destiny.....whats the current Meta?,"I'd love some details on on what the current meta is for PVE, PVP and Titan Subclasses.   
I know this is the sort of post that gets downvoted into oblivion, but id love to talk weapons and subclasses with some fellow guardians and you guys are the only people i know! 

Thanks guys"
1,"Returning player, tips on getting re-started?","So I haven’t played Destiny 2 since Forsaken’s launch in 2018. I cross saved my PSN account to Steam, however I’m really confused on what I can and should be doing with all the changes done over my absence. I remember this community being absolutely wonderful though, so I’m hoping a couple Guardians can point me in the right direction. Thank you!
(P.S: I have not purchased any of the current expansions on PC yet, I want to see if I can have faith in the game again before I throw $80 or so dollars at it)"
1,Anyone else having more CTD with verify integrity of cache errors while in tower more often?,[removed]
1,Bashee is selling ICARUS GRIP!! Buy before it’s gone!,Great mod for shooting in the air
1,What's a good heavy weapon to pair with Trinity Ghoul and shotgun?,"I'm enjoying having TG for clear and a slug shotgun for majors, but I feel like I will have trouble against bosses that I cant close to. I thought the Temptation's Hook might be fun but I'm reading that it might not be the best. I haven't played in a while so a little bit unsure on the state of PVE loadouts."
1,What Is Your Favorite (Destiny) Gaming Memory?🤔,"For me personally I would say around half of my **(current)** Xbox friends list came from doing raids back in the **D1** days. All the hours upon hours of grind **(across all three characters)** for weapons like Suros Regime, Gjallarhorn, Atheon's Epilogue etc.

So it's probably making friends and grinding for me... **well that and cheesing all the raids that was kind of fun too.**"
1,"Just realized: At the end of Season of the Chosen, we will be exactly halfway through the life and saga of Destiny 2.","Since there's a seventh expansion that's been confirmed, there will be 7 years of Destiny 2. We have completed years 1-3 and will be halfway through Y4 in just a few short months. We still have years 5, 6, and 7 to go, and even after that it won't be the end of Destiny itself, just the Light and Darkness saga. After that, that's probably when we get D3."
1,12 man raids/nightfalls/dungeons were definitely a “you had to be there” moment. We need a special emblem for remembrance.,"If we can have a special emblem for laser tag weekend and lord of wolves, then I don’t see why we can’t have a special emblem for one of the funnest things to happen in the game for a while."
1,Linear fusion rifles,"Let lfr fire a laser for like a second like a trace rifle and let us aim the beam like on fusion rifles. Since they pierce their targets they would be much better at ad clearing, cause you would be able to annihilate all ads in a general direction, instead of relying on rng that all the ads line up perfectly. This would differentiate them from fusions, since fusions fire projectiles that are stuck on the first thing they hit and lfr wouldn't be practically worse sniper rifles because you would get more bang for your buck. On bosses you could rearrange them to do only one crit per entity, but if you are wailing around a boss you could still hit it multiple times, let's just say 3 times, one of the hits could be a crit, the other two would be normal hits. This would make them better at boss damage, but not overpowered if tuned correctly, but more importantly, it would give them some identity.

side note: even having them being intrinsic anti barrier would make them a lot better in pve and would fit in the laser beam theme.

Not talking about pvp at all, they can tune things differently from pve."
1,What DLC is necessary for a new player in 2021?,"Hey guys. As the title implies, I'm trying to decipher what DLC I actually need to/should buy. Now I'm not a new player; I have quite a few hours in the game across the last two years. However, I've never done a raid or done a ton of endgame content and I've never purchased any DLC for the game.

Now I anticipated that just buying everything would be the best bet. However, doing just a little research made me realize that a lot of content has been basically phased out. This makes it pretty difficult for a casual player to understand just what the hell I should buy.

Is there any easy guide for what DLC is still worth buying at the start of 2021?"
1,Last Wish Mods in Dungeons?,"Do the Taken mods work in profecy dungeon?  See posts about using them, but they say they are only active in the Last Wish Raid.

So that begs the other question.  Do any of the other raid mods work in normal activities?   Nightfalls, etc?"
1,Stasis has completly ruined PvP for me,"It used to be fun when the most broken thing was handheld because most people were not using it, but now i can be  walking around a corner and get imdeialt frozen and then one shot, it's just not fun. AND THAT BREKING OUT OF STASIS DEALS DAMEGE TO YOU is one of the dumbest things i have ever seen i dont think i could come up with something more stupid if i tried, imagine if a flashbang in CSGO ethier lasted for twice the duration or did half your health, and glacial quake or behemot titan or what ever its called is so unbelivebly OP like they have infinte resitence and can freez in a massive area and are also super mobile, with how stong Stasis is, PvP has basicaly become pay to win.

&amp;#x200B;

 Its just vent dont get too mad"
1,Bungie i should not be getting absolutely 0 infamy with a loss at legend,"Like ffs its already hard enough getting to legend plus in order to reset you have to get 3000 infamy through just wins and bounties, and as a solo player consistently going up against 3 - 4 stacks is just a absolute pain.

TLDR (pointless ik): bungo either give us infamy for a loss at legend or give us freelance gambit

Oh and btw almost 0 bottom dollars (not that i like 140s anyway)"
1,Essence of pride Bug?,"So I went to the moon to get a full dreambane set and the game says I have an essence of pride, and that I can’t hold more than one, but none of my guardians are carrying an essence of pride? What’s going on"
1,Rat King + Omnioculus Nerf?,"Been seeing a few people mention this upcoming nerf, makes me sad because I've just started playing with this build and it's a ton of fun, but I guess I get it, it does seem like an unintended interaction.

1,With The New Stasis Subclasses You Should Be Able to Get 3 Even 4 100 Stats,"I was pondering this the other day as I just got 100 Recovery and Discipline on my Warlock so I started doing the math. 

Say you have 4 60 stat total pieces of amor each can have a mod and be masterworked. This equals 82 times 4 for 328 or 3 tier 100s with great rng, then 328+22 for class item giving 350, then 350+50 for amor mods. 400+40 for powerful friends and radiant light then plus 30 for stasis aspects. This is 470, but the chance of having this collectively in 4 stats is crazy low. And even if you did do it you would be limited to the class stats(Mobility,Recovery, and Resilience) and Melee

You could however have 3 100 stats with more variety; 
One would have to be melee 
One would have to be Recovery, Resilience, or Mobility
The last could be any stat not already chosen
Here is the math for it in a more laid out way for an example of 3 stats.


Melee: 60+MW=72+20(Radiant Light)=92+10(Stasis)=102

Recovery: 60+MW=72+10(Stasis)=82+20(Normal Stat Mods)=102

Intellect: 60+MW=72+30(Normal Stat Mods)=102

For those who are curious this is how you could do 4 100 stats(like the example given above) however this would need extremely good rng for the base stats and sadly you are forced to use Melee and the Class stats

Mobility: 60+MW=72+20(Powerful Friends)=92+10(Normal Stat Mod)=100

Recovery: 60+MW=72+10(Stasis)=82+20(Normal Stat Mods)=102

Resilience: 60+MW=72+10(Stasis)=82+20(Normal Stat Mods)=102

Melee: 60+MW=72+20(Radiant Light)=92+10(Stasis)=102

Now I’m sure some of you are saying there’s no way to get 60 in 4 stats without mods, but it’s definitely possible, all you need is at least 15 in those 4 stats with little amounts like 2 or 4 in the others. This is of course is vary to chance as one piece might have 12 and another 18. Amor with those rolls can drop however it’s very rare and is why 4 100 is barely possible. 
However it is definitely possible and I would guarantee that at least one person has the amor to pull this off"

1,Some upcoming seasons should revolve around a faction as the seasonal vendor.,"Since Bungie has removed faction gear from the game, largely, as we move to seasonal gear and activities, it would be cool if there was a year where each of those vendors become the seasonal vendor for an activity.

1,Warlock shattering Fragments: quick concepts to let the floof lads &amp; lasses get shattering like the slide apes and dunk Bs,"As many know, Warlocks don't anything alike the slide to shatter or a dunk to shatter, **in terms of shatter, we have no shatter**, they have no stasis shattering capacities beyond their super, they have a no good turret and a ""rift-to-freeze"" that was good with Vesper of Radius for all 2 hours before it was nerfed. But I have a few ideas to make this change for Warlocks. 

1. I would give warlocks a second granade ability, that, when they have one fully charged granade would make the charge rate of the second say half the time, and when there are frozen enemies/stasis cristales nearby, they eat their granade and shatter nearby crystals.

2. Else we could have Double nades but after freezing an enemy the second granade becomes a special shattering granade, though this idea is unfair to other classes because they have to get close to the crystals to shatter them, Warlocks wouldn't have to be close and would make other classes feel like warlocks can play from afar while they need to get up close and personal and that will just land us with another nerf.

3. Other idea I have is just a basic blink, with the caveat that you can only blink (using mobility ability key, same as Icarus and Dive) into a crystal/frozem enemy if you're looking at it (maybe give it a HUD highlight). Blinking will cause shattering of the crystal from the inside, the enemies' tell for Warlocks to do this would be the red marker that stasis give to frozen combatants. If the enemy does not die, the blink will add certain momentum that may or may not thrust them into a wall to their doom. Cooldown is the same as Shatterdive. Note that warlocks won't be able to blink around without crystals around so it won't be something the player can cast on demand like a slide or Shatterdive or Slide, but it has the benefit of providing instantaneous movement and safety from enemy fire for panic uses of a glacial nade and blinking into it. Also if they can do this while in super is up to Bungie devs/sandbox balance team, though I'd let it happen at the beginning and change it afterwards.

4. If none of these sound good, just buff again Vesper of Radius and let us shatter with that.

I wouldn't try to pick names for these, they are up to Bungie as I don't feel I can pick names since Aspects are things that seemingly could be found in the world like a fallen arm, a frozen Cabal turret, a frozen Vex  Conflux but with whacky names. I would however dare to suggest the items, for the grandes it could be a frozen fallen granade and for the blink one a frozen Vex head."
1,Warmind Cell Guide,"Fallout Plays did a really clear and comprehensive guide to Warmind Cells a few weeks ago.  With Rage of Rasputin having finally shown up, it's worth understanding the exact mechanics.

[https://youtu.be/OTVJhlHxa8w?t=163](https://youtu.be/OTVJhlHxa8w?t=163)

&amp;#x200B;

Some key points:

* The effect when YOU shoot a warmind cell depends on the mods YOU have equipped.  If YOU don't have warmind mods, **do not shoot warmind cells**.
* Warmind cells spawn every 5 'eligible kills'.  Eligible kills are 1) killing blows with a Seventh Seraph/Ikelos weapon, 2) killing blows from another weapon (witherhoard, telesto) if you have your Seventh Sereph/Ikelos weapon equipped at the time the target dies, or 3) killing blows from solar splash damage, if you have Wrath of Rasputin mod slotted
* Rage + Wrath + Global Reach = big badda boom"

1,Mantle of Battle Harmony Vs Phoenix Protocol for GM?,"GM are starting tomorrow and I was wondering if you guys think the old strat of using Phoenix Protocol is better or should I switch to Mantle for the extra damage?

I think Mantle + ticcu + warmind has potential in GMs. Also, with the new elemental well mods, getting super might be easy."
1,I'm really glad Bungie delt with season pass FOMO and xp grind.,The way bungie has don't the weekly challenges or bounties or whatever you want to call them is a great thing. Giving large chunks of xp is great. I'm already past level 100. This is the fastest I've ever done that. For reference I play about 9 hrs a week. This enables me to focus on my two other characters more and get better armor for them since I don't really ever play them. Also I'm about to become a first time dad in 5 months so the reduction in power grind and xp grind is perfect.
1,"What isbthe best way to grind out gear and ""level"" up in D2?","I've been doing strikes, and I've been wondering if there's anything more efficient to get better loot, engrams, and such."
1,Cohesion problems with stats and nomenclature,"Destiny seems to have big issues with sticking to a nomenclature for buffs/debuffs/triggers/stats. It is very frustrating to have ""combatants"" mean PvE only on one item, PvP AND PvE on another. Especially when the definition changes without patch notes, see Surprise Attack that used to be a 100% buff in PvE only, was suddenly turned into a 35% damage buff that works both in PvE and PvP with no indication or text change.

Range means a lot of different things depending on the weapon, it used to reduce spread on shotguns, now it doesn't, precision frame shotguns have a vastly higher range stat compared to aggressive but don't have any longer effective range in practise, some weapons have capped range some doesn't etc.

For as simple as Destiny is compared to a lot of ARPG/Looter shooter games in terms of available modifiers/stats it is also one of the most opaque and full of absolute nonsense descriptions.

It would be really nice to see this being tackled in the future, someone at Bungie needs to sit down and have a look at all the text. What is Combatant supposed to mean, why was ""takedown"" introduced instead of using kill, what exactly is the definition of minor/major/boss. (champions seems to sometimes be bosses, sometimes majors for the weapon mod damage) etc."
1,Dismantling spoils,I’m stuck at 239 spoils and can’t pick more up to get to the cap so I can get a raid exotic. What am I meant to do?
1,Can we stream in fullscreen? And I’m also having problems with input latency when OUT of fullscreen.,"When trying to stream D2 through either OBS or Discord, fullscreen D2 just gives a black screen. So I swap off of fullscreen and that solves that problem; unfortunately, when on anything other than fullscreen, I get input lag (for both MnK and controller). Perhaps I’m just completely overlooking something, but the input latency is bad to the point to where I wouldn’t wanna play crucible with it.
Any ideas/advice?"
1,GIVE ME COMPETITIVE GAMBIT,"I WANT SBMM COMPETITIVE GAMBIT, with ornament rewards like the crucible armour ornaments or the trials ornaments from CoO and Warmind. I WOULD LOVE THAT! Maybe an infamy bonus for playing in the playlist and an increased drop chance of the gambit weapons. This will also create somewhere for gambit sweats, it would be great"
1,Played a bit of Gambit this week,"Sweated the entire week to get the five rank up which made me have to reset my Infamy and I got no Bottom Dollar

1,"What if we, by stepping into battlegrounds for whatever reasons, we are technically competing for the war council?","Caiatl is smart. She knows a show of inferiority would undermine her power amongst the Cabal. She knew Zavala would say no to demand to bow. But she needed a way to get Guardians on board.

(Also, this is another reason why I really don’t think she was behind the assassination attempt. It has to be someone who does not want to see the Cabal and the Guardians ally)"
1,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but if Witch Queen is delayed until 2022, shouldn’t Bungie extend seasons 13-15 by a month or so?","Remember when Beyond Light was delayed until November, and by the time it released, everyone was just kinda bored with Season of Arrivals since they had to spread out the last months worth of content over 3 months? Well, with Witch Queen being delayed until early 2022 (which at the earliest is January), I can only imagine how people are gonna feel if they just extend season 15 by **at least** 4 months. It would help mitigate the end-of-the-year burnout by spreading out the extensions across 3 seasons."
1,Current state of the game.,"AS someone who has played since day 1 Destiny 1, and who hasn't played D2 in about 4 months. I'm curious as to most people's honest opinion surrounding the current state of the game, both PvE and PvP.

1,Spent 6 hours on Garden Of Salvation raid for Divinity,"Got kicked out half way through the raid (we had to restart because the game broke) they said “cyn I’m gonna be honest with you, you are putting us back in the raid” I just said sorry and I’ll leave. Almost teared up. Kind of a vent post sorry."
1,Forget whether you think win trading is a problem or not. This weekend showed me something I never really considered,"So, hate me if you want, but my team who I run Trials with decided to go the Hakker method due to a variety of reasons, but that doesn't really matter. While we were going through it, adding other Guardians, rolling, and shooting the shit while they/we change characters, we were legitimately having fun and it dawned upon me. Social interaction in-game is pretty much nonexistent .

The only times I really interact with fellow Guardians is through third parties like the various Destiny subreddits or LFG. Majority of the time I've sought out teams to raid with and so on, I've honestly had a blast, but now that my friends have all gotten back into the game recently, I've gone back into almost zero interaction mode with the community save for the random times that a big chonky Titan decides to come give me a hug in the Tower.

This so called ""MMO"" really needs some systems in place that encourages and enables some real interaction with other Guardians. Be it an in game LFG system, maybe trading if they could somehow figure that out and balance it, or perhaps some large scale activities where there is a big group of Guardians at your back. I don't know, while we all exist and run around in the same instances, the same worlds, having played other MMOs, this is the only one that feels like it isolates me from everyone else"
1,Bungie said in TWAB a couple of weeks back that they will adjust drop rates for things like Bottom Dollar this season. When is that happening?,[removed]
1,"No, 12-man raids shouldn't be permenant feature.","There, I said it. It shouldn't be a permenant feature, because it would ruin the reason why we raid, the challenge. Raids are fun, because they are challenging, taking the challenge away and it's not fun. Also if the game added 12-man raids, Bungie would need to design raids around that number of players while also designing it around 6-man teams, it would be a complete design failure and it would take forever for a new raid to come out!"
1,New Player: Inability to get certain mods make me sad :(,"It's just very depressing to be a newish player and look at all these videos about cool builds and then find out that you don't have the mods and don't have a way to get them. I started late November 2020 and have about 500 hours by now, and I've got most things I need to be successful, but I'll forever be behind my teammates on Atrax damage because Banshee won't sell Lucent Blade. I also really want Protective Light and Powerful Friends, but alas. I've been checking the mods sales daily since January when I first understood the problem, and I finally have all the normal, non-combat-style mods (I didn't get auto rifle reserves until the very end which was annoying when trying to run Divinity for Taniks), and I thought that maybe turning in gunsmith mats would start getting me random combat style mods, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Anyways Bungie, I feel like you've done a decent job at making new players not feel left out, but this one kind of stings because of the impossibility. I'm about to be away from my computer for a few weeks, and I'm terrified that one of the ones I need will be on offer and I'll miss my chance for the next year. I'm probably going to resort to giving my login info to someone else which is not a great solution but it's all I got -\_-

tl;dr I'd love to be able to grind literally any activity for just a chance at more mods until I have them all"
1,Uldren All Along (Art),"After listening to a certain, [super catchy song from Wandavision](https://youtu.be/P8u8md-NiHM) for the billionth time I had this silly idea inspired by the latest in game stuff involving Crow.  Just a quick doodle with some digital enhancements.  *Spoiler tag used to protect the innocent, or something.*

Thanks for looking!"
1,Should I reset my infamy in hopes of Bungie adding the weapons to the engrams?,"I don’t know how, but I went from Legend all the way back to Legend this week and I’m not sure if I should reset just in case they add the weapons to Drifter. I have all the engrams to be collected but idk."
1,Could we get drop percentages in the collections tab not just the location of the drop,"For example, the Trials sparrow says there's a chance of this dropping at the flawless chest.... what chance specifically?

I'm asking this as I'm chasing the the ship, The Fourth Mark, from the Coup De Grace mission. Must have done this over 100 times since release.... still nothing! 

Does anyone know if items like this have the same drop pattern as the Eyes of Tomorrow (increases the chance of the drop after each completion). Thanks."
1,DCV is Good and Bad,"It always amazes me how upset people get over this DCV thing. Bungie has placed content into it exactly ONE time, yet everyone seems to be really mad and acting like they removed content multiple times. The majority of the content placed in there I, and I would even say most, barely touched or played it. Sure there are exceptions, but I think it's much healthier for them and Bungie's employees to work this way. This allows them to focus on bring bigger and better new content. Instead of always needed to balance and test older content.  

If we get more content similar to how this current season is current going, I'm all for them placing older content in the DCV and continuing to evolve the story and setting. 

Also, think about how much time you have invested in Destiny over the years. For \~40$ a year, plus 10$ seasons if you want,  most players have logged dozens and hundreds of hours each year. I really can only think of a handful of games that I keep going back to each year. Most I spend the 60$ and beat it. Maybe play some extra side stuff, but really never go back to it. The DCV is, in a way, a similar concept. You play the new content a bunch, then years later never really touch it anymore because you have moved on to the new content. EA makes people  pay 60$ each year for the same sports game with just new name and stats on players. 

Maybe I'm in the minority, but I am perfectly fine with content going into the DCV after a couple of years. For \~40$ a year, Destiny really is not that much money. Plus, if you don't enjoy it anymore, there are millions of other games to play. Destiny will always be here with new content if you want to come back. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Remember, D2 basically was Bungie placing D1 in the DCV after three years. But I don't remember people complaining about that one. Sure you can technically go back and play everything, but how many people REALLY touched D1 after D2 released?"
1,My ideas to help fix Gambit.,"These probably aren't that great but it's just some of things my clan has been discussing after chasing the In it for Infamy challenge.

1. No invasions when your team is leading by 20 motes. One of the most common steamrolling tactics is  a bunch of large blockers and then immediate invasion. This makes it so that the enemy team is unable to bank, and has to deal with an invader before they can even get their feet wet. Nothing feels worse than a prime up with less than 20 motes on your side. 

2. No melt bosses. Immune phases aren't that fun, but Gambit primes way of doing DPS felt way more rewarding and actually had time in between DPS to effectively invade. There are too many matches where the enemy team is absolutely melting their prime before a teammate can even get a clear shot on them after invading.

2.5. The servitor boss is a slap in the face to those for and against immune phases. The boss is terrible. It's the only one with a mechanic and because of that I'd prefer the others way more. I do not enjoy readying a slova and firing just for a teammate to hit it once with a Handcannon and a knock off taken goblin to appear.

3. More maps. Bring back the old, and in with some new. I would not hate getting absolutely destroyed if I could be destroyed on Europa, the Moon, the Cosmodrome, Io, Mercury(both possible because of Deep Six and New Arcadia).

4. Better ammo distribution. No more heavy ammo wall things. Invaders have a 100% chance to spawn heavy and special when killed. Small blockers have a 50% chance to spawn special. Mediums have a 90% of special and a 30% chance of heavy. Large have a 100% special and 60% heavy. This will further encourage teammates to take out blockers for a chance of some heavy or special, and kill Invaders to help their teammates with added reward of getting some heavy and special.

5. Invaders should need to deal the killing blow. If a invader so much as touches me dealing 1 damage and then I get killed by enemies before regenerating that counts as an invader kill and heals the prime. 

6. Weekly/Daily Modifiers. This is just a fun one to add more variety. Maybe have stuff like grenadier, brawler, and arc singe appear. 

7. Reissue the Gambit(excluding Trust, Bygones and Bad Omens, but update their power cap)(and maybe prime) weapons to drop from matches with perk pools that have as Trinary System and Bottom dollar. You have a 100% chance of getting a Gambit weapon per game, and can get a maximum of 3 per match. 

7.5 Gamblers Umbral. Umbral engram that has all available Gambit weapons in it. Has 6 similar engrams.

Row2:

Gambler's Energy: Trinary System, Bottom Dollar, Distant Relation, and Crowd Pleaser.

Gambler's Kinetic: Dreaded Venture, Parcel of Stardust, Hazard of the Cast, Pillager.

Row3:

Gambler's Precison: Dreaded Venture, Distant Relation

Gambler's Chosen: Bottom Dollar, Trinary System.

Gambler's Abuse: Pillager, Crowd Pleaser

Gambler's Knockout: Parcel of Stardust, Hazard of the Cast.

Gambit matches now grant Risky Token. Risky Tokens work similar to Hammer Charges. Row1 requires 1 Token. Row2 requires 3 just kidding that would be insane😐. Row2 requires 2. And Row 3 requires 3. Winning a Gambit match grants 2-3. Losing grants 0-1. I don't want to have a Gambit loss grant 0, but many people in this game are getting rewarded to disadvantaging their teammates by throwing. The 0-1 amount let's those who loss a chance at a Token, and Lazy people a chance at nothing. Drifter also sells upgrades that cost 5-15 Risky Tokens. Stuff like Gambit Matches have a higher chance to drop Umbrals, or can drop a random Gambit Umbral engram.

These are all probably very bad, and a lot of people will tell me that, but I wanted to share some things I have talked about with my clan that might help improve Gambit.


TL;DR: Gambit?

Also how do you make stuff bold and big on mobile."
1,Adept weapons have so much wasted potential right now. Here is how to make them appealing,"Im taking the shadow price as an example, but really you can use the same arguments for any adept weapon.

Adept weapons are (or should be) hard to earn via endgame content like trials of Osiris, GM nightfalls or master raids in the future.

So because of that i feel like they should standout way more than their non adept counterparts.

First of all they should roll entirely different perks than the normal versions and second Bottomless Grief and Celerity should be made intrinsic on adept weapons. Also instead of barrel options id love to have them come with scopes instead

I feel like the old pinnacle weapons did a great job of introducing new interesting perks, but i also think that it was a mistake of not just making them pinnacle perks. 

So imagine the adept shadow price could roll with onslaught (Breakneck perk) and Meganeura (oxygen sr perk) or maybe even despacito. 

This would be a weapon i would want to grind a godroll for. It really would be a incentive to get into the endgame.

But as of right now adept weapons are just lazy reskins with an ugly shader and slightly better stats.

I will probably run a few gm Nightfalls but there is no chance im grinding for a godroll, its just not worth it.

And im not even talking about trials which is by far the most unfun experience i had in any game ever.

I generally like pvp and id wish their would be adept weapons for 6v6 gamemodes as well.

So here it is Papa joe, the solution on how to make adept weapons appealing, entirely for free.

Feel free to use it."
1,Buff Well of Radiance (in PvP only),"Dear Bungie,

&amp;#x200B;

Well of Radiance was already a less-than-average subclass before Beyond Light, and it was quickly thrown to the side when Stasis came out. Now, I can't even stay alive in the super without getting completely rolled by a single Stasis ability. I'm a firm believer in making every subclass viable. However, I'm not saying you should make the super immune to the Stasis supers, but at least make the super somewhat immune to slow-afflicting Stasis abilities. Possibly like giving Well of Radiance a Shelter from the Storm effect that only makes you immune to Slow stacks and not like full freezing from a Stasis super, Glacial grenade, or Coldsnap. That's the only buff I actually want for Well of Radiance. I really just want to use my favorite subclass again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

WHY DOESN'T THE WELL OF RADIANCE SLAM ONE-SHOT PEOPLE? It only does 150 impact damage and you have to literally be inside of someone to do full damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

angry well of radiance warlock"

1,Lil flying fish,"I might already been asked here but can someone please give me some clarity about the flying fish thing, was it confirmed to be cut content? Or are we still going to see it…i know there was some quote about it by the team…but i can’t seem to find it."
1,Ascendant challenge not tracking,Is this still bugged? I just picked up my final bone but when I completed it and jumped through the portal I'm still at 4/6
1,"Now that you changed Borealis's element change animation, can you change it's catalyst?","It's catalyst gave it increased reload so it could cycle The Fundamentals easier, but now its just increased reload speed for the heck of it. Maybe give it ""Lightbender"", which gives a combination of Dragonfly and Shield Disorient that gets stronger when Ionic Return is active? Another idea is similar to Hawkmoon's catalyst, increased reload, range and handling while Ionic Trace is active and an extra shot in the mag? Last one I have off the top of my head is rapid matched shield breaks spawn an orb of power. IDK I'm not that creative but I would just love to see this weapon get a more functioning catalyst. Also this is not a priority, I would like catalyst-less weapons like Xenophage, Wish-Ender and Malfeasance to get catalysts first."
1,"Some of you aren’t going to like hearing this, but Eyes of Tomorrow needs to be banned in Gambit.","But woah you’re just salty bc you don’t have it... nope. I haven’t even touched DSC yet so not mad yet (don’t get me started on how long it took me to get anarchy). 

But the reality is because the weapon is just too good at everything. And instead of nerfing it which is the worst thing to do to exotics. Just ban it. 

And here’s my case for why:
1. it’s literally a 1000% upgrade from Truth which is already great. 
2. it’s great at invading. Only got one rocket. No worries, you can still lock the entire team with one rocket. 
3. it’s great at defending. Someone pops over. You get a quick lock and fire, doesn’t matter if you trade they’re dead. 
— plus in defending a 1 for 1 trade is great. 
4. It’s great for killing the boss. 

That’s 3 roles of Gambit. 
I said earlier that I would rather it be banned than locked bc it’s always awful to nerf exotics. The only nerf I could recommend is a longer time to lock and still idk if that would fix it."

1,"On behalf of more casual, single-character players, I'd like to compliment Bungie for the way Bright Dust has been handled recently.","Having the time for one character used to mean skipping 2/3 of the weekly bright dust offering.

Now ? Between the vendor rework, the season pass, and the seasonal challenges (which are great since I can also do them whenever I work), I'm getting literally SHOWERED in bright dust whenever I play. We're barely at the half of the season and I have earned 10k dust already. It's amazing.

I can actually look up the eververse weekly planning knowing I'll have enough dust for basically everything I want. And I can work towards getting a big 4k dust package (that's almost a full armor set !) by working out all the challenges.

As far as cosmetic currencies go, I think this game is more than fair now."
1,I love how high the skill ceiling is with Dead Man's Tale.,"I haven't played this much PvP in probably a year.  I know people hate stasis, but I'm having a ton of fun.  1.25k kills on my current roll of DMT and I can feel myself getting better and better with it the more I use it.  Went from a 1.1 kd early this season, and now I'm consistently dropping 2.0+ kd every game (seriously consistent, like 45 out of my last 50 QP games).

I've been called ""cheesy"" ""toxic"" ""loser"" ""disgrace"" ""sweat"" ""no life"", etc. for running it with Lion Rampants, but I don't care.  This is the most fun I've had in PvP in years, plus I can't get frozen when I'm 50 feet in the air.

Thank you Bungie for adding this weapon and the catalyst, I love it."

1,Is 5450 no longer Legend in Survival?,"So, for this season I just hit 5500, but unlike previous seasons, I didn't see the Glory Rank circle go from 'empty' at 5450, to 'full' at 5500."
1,Does anyone use or have used Destiny Boasting services? If so what do you think?,[removed]
1,Eliminate weapon slot limitations,"With renewed calls for more kinetic specials, I think it’s time for Bungie to remove the kinetic, special and heavy slot limitations. Especially since they are planning more energy types. Kinetics have more damage and would still be useful. Weapons are limited by ammo anyways. 

You could run whatever primary and secondary of your choice. Or go crazy and run a shotgun, machine gun and sword."
1,The post about warlock subclasses being bad is more about stasis being the naturally better option than the other subclasses being bad.,"I feel like you could make similar arguments about hunters and titans in a similar way.

* ""Silence and Squall is a better Blade Barrage""
* ""Burning Maul is barely used in PVP""
* ""Behemoth is a better Striker""
* ""Bottom-tree tether is non-existent in PVP""
* ""You can *outrun* an Arc Staff""

The use of subclasses before Beyond Light was definitely more evenly split than it is right now. Now a large portion of the community defaults into the stasis subclasses, but this isn't because the non-stasis ones are bad (even though some are in need of help). 

Stasis is just the *better* option for the average player. Stasis is just a natural counter to any super which involves getting into close quarters because a freeze/slow will negate your ability to close the gap and, more often than not, lead to you dying.
-
While there are definitely non-stasis subclasses in the current sandbox that I can see being used, Chaos Reach's former ability to get **3-6** supers per game was definitely going to be nerfed."
1,whats banshee selling today,[removed]
1,How does thresh compare to bad juju?,"One of my favorite builds is a bottom tree solar hunter with that bird helm that turns your golden gun into a single shot. Max intelligence coupled with that passive that gives you super energy for headshots means I can take champions out with ease almost always having my super when we get to one.

I have been using bad juju to boost the super gain, but im wondering how my bottom dollar with thresh compares with the juju perk. I'm making these numbers up, but if juju kills give 10% super energy per kill and thresh gives 5%, ill stick with juju. If it's something like 10% juju and 7% thresh, I'll never use the bad juju again.

Does anyone know which perk is better and by how much?"
1,How to rank up on Season 12 pass right now?,"I started playing just after the beginning of S13 and ultimately bought the deluxe DLC that gives you the passes for S12 through S15.

I found out today that I can go to Bungie's website and claim the rank up rewards from S12 also; I'm at rank 6 now for S12 (versus 120 or so for S13). I assume I'm earning S12 XP on the wrathborn hunts, but does anyone know whether there are other ways to farm that XP? There's only so much wrathborn hunting I can do."

1,Finally able to raid because of 12 man,"Bungie, I was able to raid for the first time in Destiny 2 because of the 12 man bug. I am very anti social and never wanted to raid until now, this ability to join a fireteam with 12 guardians has allowed me to join a group to raid without the fear of letting everyone down because I missed a mechanic. I had a blast sitting back learning the raid and the new content, please make this 12 man fireteam a thing!"

1,Why did I just now discover this game.,"Holy. Shit. 


Why why why did no one tell me about this. Something with shooting mechanics on par with COD/Apex, open and beautiful worlds, nearly endless customization, all while being shared and potentially cooperative like Ghost Recon Breakpoint except actually fun. Oh. And Bunjie, the studio that got me started playing games (besides Miyamoto) made this fucking masterpiece??

Goodbye productivity. 

Seriously, I haven't even really begun (from what I can tell, this game is ludicrously complex in depth) and I'm already blown away. 

I just described it to my friend as Apex meets Halo meets Breath of the Wild.  Fuck.

Ill be over on r/fireteams to be finding some friends to explore with, but I just wanted to express my excitement at finally trying this out. Im jealous of yall for having experienced this for the last few years and also very excited to start my own journey, as it doesn't seem like the devs are giving up on this game anytime soon and this sub alone has *2 million members*.


See ya out there."
1,What's the link to the weekly reset website?,"Sorry, this post is absolutely spammy, but i was just released from the hospital, can barely think or see straight, ive tried googling but that was fruitless, so please allowed me this one transgressing post.

1,A couple suggestions to make grinding less frustrating (I'd also like to know your suggestions),"I feel like a lot of the frustrations regarding loot (especially with weapons like bottom dollar) stem from people not knowing when or even *if* they'll get one. It can be very discouraging playing a game mode you'd rather not play with no guarantee that you'll ever get what you're after (I happen to love gambit so this is a suggestion not me venting frustration). I can't be the first person to suggest something like this, but I feel like a token system would alleviate a lot of the frustration. You run a legendary lost sector and don't get your exotic, you get a token. After a certain number of tokens, you can exchange them for the exotic. Even a 20 token requirement would at least make it feel like you're not wasting your time. Hopefully you get it before 20 runs, but at least not getting it would still feel like progress. In addition or if bungie is firmly against a token system, you should get bottom dollar when you reset rank. I really liked that weapons like trust were rewards for ranking up. 

People just need to know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel because the thought of ""I've run 20 gambits and have gotten nothing, do I really want to run another 20 more and still not get the weapon?"" makes it feel like you're wasting your time. I know I'm talking about gambit a lot, but this could be applied to all game modes. Grinding raids for spoils of conquests so you can purchase anarchy is a far more enjoyable experience than praying rngesus blesses you with eyes of tomorrow. 

Another thing that might be worth looking into is to use something like Diablo 3's mercy timer. In Diablo 3, the longer you go without getting a legendary, the more of a chance you have to find one. 

At the end of the day, I play video games. I don't design them. I have almost no knowledge of video game development so these are merely uneducated suggestions. I'm not saying that destiny should just hand out new God weapons because they need to incentivize people to keep playing these different modes. That said this game is about grinding to get multiple versions until you get the perks that fit your play style. It's rarely an ""I got the weapon I was after now I'm done"".  I'm curious to hear how you guys and girls think bungie can make the grind feel more rewarding and less frustrating."
1,More Exotic Armour pieces that have inbuilt champion mods along with their main perk would be Awesome,I use Athrys's Embrace all the time and the fact that it has an inbuilt champion mods feels so good. I feel like some more exotic armours with inbuilt champion mods would free up some of the arm slots for reload mods. Lucky raspberry could use a rework to have this seasons arc grenade overload mod be built into it.
1,Heroic events,"Is it possible to get rarities other than rare from drops? i have yet to find any rarity above blue from these heroic events. (mainly the tangles shore heroic event, where you destroy the cryo vents and freeze the wanted enemy). I was told theres a chance of exotics but i havent even recieved a legendary?"

1,Stasis Legendary Weapons,"Let me preface this by saying I do not know what Bungie are planning to do with Stasis weapons. This is purely a speculative opinion I have and an idea to maybe make the burns on weapons be more than something used to remove enemy shields.

So, there's a few people who think that when Stasis legendary weapons arrive they'll have some special ability that might freeze or slow targets. While that sounds okay, here's why I believe it won't happen.

Solar, Void and Arc legendary weapons have no special effects aside from taking down a shield that matches it's type. More than likely we'll just get a bunch of Stasis weapons and a few enemies will now start displaying Stasis shields.

Now, if they do get a special ability like slowing or freezing enemies. Then that would mean that the original three weapon types will fall behind and likely not want to be used and rather forced to be used just to get rid of shield types. So I was thinking if Stasis does have one of these effects it would be cool to see the original weapons get updated.

\- Solar could leave a small lingering burn effect, like damage over time. But not last as long as say abilities or exotic weapons as to not make them obsolete.

\- Arc could essentially become like a arc web effect but only chain to one other enemy, again as to not take away from exotics and abilities that specialise in that. E.g: Riskrunner or Warlock's Arc Web.

\- Void could suppress enemies, maybe not slow them but make them more susceptible to damge.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said; they could end up just being like all the other legendary weapons we have and do nothing special besides just be another source of weaponry that we use primarily to take down shields. While it'd be cool to have them expand on the actual elemental burns, part of me thinks that won't happen any time soon if at all.

What do you guys think?"

I have been getting back into raiding recently and just completed DSC for the first time last week with an LFG group. Last time I was into raiding was with fat boi Calus and ever since then I just haven't had anyone to play with. However, my clan was recently revived and everyone was drawn back to Destiny. We went into GoS last night and 5 manned the first two encounters which I thought was pretty impressive (all we had time for unfortunately, but was very fun).

My question though is during the first encounter of GoS when you are running through the field with all the cyclops, do we actually have to kill all of them or can you just haul ass through the field to the very end while picking up the juice from the boss?"

I cant stand this games pvp. I find it horribly unfun, unbalanced and just rage inducing and I dont know why

I'm not even bad at multi-player games. I grew up playing CoD, I still play and regularly do fantastic in Gears 5. I play battlefield, etc.
Yet I'm absolutely horrible at this game and it can take me like 10-15 matches just to do my 8 bounties. I mean it took me 7 matches to get 5 kills with a pulse rifle.

I get constantly killed before I can react. It seems EVERYONE is able to land headshots with any weapon no matter how much im running jumping or sliding and them doing the same.  Seems everyone else's guns kill in 3 body shots and mine take near a clip to kill. 

I dont know why this game of all the multi-player games I play pisses me off so bad, but it d9es"

1,A competitive PvE mode would be really beneficial for the game,"Title.

I think having a competitive PvE mode (not gambit, that’s PvEvP, and everything else is cooperative in nature) where we’re actually facing off against other guardians to complete PvE objectives would be so cool. It would give meaning to max power, something needed desperately. It would also give PvE players a mode with infinite replayability and allow for weekly trials like tournaments.

I really think this is something we should at least experiment with

In the Season of the Chosen trailer, there was a section where they were showing off the S.A.B.E.R., but in that shot, there were three guardians, all clad in Destiny 1 style faction armor and weapons. It would appear that they removed that frame from the trailer, but I still have the screenshot here.

Oddly enough, I haven't seen anyone talk about this. These are all ""new"" weapons and armor, and the warlock even has the beloved Hung Jury on their back. If you look at the Dead Orbit tent and (don't quote me on this one) the Future War Cult box, you can see that they've changed colors. The Dead Orbit tent is lacking the green from before, and I think that Future War Cult no longer has that bright shade of blue.  


We also know that canonically, Lakshmi is out on business with Ada-1. We know that Ada-1 is returning. That would open the floor for Lakshmi to return, as well as factions with her.

1,Need armor help/advice please :),"Just getting back into destiny 2 a few days ago, lots of changes I can see. Haven't played it hard since the first year or 2 it was out.

I can see my 400+ gear in the vault can nearly all be dismantled, googled it up, sunsetted that got reversed, but too late :(

I'm a titan, just got past the soft cap, looking to slow down and level in a bit with some armor.

When destiny 2 first started the different worlds had different armor sets with different base stats.

As a titan I can assume now I should be going after armor that is resilient and recovery as a ""base boost.""

I see u can modify, level up and such the gear in general, but after googling for an hour I still can't figure out if there Is some info on farming simple legendary armor with a titan resilient/recovery base Stat installed boost.

Energy level 1 would be fine, I'm not looking for a 2300 hard cap final build just looking to farm a matching titan-ish starting stat set, then upgrade it a bit and keep playing. 

Im assuming all gear now doesn't start out with the same base stats???? If thats the case I can mix/match grab any set and start adjusting. 

I figured there must be some info on set names that give a good initial boost in the resilient and recovery aspect for a titan to upgrade and tweak...

Any help would be appreciated! Surprised I couldn't find this info on Google :("

1,You cant play destiny 2 for it's story/lore/Universe building... At least it feels and looks good.,"TL;DR: Destiny Looks great, the gunplay is amazing.. Main story parts gone.. tough luck.

TL;DR+:but beyond that unless you have played at least a few hours every week since Fomo started kicking into gear, Im sorry but you missed the story... and will find it very hard to get into it.

Any new player/returning player coming back to play the game are just been laughed at because of fomo. (Vaulted content/sunsetting/whatever)

I can pick up destiny 1 right now and make a character again just as I did day 1 and play trough the story and be able to play all content, get max grimoire all over again without worrying if I stop playing for a month or longer a part of the game will be removed and miss out on Story.

Destiny 2 is a big fuck you to anyone who wants to be part of the journey or anyone who comes in late and wanted to take a break every now and then. There's even entire triumph section to say fuck you should have played to get/do these.  (Eg using a tv show below)

You pick up a TV series , You watch the first 2 as they were coming out and they were good but they were a few bad episodes that had promise so you decided to not watch the next season or 2 live no biggie you will just catch up/rewatch before watching the newer episodes... Ohhh an episode here and there were taken out.

(This is when destiny 2 started pushing FOMO)

You cant rewatch every episode to get up to date/enjoy the show no biggie they must have been bad/not important to the overall story....

You watch what you can and you are finally are up to date, the new series (5) is out tomorrow and your mostly caught up.  you are excited to continue watching and immersing yourself in this world that was built.

Ohhhhhhhh.... a few more episodes have been removed here and there from seasons 1-5.

You are enjoying the show for the next few seasons , you stop watching live here and there for a few seasons and miss out on a couple of episodes that were good to watch and see have more context what's happening but Oh well.

(Sunsetting/vaulted content)

OH your new to the tv series no worries, here is season 9-12 the new season 13 will be out soon.

You cant watch any of the old seasons, season 9 you start at has this whole story build up but your lost and dont know who anyone is or what's going on but the CGI is cool and looks good soo you ignore all the talky parts and enjoy the big beautiful CGI effects.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thats destiny 2 right now, it feels great and looks good to play but unless you go out of your way to learn, wtf is happening, who you are and the people around you are.. your best ignoring everything thrown at you and enjoy all the colors and pretty guns and armour you have a chance at getting a chance to get the right stats on."
1,Any advice for someone who hasn't raided since leviathan? Weapons/Group Finding/Etc?,"Heya Guardians. 

I recently got back into destiny and aside from a few issues with PvP am very much enjoying my time with my 2 friends. However, the big shining PvE activity that still eludes me is raids.

I have done a handful of raid runs in D1 (Crota, VoG). And I think I did Leviathan once or twice back in the day. But I struggled to get included due to not using a mic (personal reasons.)

I'm now a bit more able to talk on mic, and want to play some raids but due to limited amount of friends, haven't really had the chance. 

Is there any advice that you guys have for me? Any easy way to find groups, weapons to look out for, tips for available raids, anything really! (I see the letters LFG alot but have no clue what that means).

Thanks for your time!"
1,Is the change to levelling (going from +50 to +10 a season) happening starting season 14?,"Only reason I ask is that the Season Of Arrivals gear, which is due to sunset in Season 15 (so S14 is its last season) still has a power cap of 1360, suggesting that it WILL be a +50. I thought Bungie said that it was being changed to a +10, but I dont know WHEN thats happening?"
1,Maybe it's just me but looking back on content I feel like Oryx was the last time I felt there was an actual threat in Destiny that felt so rewarding to defeat,"And allow me to elaborate more on that before passing judgement. Ghaul was a bigger threat. I mean it was the first time we were ever lightless. However, tying up the story in the main story line and leaving us with the Leviathan as a raid really shortened that feeling of ""danger."" Calus was hardly a threat and actually provided us with rewards. The Taken King expansion drew out the plot a lot longer and tied it all up with the King's Fall raid. Seeing how huge Oryx was during the raid and actually having a challenge to defeat the main threat at the time was so much more satisfying. Not to mention, in my opinion, the dreadnaught was one of my favorite destinations in destiny history and very elaborate with quite a few secrets and things to do. Plus watching victims get ""taken"" by being sucked into a black hole was pretty threatening.

Fast forward to more recent events; the pyramids/darkness were ominous and creepy last season, taking over our ghost and speaking through them, the floating bodies everywhere. It's been the backstory of all of destiny, the ""darkness chasing the light."" Then it arrives and... Gives us its power? And Taniks? What's he gonna do? He was snow-covered lying under a pile of scrap. I throughly enjoy the DSC raid, don't get me wrong. I just don't really feel like in the Destiny universe it compares to defeating Oryx and that nothing has really come close to giving me that feeling of a drawn out accomplishment that means as much."

To my knowledge it gives both ammo for your team and yourself every time.
The mod provides special ammo on every yellow health bar enemy you make a finisher on and heavy ammo on every ´mini bosses´, which you can find more or less on each side you have to go and also the Knight-Blocker.

The best part about this that no one else have to run the Aeon but there are some great bonus you can get by more people using them ofcourse.

1,Exotic Weapon Buff Suggestions(S13 version),"There are quite a number of Exotics that are just outright underperforming lately, and some that need either minor changes or major changes to just be more usable. I didn't include Eyes of Tomorrow as it's 'bugged', and I also didn't include The Queenbreaker and Sleeper Simulant as their issues are rooted in the fact that Linear Fusions are just... BAD. Anyway, these are my suggestions...

**Rat King**  
Rat Pack: Increase the max distance you can be away from fireteam members using Rat King to receive the bonus from this perk by 1.5x

Rat Pack: Perk bonus multiplier varies based on max fireteam member count. Ex: Max fireteam count being 3 players would result in receiving x2 from an ally rather than x1.

Goal: Rat King currently requires a very tight knit team to take advantage of it's Exotic perk. This causes it to be a very poor option for many activities such as Raids where players typically split off from each other. It's also very underwhelming in activities with a low player cap such as Strikes and Dungeons.

**MIDA Multi-Tool**  
Catalyst: Replace Outlaw with Killing Wind.

Goal: MIDA Multi-Tool already has a very high reload speed, and Outlaw feels like a very unworthy and wasted increase in power from a Catalyst that is quite rare and difficult to complete. Killing Wind would appeal more to the speed fantasy that MIDA has without making it too powerful.

**Malfeasance**  
Explosive Shadow: Reduced amount of bullets to activate the perk from 5 to 4.

Goal: Malfeasance is quite an underwhelming Exotic all around. With it's recent 33% mag size buff increasing it's total ammo count in a magazine to 20, this is the perfect opportunity to make the gun better by reducing the number of shots to activate Explosive Shadow from 5 down to 4. This doesn't change overall damage numbers at all, but it does give it better DPS and a much more valuable and usable niche in both PvE/PvP.

**The Last Word**  
Fan-Fire: Remove penalties of firing from the hip, similar to Dead Man's Tale's catalyst.

General: Controller aim assist reduced to compensate.

Goal: The Last Word feels impeccable on controller, but on MKB it still feels very, very bad. The goal here is to make the weapon feel good while firing from the hip for PC players, while also reeling it in a bit for console, as to not make it overpowered there.

**Coldheart**  
Cold Fusion: Now increases stability and weapon handling the longer the trigger is held down.

General: Damage increased by 20% in PvE.(Also applies to Ruinous Effigy, Prometheus Lens, and Wavesplitter)

Goal: Coldheart suffers because it's intrinsic perk is simply that it's a Trace Rifle, which is redundant now that we have many Trace Rifles in the game now. Trace Rifles are also behind in terms of damage compared to every Special weapon in the game(maybe barring Fusion Rifles, I'm not too sure though) rendering them entirely irrelevant outside of Divinity, so a 20% damage buff should help them compete.

**Graviton Lance**  
Cosmology: Increased the damage of the void orbs by 15%.

General: Damage increased against Minor and Major enemies by 10%.

Goal: Graviton Lance currently falls short compared to many primary Exotics that excel in mass combatant clearing. It's outclassed by Huckleberry and Sunshot in short-mid range, and the bows at longer ranges. These damage increases should help it be a more competitive option in PvE.

**Hard Light**  
Volatile Light: Reverted the nerf that removed no damage fall off from the weapon.

Goal: Hard Light was a clear outlier when Adaptive frame Auto Rifles received a damage buff in Season 10, it was nerfed about a month and a half later, and rightfully so. However, that didn't solve the problems of Adaptives being overly strong. Skip forward to Season 12 and Adaptive Auto Rifles had their damage reeled in, lowering their optimal TTK, yet Hard Light received *no* compensation buffs for this. As a result, it's currently effectively worse than it was prior to Season 10. I believe reverting this part of the nerf to the weapon should be enough to make it a bit more viable again.

**Tarrabah**  
Ravenous Beast: No longer immediately loses progress on Ravenous Beast when stowed, and instead will slowly drain it until the weapon is drawn again. Progress drains faster in PvP and slower in PvE.

Goal: Tarrabah is held back greatly by it's own mechanic, as it forces you to essentially only use the weapon if you want to take advantage of it at all. This creates very bad gunplay, as the game revolves around swapping between your three weapon slots. Making this change should help relieve that problem without making the weapon a bit overtuned.

**Ruinous Effigy**  
Literally just revert the nerfs, don't need a 'Goals' section here. The changes were unwarranted and turned a fun and decent gun into a mediocre and underwhelming gun.

**Legend of Acrius**  
General: Moved to the Energy slot and requires Special ammo to use.

General: Damage reduced in PvP to reduce lethality as compensation.

Goal: Legend of Acrius is currently... well... just not good. It deals similar damage to that of Slug Shotguns, yet it has less ammo, slower damage output, and awful handling. Overall the weapon is pretty bad in the heavy slot, however, simply putting it in the special slot could help make the gun strong once more.

**D.A.R.C.I.**  
General: Moved to the Energy slot and requires Special ammo to use.

General: Damage increased by 10% in PvE.(Also applies to Whisper of the Worm, Cloudstrike, and Borealis)

Goal: Similar to Legend of Acrius, this weapon is extremely underwhelming right now. Not only does it do similar, if not worse, damage numbers to special ammo weapons, but in PvP it is abysmal due to the nerfs to it's Archetype and no longer kills in two body shots. Moving it to the special slot could help make the gun a better option.

**Worldline Zero**  
Tesseract: No longer requires sprinting to activate and is the normal power swing.

Goal: Worldline has really just functioned as a 'mobility' enhancer, which for an Exotic is... well, look at MIDA Multi-Tool. Making this simple change would help Worldline stand a chance in PvE content for DPS for once. Sprinting to charge it after waiting for your Sword Energy to recharge just feels tedious. The other swords require minimal effort for their power/special attacks. The Lament simply requires you to block, and the rest just require you to hit the power attack button.

**One Thousand Voices**  
Unforeseen Repercussions: When directly hitting a target with the beam from this weapon, the delayed explosions will now stick to enemies rather than where the beam impacted.

General: Damage increased by 10%

Goal: One Thousand Voices has decent burst damage but is held back by low mag size, and a slower charge time. Increasing it's damage slightly should help it be a contender in endgame activities. The first change should also help consistency. I've had many times where the target I'm trying to damage with it simply takes minimal damage because they move fast enough to escape where the impact of the weapon's beam was.

**Black Talon**  
Catalyst: Reversal now ignores the damage reduction on power attacks when sword energy isn't full. Time to take advantage of Reversal increased to 2 seconds.

Goal: The catalyst for this sword has been effectively useless since the Sword changes in S10. This simply fixes that.

**Leviathan's Breath**  
Draw Time: Reduced from 1328 to 1028.

General: Now takes advantage of Bow Reserves when catalyst is applied. Increases ammo count from 15 &gt; 18.

Goal: Leviathan's Breath has sucked since S8 and will continue to suck until either it's draw time is reduced or it's damage is increased. I think it does plenty damage per shot, but the draw time needs to be lowered. The second bit just allows it to actually take advantage of armor mods, which it should be able to in general.

**Salvation's Grip**  
Cryocannon: Stasis crystal formation from firing the weapon now creates a circular formation of 5 crystals when fully charged rather than a small inconsistent cluster of crystals.

Goal: Just to make this weapon feel a bit less gimmicky? Fully charging a shot should feel good, right now it feels worse than the Glacier Grenade."
1,Astral horizon should either just have quickdraw removed or better yet put it back in the loot pool,"Removing it from the loot pool was the worst way to handle this, in my opinion quickdraw should either just be nerfed or just added back to astral horizon because currently the one from a few seasons ago is leaps and bounds ahead of the wish.com version we have this season, no one wants pulse monitor or lead from gold when there are people running around with quickdraw or even slideshot, which is so much better than the gross perk pool astral has now, so to sum up I would personally like the old perk pool back but nerfing quickdraw would suffice. Thank you for coming to my red talk."
1,I entered a 12 Player Garden of Salvation Raid and finished 9 hours later with only 1 other original fireteam member,"A friend and I have been trying to get Divinity for a while and figured with 12 player raids active, this was our best shot. We were very wrong. We entered a 12 man raid at 7pm last night. Very few people knew how to do the raid, but we figured with 12 people and some guides we could figure it out. I disconnected an hour into the run and obviously couldn’t reconnect because it was a 12 player fireteam. I figured that was it for me and turned off the game. Fast forward to midnight. My friend texts me. They’re at the boss encounter and have dropped to 5 players. I rejoin because I heard I can still get Divinty as long as it’s the same raid instance. Multiple people quit and are replaced over and over again. Three hours later and even my friend quits (understandable, he’s been going for 8 hours at this point). Now, it’s just me, one other original fireteam member, and an lfg player we picked up along the way who was kind enough to coach us on the encounter. At this point we’re running out of patience, but the last two of us don’t want all our time to have been a waste. The third player fills the last three spots with some of his clan mates and we knock the boss out in two attempts. I got Divinity. 2/12 members of the original fireteam finished the raid and got Divinity. Shoutout to FreddyStaysBased for suffering through that 9 hour experience and YuuSoldyaBoi for helping us out. I’m never touching Garden of Salvation again."
1,Prismatic recaster tier 2/3 weapon lenses,"To unlock the tier 2 and tier 3 prismatic lenses for the weapons, do I need to kill enemies with certain weapons in battlegrounds or is it anywhere?

Trying to get a code duello with impulse amplifier and lasting impression, so if I can quickly bash out the rocket launcher kills on shuro chi I’d rather get the tier 3 lense than slog through 100s of tier 1 lenses."
1,Content vaulting just isn’t right (yes it’s one of those posts you’ve seen before once again. You don’t like it? Don’t read it),"I’m gonna be honest, no one should be ok with having the content they paid for be taken away. What happened, was a transaction. You cannot take that away from us, something we bought from you, bungie. What other games actually do this? And don’t give me some bullshit excuse to take away content like this bungie. I don’t see other developers handling their game’s technical issues that result from much larger file sizes than y’all’s doing this. With bungie’s size as a company becoming larger and larger, there should be enough manpower to tackle these technical issues. The narrative reasons are bullshit too. You say destiny is an evolving game, but that doesn’t warrant taking out content. How are new destiny players going to understand that current narrative when they don’t have context? How are they supposed to know that the crow was once prince uldren, the one who killed cayde, when they can’t play forsaken once it’s vaulted in the future? The narrative is basically “you had to be there” now. There’s no way new players can get invested into y’all’s universe and the characters in it like this. When all my friends heard about content vaulting when playing season of arrivals, they all basically dropped the game once beyond light dropped because of it, and it hurt. Alright Reddit I’m done. Flame me."
1,I hope Bungie is applying some lessons learned with respect to stasis in advance of the Witch Queen,"Just some thoughts here.  We're now &gt;4 months past the launch of Beyond Light, and we're still receiving large balance patches.  While subclasses often get minor updates and changes throughout the life of the game, what we're seeing with stasis is largely unprecedented.

I'm no software engineer or industry PM, but this kind of work costs time and money.  How many devs are focused on this, that could be focused on the Witch Queen or other projects?  It's important they get it right this fall/winter, because that will enable them to expend resources elsewhere and prioritize better.

Don't get me wrong - I love this game, but I'd like to see the next subclass/element arrive in a more balanced state.  It's hard to understand why it was so imbalanced, but I understand COVID-19 probably played a role.

I hear people discussing public test servers a lot...I'm not sure how well that would work in a narrative driven game, but some more deliberate testing and balancing needs to happen at a minimum.  Things like this suck up too many resources, and impact the rest of the game, whether or not we see it.  How many projects have been delayed or cancelled due to a lack of resources?  We'll never know."
1,"Despite PVP Balance issues, Stasis integrates lore and gameplay very well","When Stasis first was revealed to be an ice/freezing based subclass, I was skeptical as to how exactly this was supposed to reflect the Darkness. It was black-blue ice, sure, but I couldnt help but feel a bit disappointed that it wasnt something more aesthetically linked to my mental image of ""Darkness"".

&amp;#x200B;

However, now that Beyond Light has been out for months and weve gotten our hands on the subclass, I realize that its so much more than just ""ice"", and Im pretty happy with what Bungie has crafted. It actually integrates many themes associated with the Darkness in the lore and story with the way it behaves during gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

*  The Darkness as the anchor to the Light

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Knife had a million blades.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you were giant, powerful and swift. But the Knife pinned you. Cut your godly flesh away.

Taken from ""Ghost Fragment: The Traveler 3

&amp;#x200B;

The lore piece above is from the ""Dreams of Alpha Lupi"" series from Destiny 1, which are written from the Traaveler´s point of view. The specific fragment I linked describes the battle between the Traveler and the Pyramid Ships during the Collapse.

The Traveler describes being ""pinned"" before being cut away and wounded.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as basically every pvp player has learned since Beyond Light, what does it feel to be frozen by Stasis?

Youre pinned in place. Frozen, but conscious. You see the person who will kill you begin to shoot you and your health begins to slowly tick. Or its a Hunter and you see them jump, bracing for the inevitable Shatterdive. Or its a Titan and you see them slide toward you.

You can try and break free. The button promp is there. Most of the time it is futile however, and you just die.

You feel helpless. Like the Traveler battling the Pyramids.

&amp;#x200B;

Or how Supers can be frozen by Stasis and sometimes defeated afterward. Something that just feels fundamentally *wrong.* 

But read the lore piece again. 

""You were giant, powerful and swift. But the Knife pinned you. Cut your godly flesh away.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is a gameplay flavor win. The Darkness is the only thing that can shut down the Light in such an absolute way. Take the power fantasy of a Guardian and stop it dead in its tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Darkness as a force of control and order in contrast to the Light as a force of chaos and possibility

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The gardener got up and brushed their knees. ""Every game we play, this one pattern consumes all the others. Wipes out every interesting development. A stupid, boring exploit that cuts off entire possibility spaces from ever arising. There's so much that we'll never get to see because of this… pest.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;They chewed at their cracked lip, which existed only because this is an allegory. ""I'm going to do something about it,"" they said. ""We need a new rule.""

Taken from ""The Final Shape"", from the Unveiling lore book.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;All you will do, I said, with rising panic|fury, is delay the dominant pattern that will overrun the others. It is inevitable. One final shape.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""No, it'll be different. Everything will be different, everywhere you look.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Everything will be the same. Your new rule will only make great false cysts of horror full of things that should not exist that cannot withstand existence that will suffer and scream as their rich blisters fill with effluent and rot around them, and when they pop they will blight the whole garden. Whatever exists because it must exist and because it permits no other way of existence has the absolute claim to existence. That is the only law.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""No,"" the gardener said, ""I am the growth and preservation of complexity. I will make myself into a law in the game.""

Taken from ""The First Knife"", from the Unveiling lore book.

&amp;#x200B;

The fundamental difference, and conflict, between the Light and the Darkness is one between simplicty and complexity.

The Winnower, entity behind the Darkness, believes in the order of the original proto universe that was the Garden. Where only one possiblity, one pattern, managed to thrive at the expense of all other possibilities. The Winnower believes that the universe, and all life within it, are heading toward one single conclusion. One single species to survive among a graveyard of trillions, because only one pattern can make it there.

&amp;#x200B;

The Gardener, entity behind the Light, believes in the chaos of life given opportunity. The many possibilties and branching paths the game can explore if it is simply let to do so. The freedom of life to grow in whatever way it pleases and chooses, rather than be forced down a single path because it is simply the most dominant.

&amp;#x200B;

Two opposite ideologies.

&amp;#x200B;

So it makes sense then, that every single Light subclass so far is based on doing raw damage or clearing adds with roaming supers, while Stasis is designed to do one thing extremely well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Control.

&amp;#x200B;

Because this is what the Darkness is in the end. Its oppressive, it stiffles hope and freedom. 

The Pyramids chase the Traveler around, genociding every single species that has received her gifts, turning planets she has terraformed and undoing the work, turning them back to lifeless rocks, or worse, corrupting them and twisting their form, because the Winnower wants a universe where the Light doesnt meddle with what it considers to be the natural order of things.

&amp;#x200B;

So when you go around breaking reality with your super in pvp, Stasis is there to freeze your ass and negate your space magic, because its what the Pyramids have done to the Traveler for millions of years now.

Is it fun gameplay to go against? Depends on who you ask, but this is as Darkness as Darkness can get.

You wanted Darkness subclasses? You get Darkness subclasses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Reality is chaotic and unruly; bind it, and bring it order.

* Darkness as an alluring force

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""You remember on Io,"" Yardarm-14 couldn't contain his enthusiasm, ""we were pinned down inside that shipping container with Phalanxes closing in from all sides, and you—you bastard. You ducked out a little hole in the back and made a run for it. I thought you'd left us behind.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""Never,"" said Lisbon-13 with vehemence. His eyes flashed with anger, but Yardarm-4 didn't seem to notice.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I know. The whole box was rattling with bullets, and there were explosions, and we were shooting when we could, and suddenly, through it all, I hear you screaming. It was like a banshee wail. You came screaming back on an Interceptor—the Psion still in it. You were steering it with the Psion's head!""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I remember.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""And you rammed it through four Phalanxes from the side, and then, and then—you remember this, Rekkana?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I can't forget.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""You splashed that Interceptor across the shields of another Phalanx, and you RODE THE EXPLOSION over the top. And when you hit the ground behind them, BOOM! It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisbon-13 said nothing. It was as if the story had shut him down.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""That's us right now. We're doing what you did. This whole universe is like that container, and the Last City, the Vanguard, the Traveler—they're all inside that box. But we just snuck out of a hole in the back.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;We are no longer forced to endure your torture. There is no veil for you to hide behind. We see you plainly. Your orchestration has led to too many foul notes. All your attempts to subjugate this power have failed.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;You are a plague, and we are the cure. Your army will be eradicated, and the Hive will be a layer of dust, cushioning our footsteps. Trust me—you will hate it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I find myself giddy at these thoughts. Revenge suits me, it seems. I no longer know fear. I am overcome with certainty. When next we come face-to-face, I will remove the bandages that shield me, so I may see you for all you are and all you are not. And you will see me and know that the fire that burns behind my eyes will be your oblivion, suffocating and searing you to ash.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Prepare yourself. I am your ruin.

Taken from ""To the Witch Queen"", from Eris Morn´s Regarding Stasis lore book.

&amp;#x200B;

The lore tabs I linked showcase the psychological effects that Darkness has on its wielders. The first is from Yardarm-14, member of the Kentarch-3 fireteam which embraced the Darkness inside the Black Garden.

The second is from Eris Morn, who wields Stasis as of Beyond Light, possibly even all the way back to Shadowkeep, if the cutscene with her inside the Pyramid Ship is any indication.

&amp;#x200B;

The Darkness *feels* good. It doesnt feel like a force of evil and death. It makes you surer of yourself, more confident in your abilities. Free from shackles and limitations.

Which is ironic, because once youre corrupted youre a tool of the Winnower, while the Light doesnt shackle you to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But think on this lore, and how it feels to use Stasis in pvp and pve. It feels really good, doesnt it?

Its fun, unique, and very very strong. I find it really satisfying to freeze a super and kill the user when I manage to pull it off in Crucible.

It feels amazing to freeze a bunch of enemies with my Titan Behemoth and then slide into them, crushing them all into bits. The Behemoth Super also feels the best, in my opinion, making the world quake as I smash the gauntlet into the ground, freezing everything in front of me as I fly through the air with the melee attack or slide into the crystals, shredding everything around them to bits.

&amp;#x200B;

The sound design as well. The sound of ice crystals being created, the crunch of ice shattering under my might, the reverberating sounds when you cast Winter´s Wrath (which makes everyone in the vicinity go ""oh shit"" if its on Crucible), etc.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all to say, that Stasis *feels* really good in a way the Light subclasses just cannot compare to.

And thats despite me enjoying the lore of this game obsessively, and being aware that the fun ice powers are the biggest no no in the story for many reasons that have been stated to us throughout the years.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is all a flavor win of design, because of course the Winnower would make his powers attractive and alluring.

Why would anyone join the force of genocide and all around evil of this setting willingly? Because what it offers is very difficult to resist.

&amp;#x200B;

Think on what Zavala said at the end of Beyond Light´s campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Kridis is defeated. But it is not the Fallen that concern me now......  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Its us.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Ive had time to think. Guardians are not immune to corruption. The pursuit of power has divided us before.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I dont know what comes next. But I know- I know- that we must remain in the Light.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I see fractures already. If we bend, we break.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Guardians must not use the Darkness. This is the Vanguard´s official position.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reads kind of like a joke now, doesnt it? Has anyone here seriously followed Zavala´s order?

Most havent. Stasis is rampart on pvp, strikes, gambit, raids, everywhere. The Darkness is everywhere.

Zavala, the highest ranking authority within the Guardians, got completely ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

But there arent any consequences to using the fun ice powers right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, not for now at least."
1,If you're looking for something to do in Destiny and have never tried a raid before - Try a Raid!,"Raiding for the average player in Destiny isn't the most common thing, but I wish that more people would give it shot. Raids are some of the best experiences you can have in the gaming industry, Especially going in blind. Going in with a full fireteam of people that have never done a specific raid and figuring out those mechanics is incredibly rewarding and satisfying. LFG can be a crazy place sometimes, but I know I've certainly met hundreds of incredible, hilarious groups that make the experience fun for everyone involved. In short, if you have never tried a raid for any reason, give it a shot! You don't need the greatest gear, mods, or anything like that, just a willingness and patience to learn."
1,How to get 7 kills in 1 invasion triumph?,"Ive been struggling with this triumph for MONTHS. Every single time i invade, once i get the 4th kill, it automatically pulls me back. I have absolutely 0 clue on how to get to 7. Ive looked up clips on youtube on how to do it and everyone ive seen either lets them stay and just keep killing or they get pulled right at 4 and just get a lucky super that gets the whole team. There has to be a better way than just getting lucky, right?"
1,Stasis has made PvP a miserable experience.,"I genuinely believe stasis should be disabled for PvP.

Now I know there's been some good nerfs in the right direction, but I just don't think such heavy stun mechanics belong in a game with such tight controls and heavily movement reliant combat.

Stasis is one of the few classes where the grenade, melee and super almost all lead to a near unavoidable death, and it's frustrating to be locked in place and forced to watch.

It seems stasis ranges from unfair feeling to blatantly stupid, take for example, the hunter super. Does it need to last so long? Maybe. Does it need to move and chase people? Absolutely not. You touch it and you die. You sometimes respawn in the one that killed you since it can be fired from so far away. It's ridiculous.

The grenades encourage some of the silliest plays I've seen in destiny. Running to the enemy control point at the beginning of the match, just to lob a cold dome that sucks and freezes everyone inside for a free follow-up special grenade launcher shot shouldn't be so easy for people to pull off. 

The grenade with the seeking projectile shouldn't have a blast radius that catches you if you jump away, or can snag multiple people, it seeks in, that should be enough.

It feels like if you aren't playing stasis, you're handicapping yourself. Even moreso if you don't play hunters. I'm not saying Destiny has had the best track record for versatile PvP we all remember the days of Thorn, Last Word, The MIDA, etc. But I honestly feel it's never felt like the scales have been this tilted before. 

I just hate this feeling that so many deaths feel undeserved, that my toe skimmed a shard of ice and my enemy gets to run up and kill me for it, or a hunter just getting to fire and forget with their super. 
At least look me in the eyes as you kill me. 

Sorry for the long ass rant I know there's a million others like it, I just needed to get this off my chest. I took a break back when shadowkeep dropped and came back at the beginning of this season.
Between all this and sunsetting it just feels like the game has stripped away the variety of many things in favour of a new, worse direction. 

Stasis is fine and fun in PvE, but it's too extreme for PvP is what I feel, and I hope I've managed to convey why. 
Thanks for reading."
1,Give cold-heart some cold in a unique way,"Rather than ignore the lore of the gun and make the beam cold, consider making it have an alt fire of a stasis slow to freeze blast based on the amount of the mag fired in one trigger pull before hand. This gives it a tie in to the name more directly,  a new exotic perk that isn't ""just a trace rifle"", and means it can serve as an add clear device after dumping damage into a major or boss enemy."
1,Has Destiny 2 Patrols Improved? (Bit of a rant),"So I haven't played since SoA, and despite numerous times trying to get D2 reinstalled since then its been a real pain since my ps4 absolutely hates d2 for no reason. 

But the thing is, I don't care much for strikes or crucible that much. From what I've heard, Crucible now is an balanced rage-fest. I mean, its always been like that, but still.

But what I'm really worried about are the patrols. To be honest, patrols are my favorite part of destiny. I absolutely love them. But when I played D2 in SoA, I always found them to be bit of a downgrade in D2 compared to D1 patrols. Most people probably didn't notice this, but I doubt most people even bother with patrols.

My 2 main problems with the patrols in d2:

Less variety. In d1, even scavenging patrols had variety. Gathering wire wraps, shock cores, cabal belts, hive dust, etc. But in d2, I always ended up getting the same things all the time. Journals for trostland, rune tablets for Ana, and fallen junk for failsafe. It was always the same thing every time.
Even the dialogue has less variety. In d1, you had plenty of dialogue for each mission from a multitude of characters from zavala to eva to even the factions. When doing patrols in d2, however, its always the exact same lines from the exact same person. After grinding for a ship on mars, I was absolutely sick of Ana's voice. 

D1 patrols actually felt important. Felt like I was actually helping the city. Holiday needs parts for our ships? I'll grab them off of dead vex and fallen. Zavala needs the area cleared for a strike? Sure (heck, that line felt immersive since I was always seeing strike teams pop up after doing an extermination mission).  Eva Levante needs those swivel turrets for... decorative purposes? Ok! But in d2, its the same darn line for the same darn mission from the same darn person over and over again. 

But in D2 I recall Devrim going off about how the Farm needs supplies but he's sending me off to get... journals? What are journals going to do to help us in the wild?  What about red legion ""supplies""? I doubt the people will be able to eat whatever is in there, much less use it. Some parts at least felt important though. Sloane needs tools for repairing the arcology structures? sure, but I don't see how hive runes are going to work with that. Asher needs stuff to research? Ok, but that only helps him, not the city. And Failsafe, well... all her missions can be chalked up to boredom. I don't feel like I'm helping the city or its people in d2. helping out the farm and individuals, sure, but not the city. 

I want to help the city. I don't want to be the spotlight Guardian, the hero of the story. I want to be that Guardian who keeps your ship supplied, the people fed, who gives eva the stuff she needs to keep you looking cool, the guy who gets the vanguard the intel for the strikes, and the guy who clears that strike zone for you. Killing gods? Thats all you, my friends.

So after that little rant, I'm wondering: did the patrols get better after SoA? Do they feel better? Is there more variety and immersion again? Or is the Exo Stranger now sending us to pick up all the bullets we've littered across Europa?"

1,What class should I main?,"Hello everyone, I have a quick question for anyone that can help me. I've been going back and forth on my main character for months now, and it's starting to hold me back in terms of grind, but also in enjoyment, as I have to do every quest multiple times. Back in Destiny 1, I had one of each character, and moved around a fair amount, though I mostly played Warlock since I did a lot of solo content. Lately, however, I just don't have the time I used to, and I need to focus my attention on one particular character. I mostly play PvE, but I do spend my fair shar of time in the Crucible, though I don't really do Trials or raids due to a lack of people to play with.  


In PvP, I tend to have a playstyle that is more about flanking and surprising the enemy, rather than just plowing into the team. I like to mainly use snipers and HC's for this, since I can be effective from any range. I tend to get caught out by myself a lot, as I don't really move with the team due to my flanking style.  


I want to start with my pros and cons of each, to explain my reasons for playing a class. I will not be including Titan, as I have never really enjoyed the class as a whole, even in D1. I dislike the intense melee focus it has, as it doesn't fit in the way that I like to play Destiny.   


***Hunter:***  


With the hunter, I really enjoy the movement (no surprise there), and how fluid it feels to play. I also like the fact that when playing higher end PvE, I'm not just stuck playing support class every time. The look and style of the armor is also something I really like. I find most of the abilities to be fun, and the dodge has saved me more times than I can count.   


I dislike the squishiness of the character, since I mostly spec for recovery and mobility, and I tend to get one-shotted by most of the major enemies. I also really do not like arcstrider in any capacity, I find it to be underwhelming and not as fun to play as something like arc blade from D1.  


***Warlock:***  


With Warlock, I feel like I can be effective in pretty much anything the game throws at me, and I seem to have an ability or exotic for any situation. I also tend to favor their jump the most, as I feel like I can hit any ledge or land wherever I want with little difficulty, or with burst glide I can be the fastest player on the fireteam. I also really enjoy how a lot of the subclasses fit and build off of each other, example something like TTD. While most of the armor looks bad to me, the ones that look good are incredible in my opinion (though still now as good as D1, looking at you Crota set with full ornaments).  


The issues I have with warlock are more with how they feel in crucible and raids. In crucible, I feel limited to using either TTD or Chaos Reach, the latter of which is getting nerfed. I feel like I die more in blink than any other movement ability in the game, and it gives you major downsides. I also feel like there are few exotics to use, as most seem catered around PvE. In  raids, I hate being relegated to using Well all day every day, as I fid the subclass to be extremely boring to play.   


Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me with this decision. The classes are a huge time commitment, so I want to pick wisely. Thanks!!"
1,The 120 HC Meta?,"I’m not a big PVP guy.  I pretty much stick to QP Control and Iron Banner; and usually only play till I complete my bounties.  I do enjoy PVP but I find it stresses me out and that’s not why I play video games (side topic for another day).

Recognizing that 120 HCs are the meta right now I grinded Gambit for a decent Bottom Dollar. So naturally, I hop into some QP to test out the new toy....I don’t get it??  I hand a few good games and was able to get some awesome two taps, but overall I lost a lot of gunfights and probably played some of my worst PVP in a while.

To date, I’ve used ARs and PRs as my primary and faired pretty well.  Then after some digging, I’ve learned that the TTK for 120s is 1s and the body shit TTK is 1.5s! Slower than both ARs and PRs?? 

My question is...am I missing something? What makes the 120s meta and are they Ideal for six player modes or just comp. Should I keep using them till I get better at landing consistent headshots or just cut my losses and stick to the tried and true Dad Rifles?

I appreciate any honest input. Oh and I have a Bottom Dollar for sale! :)"
1,"Imagine finishing all of your quests and bounties, and going to your quest tab to see it empty. Wouldn't that be amazing?",That's it.
1,Vorpal Weapon or Lasting Impressions? Also a couple of other questions on RL.,"I got a Sleepless with vorpal weapon but i was wondering if it's better than a code duello with lasting impressions. I don't know the numbers so i don't know how much each of those perks increase the dps. Can anyone tell me which would be better? Also does impulse amplifier increase dps in any way? IIRC on grenade launchers velocity increased damage and decreasing blast radius was good with spike nades... Is it the same on rocket launchers? Or velocity has no impact on dps AND blast radius does not affect damage on single target?

Thanks a lot."
1,"Bungie, could you consider adding solo queue to Gambit?","Title, really.

If competitive pvp has it, I dont see any real reason for Gambit not to. 

It's happened to us all, load in to a game and get absolutely stomped by a stacked team, while your crew of randoms never stood a chance.

I think adding a solo queue could alleviate a lot of the pain associated with the game mode, and make it more appealing to solo players too.

Thoughts?"
1,"Was punching mobs in patrol for a bounty, got synthoceps","Oh, the irony."
1,Rework for sparrows,"We got ghosts reworked with mods and so on. Time to take a look at sparrows.
1st step - make legendary sparrows 160 too, blue and green ones 140. Some legendary sparrows (last wish one) are rare to get and its just underwhelming to see its a 150 so u only have it to feel good about having it.
2nd step - bring back HORNS from d1. Yes yes reused content NO ONE CARES. You can ride around and beep at EVERYTHING.
3rd step - make trails work like transmat effects. Having ability to swap your trail to any other one will just make riding your fav sparrow more fun."
1,"I think Bungie needs to buff exotic weapons, here's how.","Exotic weapons aren't utilized as much as legendary weapons for one key reason: Icarus Grip. As of this moment, console (PS4 and Xbox) needs Traction on their boots to have a tighter turn radius. PC does not need this mod. So I suggest Bungie giving console intrinsic Traction, and putting Icarus Grip on our boots. This also acts as an indirect nerf to PC special ammo, as they usually run 2x scav perks on their boots, this change will force them to use 1x scav perk and icarus grip."
1,Newbie question: do I have to unlock all of the Stasis stuff with all the characters?,"I just got the second grenade option in Stasis with my main, and I was thinking it would be fun to try with my Warlock... but it was a massive slog to get this far and also repeating story quests is lame.

Is there a way of unlocking Stasis account-wide?"

1,Want to join a fun clan,"I’ve been apart of a clan that my friends started when forsaken came out. Sadly, they stopped talking and stopped getting on the game.

You can contact me on here or on Xbox (gamer tag: Codeshift6)"

1,We should be able to turn off aim assist,I’ve had at times where I line up a shot and then a enemy walks infront of me and drags my shot away from my original target.  I think we should have a option in the menu to change the strength of the aim assist and if we want it or not
1,My Warlock GM build for Devils Lair tomorrow.,"Just some background im a hardcore D2 Pve player whos gotten conqueror every season so far. Just giving my build to help some of you guys complete the Grandmaster tomorrow. Just remember take it slow and team shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons,

&amp;#x200B;

Kinetic : Succession with anti barrier (reconstruction and recombination with a major spec) Im mainly using sucession because its a 72RPM sniper which means it does the highest amount of damage per shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Energy : Imperial needle with overload (Archers tempo and opening shot with major spec) Mainly using this bow to cover all element. Perks dont really matter too much with this but archers tempo is preferred.

&amp;#x200B;

Heavy: Anarchy mainly because i can just shoot 2 on an enemy and let the tick damage do its thing. Mainly gonna be useful against brigs, the tank and the boss. will be useful against champions.

&amp;#x200B;

Subclass is well of radiance for obvious reasons. Make sure to use healing grenades a lot cause that overshield can be the difference between you getting one shot by a sniper.

&amp;#x200B;

Amour mods

&amp;#x200B;

Helmet, Grenade launcher ammo finder and sniper rifle ammo finder, high energy fire

&amp;#x200B;

Arms, overload bow, Anti barrier sniper, taking charge

&amp;#x200B;

Chest piece (phoenix protocol exotic), Resilience mod, 2 concussive dampeners and stacks on stacks.

Boots, resilience mod, sniper scavenger (from artifact so it only takes 1 energy), grenade launcher scav and supercharged (allows you to have 4 stacks of charged with light up to a maximum of 5 if your running multiple of these)

&amp;#x200B;

Class item, Sundering glare (artifact mod), perpetuation and protective light.

&amp;#x200B;

Charged with light helps you to take out champions faster due to high energy fire giving you a 20% damage increase. and protective light will help you stay alive. Very useful inside a well of radiance.

&amp;#x200B;

The main strategy would be to focus smaller ads and then take out champions later once you cleared most of the ads. Make sure your always team shooting champions and majors. Communicate with your team so your all focusing the same champions, bosses or majors. 

&amp;#x200B;

In places with overload champions remember that you can stun them to stop them from shooting you and focus ads while their stunned. It makes it a lot easier to manage them. Since your a warlock make sure to place constant rifts so your teammates are always healing which will also give you increased ability regen due to the subclass perks. 

&amp;#x200B;

1,What are the best mods/builds to use for mid to high level content?,"So I’m kinda new to destiny and with so many mods which sound so similar it’s quite confusing to choose the right ones. 
I was wondering also which element I have to keep my armour in so that I can use the best mods tied to elements. Like for cwl and warmind mods how many arc, solar and void pieces do I need.

If I could get an idea on how to incorporate all these mods and also weapons to start making good builds, it would be really helpful in tacking content like dungeons and nightfalls and my goal is to finally get that beautiful solo prophecy emblem."

1,Advicw on what to buy,"A friend of mine started destiny weeks ago and he ask me what should he buy because he does not have the money to buy everything and i not totally sure because BL has the stasis and DSC, we have the season that right now i found it very enjoyable, and we have the raids from the older expansions. So, what do you think he should buy?"
1,"There should’ve been an allegiance quest, like in season of the drifter, where we choose between the Vanguard or Caiatl.","I feel like this would be pretty cool if it allowed us to work more closely with Caiatl or the Vanguard. Another thing is that we’ve seen that Caiatl’s intentions aren’t to really oppose the vanguard, it’s mainly the other cabal trying to please her, so this would make more sense because we couldn’t just become an enemy of the city for just a quest. This could also change things, like in presage it would be caiatal sending us to investigate, instead of Osiris. Then on week 2 it’s Osiris that tells us not to interfere on the ship instead of Caiatl."
1,Destiny Feel Great To Play With One Exception: Hitting Literally Anything In The Air,"Getting thrown into a pit from a wall because I bumped against an edge, or stomped away by a boss and then being unable to change my momentum as the Architect claps me or I'm otherwise juggled to death by Ogre lasers, is not fun."
1,Presage sucks for repeating content,"Playing Pressage for the first time was a really, really nice experience.

A very spooky and claustrophobic experience to tell the story. 

Playing it the first time the boss was a real clutch.

But having to play it multiple times for the seasonal challenge and on master difficulty breaks the mission. 

After knowing how the puzzles go and where enemies are, it just becomes a long chore. The only interesting parts are the hangar fight and the boss fight. 

A run takes 30 minutes if you are playing on point with state of the art loadout. But for many that will be more. 

The boss fight itself is a huge cheese-fest that (as it apparently has become normal) is designed around owning Anarchy. Bonus points for relying on the janky jump mechanics and holding on to ledges. Nothing better than bumping into pipes that eat your jump when you try to jump up the vent to get to the upper area or your guarding deciding to not hold onto the ledge or the boss just hitting you through the floor or the boss disappearing and appearing in front of you to for quick one-clap.

So how could Bungie improve this mission and possible future missions without sacrificing the exposition of the story?

Let us unlock shortcuts. I'm pretty sure crawling through kilometers of vents is not the most ideal way to traverse a ship. So in successive playthroughs we unlock doors to get one from one section to the next without going through the repetitive content. Maybe after the third playthrough one has all shortcuts unlocked."
1,BrayTechTrials:TheSnowdome," BrayTechTrials:TheSnowdome  
 

Context: A hidden facility on Europa was found where BrayTech tested and trained there unique Exotech. A circular testing ground that can now be entered through a hole in the damaged roof. A now perfect training spot for guardians.   
 

Setting&amp;Rules: This playlist is taking place in a circular training environment „The Snowdome“. Guardians can compete here for Trials specific loot under a unique ruleset. For every round you qualify for the Snowdome gets smaller to compensate for the lack of guardians in the further rounds.  
 

It starts with a 12-Man FFA and the first 10 Guardians that reach 10 Kills are qualified for the the next round  
 

The next round starts with 10 Guardians and the first 8 to reach 10 kills are qualified.  
 

The next round starts with 8 Guardians and the first 6 to reach 10….you get the point  
 

The pattern repeats itself until Round 5  
 

Upon reaching round 5, so the 4-Man FFA, you should get the equivalent of the 7-Rounds Trials wins.  
 

To get Flawless you need to win this round. And go up against the last guardian on a 1-1 to claim the prize.  
 

The numbers above are up for debate. This idea centres around the idea of small short engagements and thinking outside the box.   
 

Let me know what you think. Your ideas, improvements and lets use this as a base for a healthy discussion.  
 

TL;DR: Fight 6-Rounds in a FFA. Reach Kills to qualify for next round. Last round 1-1"
1,Confession of a casual player,"Hi,

This is probably my second post on Reddit in my life. It won't be an outpouring of grief for the game, or a question for the community. Simply a reflection after a conversation with a fellow member of the clan I play in. Well, he recently said that until there is a new Grand Master level in the game, he doesn't really have much to do (he has 1330+ Light). As a matter of fact I've been seeing him almost non-stop in the game, while I, crushed by real life duties, could afford to play an hour or two a week (usually every other day) and a bit longer on weekends. And you know what, every time I turn the game on I'm glad I still have so much to do! 

I'm a casual gamer, and I'm proud of it. I don't speed run the game, I don't read tutorials on how to max out a character fastest or find the best loadout. I discover most secrets on my own or bump into them by accident. OK, if I get blocked somewhere I use the Internet or I use it when someone on Twitter e.g. advises me to buy a particular mod from Banshee. Fact, I play mostly PvE but thanks to that I don't get annoyed like that guy who complains about PvP balance. I'm lucky to belong to a clan that will take me on a raid from time to time. I treat it as a supplement to the joy of discovering more lore entries from the open world. I still have my inventory plenty of quests. I don't want to tell anyone how to play, or which way to consume the game is better. **In fact, I guess I want to thank Bungie for making a game that allows both just casual and hardcore gamers to enjoy** (as long as they don't start complaining about the lack of challenge that is ;)).

What do you guys think?"

1,Man this cooldown on shatterdive feels like it’s gonna be a bummer,Don’t get me wrong. Shatterdive was annoying in pvp but not cause of the dive itself. It was just the radius it affected and the damage resist. Shatterdive as a movement tool is strictly vertical unless you worldine skate which is a niche thing that’s not even viable in most activities. I’m glad it’s getting the no damage reduction. I’m glad it’s getting a radius nerf. But the cooldown feels like it will only be frustrating as it doesn’t even have 2 charges supposedly.

1,"Considering champions are an integral part of destiny gameplay mechanics, we should be having more freedom with champion mods usage. Also include a tutorial in first light campaign for new players.[MORE SUGGESTIONS IN POST]","So champions have been a an integral part of destiny gameplay for more than a year. Earlier they were in endgame activites but now they are almost everywhere. With main seasonal activities having them as integral part. Upcoming master raids version will also have them in abundance. Extotic quest also have them even in normal version. I would like to suggest few suggestions for upcoming seasons.                     
                      
1) A tutorial SHOULD be mandatory for new players in the quest line of Shaw han or anywhere in between. It should tell people how to stun a champion. Include minor things also like when champion is glowing you cannot stun them etc.                                  
2) We should have more accessibility of choosing weapons when it comes to stun champions. UNLOCK all mods automatically whenever we get the new seasonal artifact. Special champion mods for e.g sniper rifle anti barrier can be gated behind XP progression.                                      
3) More DIVERSITY of weapons type should be included. This season sniper rifle anto barrier is straight up my favorite mod. I can DPS AND STUN with same weapon. If these mods are locked with primary weapons only, it becomes difficult sometimes to run solo activities with champions in them.                                 
5) The above problem can also be solved by including more and more EXOTIC WEAPONS with intrinsic perks (e.g erainas vow, leviathan breath, devils ruin etc) for stunning champions. Previously issued exotics which are underused can be given such perks via catalyst or via addition of intrinsic perk. This will help players in seasons where their favorite weapon type don't have seasonal mods. Some examples for such weapons will be giving antibarrier to Arbalest, overload on 1K Voices etc.                              
6) Try not to lock down element specific abilities associated champion mods. For e.g meele ability of any element will stun unstoppable should be the mod. Charge them with more energy and make them permanent mods.                             
These are few of my suggestion more are welcome in post."

I love mechanics that require multiple people at the same time, and while you and your mates are doing one job the rest of your team isn’t just “shredding ads” they’re in fucking portals doing their own job, or shooting eyes etc it’s cool to see and I want more.

1,"Gambit is one of the, if not THE, most miserable experiences I’ve had playing this game","Speaking as someone who grinded out Gambit to reset their infamy this week, Gambit is tied with Trials as the worst game mode currently in Destiny. An absolutely miserable time for anyone who isn’t in a four stack, Gambit’s problems include:

* Playing on the same four maps because there hasn’t been a new map since season six and the others got put into the DCV.
* Power ammo still swinging games to a ridiculous degree. As much fun as it is getting repeatedly killed by Xenophage/Eyes of Tomorrow/Truth spamming invaders, it’s not.
* Power ammo not dropping for an entire match for some players and dropping frequently for others.
* The team that pulls ahead even for a moment wins the match most of the time as they can spam invasions and absolutely nuke their boss (especially with swords and the new titan chest piece), regardless of the progress of the other team. 
* Solo’s being queued against three and four stacks.
* Motes still being buggy when you pick them up off the ground. (There seems to be a new issue where motes fly into the air and back down again or just get stuck under the ground? Not sure if it’s just me.)
* Drop rates of the weapons still being low. I played around 25 or so games and received the fusion rifle twice and didn’t get the hand cannon at all. 

Any improvements Prime made to the game mode have not been carried over to this current iteration of Gambit. And given that there was zero mention of Gambit in the State of the Game TWAB, I can’t believe that Bungie is currently happy with how the game mode is currently playing out. Please can we get some improvements to it so something considered a core activity is actually bearable to play?"
1,Can the Aeon Exotics drop from Legendary Lost Sectors?,"This is going to be a bit of anecdotal evidence, but I just want to make sure nothing is bugged. I've run the LLS every day that it has been Arms for multiple exotic drop runs. I've gotten multiples of literally every other exotic arms, but haven't gotten one Aeon yet. I've been running these on my Titan.

It seems like a bit of a ranty question, but with the exotics getting their rework this season, I just want to make sure they aren't bugged or anything and that I'm not wasting my time.

Can any fellow crayon eaters confirm they've had these arms drop for them this season?"

I've even uninstalled and reinstalled Destiny 2, but even that hasn't worked. This problem only started to happen yesterday, and any fixes would be greatly appreciated."
1,So all of the new/newish exotic armor is locked behind high level lost sectors,"Is it also locked behind ""solo completion"", or is that just to increase the drop rate? I only just completed my first solo run of one of these and christ I miss random exotic world drops."
1,Playlist Specific Drop Rates need a buff,"Friendly reminder that this definitley has to be addressed.

The only playlists I really grind are PvP and now due to the BD Gambit and it really is a travesty.

From what I heard I might even have slightly over average luck with the Bottom Dollar but getting 3 (!) Over TWO infamy resets with a lot wins (hence not the largest amount of games needed for this but still a damn high amount) is an absolute joke.

Frozen Orbit is not much different. Yes this is a problem, specifically because the incredibly large perk pool (while beneficial in terms of variability) means the already incredibly low drop rate drops to basically zero for a specific roll. 

If you thought grinding for Spare Rations was bad, this is a whole new level, at least mathematically.

So, Bungie. Increase drop rates. Simple. It will still take a long while to get a roll you want but for casual players it is nigh impossible to get a decent kind of roll at the moment (and based on my hour account I would not consider myself casual)."
1,K1Crew Quarters - Master Lost Sector,"Just finished a few runs of this and wanted to pass some helpful hints.  I was able to get my Necrotic Grips finally, so that was awesome!

My loadout was Primary bow (Overload), Polaris Lance (Shield Pierce) and Tomorrow's Answer (Void)

Top Tree Voidwalker w/ Contraverse Hold (for Overloaded grenade)

Place an Arc Resistance on your chest piece, it'll help.  All void damage is increased, hence all the void. The splash damage from PL and from killing exploding shanks can proc Wrath of Rasputin, to get some warmind cells.

Overloaded Champions - Stun them with bow, throw overloaded nade on them, continue to shoot them with bow shots at a distance, sidestepping from out of cover and back again with shots to avoid the barrage of fire, and they will not move or regenerate their health.  If you want to, you can finish them off with the rocket launcher. The Polaris Lance made for never running out of ammo on crit shots, and worked especially well to break the shields on all the shanks and to take out the Shielded Servitors.

Main Boss shank, Polaris Lance is great for whittling down until you spawn the next champion, cycle overloaded nades, rocket launcher and Nova Bomb.

I just took my time, slow and steady to kill everything, was able to do my few runs in about 20 mins each, with only a death or two before the timer went out because I was pushing myself.  I was at 1328 light, but I believe this build could help anyone that's a bit behind on light as well.

Good Luck Guardians and may your exotic drop the first time!

(Also I heard if you go in with a full inventory of engrams that any Lost Sector exotic could drop, so if you haven't gotten the Chest or Helmet then there's a chance that will go to your Postmaster instead.)"

1,Master Lost Sector Rewards,"Hey all, was thinking about this for a few days. I ran the Master Lost Sector Exodus Garden 2A over in the Cosmodrome when it was in rotation and I ran about 4-5 times with no rewards at the end. I know killing Champions gives a better drop rate for loot at the end in general, but to have a few flawless runs as well as time ran under the 15 minute mark I thought maybe something was off. 

I've heard varying opinions on what the drop chance just not being great (whether it being exotics, or any rewards in general) but I was wondering if me maining my Warlock \*potentially\* has something to do with it?

What I mean is I main Warlock, so I have all of his Exotics and the like. Is it possible that the drop chance may taper off because of the amount of things done with my Warlock? Or am I overthinking and just having bad runs with loot? I'm really trying to armor grind for stats now that I know what I'm looking for, and I thought its best to go for Heads and Arms since typically that's what I use in terms of exotics, but as it stands those flawless runs (knowing full well that Flawless doesn't really factor into loot at the end) haven't yielded anything.

So....thoughts?"
1,The new exotic chests drop from nightfalls once you’ve grabbed a roll from the lost sectors,"Not sure if this is known, but once you’ve had the new exotics drop once, you can get them to drop from other places than just the legend/master lost sectors. I found this earlier in the season when I got a couple more masks of bakris from the NF, but had assumed it was only the previous season’s ones that were added to the pool. This weekend though, I got 3 drops of omnioculus from the nightfall. So if you’re searching for a better roll, you don’t have to just grind the lost sectors."
1,Are there any warlocks that could tel me which eververs set looks the best? Plus do you ever think they’ll bring back any of the season pass armours from past seasons or are they gone forever?,"I Hardly ever buy silver but I got a bit leftover after buying the season pass so I figured might as well get an armour set. Thing is I haven’t got a clue which to go for, most of them look kinda basic or silly, the luxe set looks good as well as the cormorant set, but I’m not sure so I’d love if anyone’s got any advise.                                                 Also I’ve been wondering, are the armour ornaments earned from the previous seasons season pass gonna come back? I’ve been playing on Titan for a bit so missed some of the armours in the past seasons, and it’s shame cause even though season of the hunt was pretty lame the season pass armour for the warlocks was dope."
1,Vanguard Rocket,Does it only drop from playlists or can I choose LoS from the EDZ director and speedrun it?
1,Here is how PvP feels for a lower skilled player,"Speaking about Control like playlists, the system always matches players like this:

*2 top players, 2 mid players, 2 low players on each side.*

The problem now for lower skilled players like me is, the lower skilled players always remain the lower skilled players. The system never matches a game where lower skilled players also could be the top players. It's a system that doesn't adapt. 2 Diamond, 2 plat/gold, 2 bronze/silver players. Always.  And the team that has the better 2 top players wins the game. The other players aren't that important. If you win a game as a lower player or not really is not that important. The experience is always bad. We always feel like fodder for the top players. That's the reason we are in that match. 

It's like you and your homies from the neighborhood go out to play a bit Basketball but as opponents you don't get some guys from the next neighborhood but you always face a NBA team. Always. Really, always! For some time you go out and try to compete with them. You hear tips about beeing good from good players(like Ascendent Nomad) but in the end you always have to face LeBron. And LeBron is super motivated and plays like it's the final game to win the cup. Needless to say that at some point 99% of the guys stop playing because it's no fun.

And the only answer to this is to get matched with players in your skill range. I mean i get that for top players this also means there won't be any lambs that they can slaughter. But honestly it's the only way to get more players into PvP. I'm in a 9 man raidgroup and i am the only one left playing pvp. This group was active and had fun as SBMM was active. Now nobody plays.

It's different for comp. I don't win every game there but 99% of the games i get some kills and have the feel as if i was part of the game in a positive way.

I know it isn't the solution to all problems and it doesn't make you a pvp god. Things like game sense, map knowledge, builds for pvp are still very important but with players in your range you have some positive success vibes now and then.  

I really hope this gets some attention even though what i basically say is to bring back SBMM. I feel it's the only way to get back some players."

1,Let XUR sell an Exotic Cipher quest if you've already turned in one this week,"Title. 

It's so annoying, yesterday I've spent over 6 hours farming DSC for spoils to get Anarchy (I've recently returned to the game, that's why I don't have it). Now everything is gated behind Xurs next arrival, because I've turned in an Exotic Cipher quest this week and bough Izanagi. 

Atleast make it so that I can pickup the quest but can't turn it in this week, because now I have to wait until Friday to start grinding for it, instead of doing it throughout the week while I'm doing other activities. By friday I'll have everything completed on my characters and I'll have to force myself through content that won't reward me anything and is easy as hell (strikes). 

Other ideas are welcome too, but this gating for Exotic Ciphers should be changed honestly. I don't  want to get 10 Exotic Ciphers per week, but let us get the quest so we can complete it during the week."

1,Every now and then I take a trip over to r/readdeadonline to make me feel better about this game and its developer,"I know a lot of people talk about the salt on this subreddit but, holy cowboy does it pale in comparison to the poor souls who play red dead online. I'll occasionally stop by the subreddit and see their cries for more meaningful content while getting 1% of the feedback from Rockstar in comparison to what we get from bungie. I feel for them but it makes Bungie look so much better in comparison. I'm not saying our complaints aren't valid, quite the opposite. They are, because we have a developer who listens. To also be fair to Rockstar I have no idea how their engine works in comparison to Destiny 2, but from what I am hearing about their next game update, their community doesn't sound very happy. 

It also makes me happy knowing that Bungie has made a multiplayer experience that really give players a chance to grief others, because boy is RDO one of the most toxic multiplayer experiences out there. In Destiny 2 for the most part we are all in it together even though we might squabble over nerfs, fotl armor sets, and other things. In RDO you are in constant fear of running into other players because you never know how sadistic they might be.

Shoot, RDO got sooo salty that they as a community dressed up as clowns in game as a protest against Rockstar's lack of communication and care to the game."
1,Best Hunter GM build?,"So I’ve been putting together multiple builds to get ready for grandmaster nightfalls, and i’m debating whether farming another aeon swift is worth it? also what builds would you guys recommend for hunters in gms?"
1,"Those of you who don’t pay attention to in game story, Why?","Been playing this game for a few years and I’m infatuated with the lore and story, but all my friends don’t even listen to the dialogue or cutscenes and they won’t give me a clear answer as to why. 
I just want to know why people voluntarily skip out on what is, (at the moment at least) a stellar storyline, that contributes massively to the identity of this game."

1,Bow mods are FAR to expensive,"currently bows one of the most unused weapons in the game and yet have rather expensive mods, only being outdone by handcannon, 

even some special weapon mods cost less such as fusion and shotgun targeting.

this is silly in my mind, if bows where ever present and performing like an handcannon within pvp and smgs in PvE, i would understand expensive mods.

but with the 1 in 100 chance of seeing a wild bow in a PvP match, compared to the 100% chance of seeing an shotgun and handcannon. fair to say they arent even in the same tournament

Handcannon are at the Olympics whilst bows are in the school sponsored little leagues game.

and as a bow guy this hurts to say, but they arnt the best.

the ONLY reason i think bungie would leave them as expensive as they are is leviathans breath, which from my experience is as rare as hens teeth, it exists but rare as hell. and even then exotics are meant to be the exception to the rule NOT the rule it's self

i honestly think bow mods should be equal to pulse rifle mods in cost. cheaper then the meta but still not 1 energy point"

1,Emote idea,"For the lore in the Thin Line hand cannon, it reads as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you forget which side you're on.

&amp;#x200B;

Your Ghost makes a list of the things he wishes he could say to you.

""Talk to me about how you feel.""

""I wish we would go home.""

""You're on a rampage, and I'm not comfortable with it.""

""I don't think this is why the Traveler chose you.""

""You know I'll never leave you, right?""

""But sometimes… I don't like the look in your eyes.""

Every day, the list grows longer.

""I'm here. I'm still here.""

""Are you still here?""

""I don't want to lose you to this.""

""I love you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share that time with you all. Proper Load-outs are always essential....this was not one of them.

What was your load for a solo battleground match? 

https://youtu.be/tf-0XBAyU1I"
1,Can we get more disruption exotics,"currently there is only 1 exotic weapon capable of stunning an overload champion, divinity.

where as there is 2 for the others,

now I'm NOT wanted every exotic to come with an champion mod, nor most new exotics to come with one, but i do want more choice exotic wise for champions

i feel that they should be limited in number and BASED around the mod to an descent degree, prime example divinity

and with a descent amount of weapons missing catalysts i think an cool idea would be the introduction of champion mods as an part of the catalyst, not the WHOLE catalyst

example;

two tailed fox; disruption/overload champion,

* currently lacking an catalyst as well as having weird [Interactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/m4ho3c/two_tailed_fox_an_d_its_weird_overload_interaction/) with the overload champions, this would be awesome"

1,"Bungie, I saw a interview where you guys said Forsaken might be sunset because it's confusing that Uldren was bad and is now good. It's really not. And if it WAS, issues like this are better solved with a Haunted style ""What you missed in D2"" cutscene covering past rare events when starting.",[removed]
1,More uses for champion mods OUTSIDE of champions?,"This was originally gonna be a reply to a comment on a thread, but it started getting so long winded I figured I'd just post it separately. 

I was thinking about the (very common) question about seasonal mods and how they could/should be implemented in the future. A lot of people (myself included) think that they should be passive bonuses that you unlock as you level up, and NOT mods that take away from your build potential.
This would still allow weapons like the lament feel cool since it would always be anti barrier, but still allow for other seasons to have a different effect for swords in general. 

The problem with that is currently there's very little use for the mods outside of champions. There are plenty of mechanical uses, such as getting through taken vandal bubbles, but they don't really do anything with that info.
(My square brain only put two and two together when I was playing the hawkmoon mission and was wondering why my night watch was still hitting the vandals)

So what if they could just start designing enemy encounters and variations around having these intrinsic anti champion effects? 

Imagine levels with high taken vandal/phalanx density during a season where anti barrier is on autos or lmgs, allowing you to cut through them if you bring the right guns. Or an encounter where enemies are set to use abilities much more frequently, requiring you to pack an overload weapon to give yourself a fighting chance!

You could even have the encounters stay the same in different activities throughout the year, which would make for interesting combos as the seasonal upgrades change.

Who knows, maybe they could give the mods more utility outside of combat. Like having a switch behind a barrier that you have to shoot through, or a terminal that you need to overload. 

I just think they really aren't fully taking advantage of the mods right now, here's to hoping we'll see more flexibility and fun with them in the future."
1,Invader load outs,"I’m grinding the Dredgen title but an not sure what loadout works best, any suggestions. I don’t not have any raid exotics."
1,BULLSHIT!!!,"Dude, Bungie this gettin fucking ridiculous right now, 40 Master Lost Sectors clears &amp; 5 of those clears I got exotics but the rest was nothing but legendary after legendary.

1,I feel like Titans need more projectile supers,"As a titan main it kinda feels like there is only one super that is useful in endgame PVE content (which is bubble). I know that you can use Phoenix cradle and use bottom tree sunbreaker or use thunder crash but I feel that Titans can do way more than punch REALLY HARD. Especially when most titan supers are melee focused like the entirety of the striker subclass and behemoth. And honestly I want something new. (Sorry for going on a tangent there) 

Tl:dr  I just want to use a super that doesn’t involve me getting stomped all the way to Brazil when I try to get close to a boss or being the bubble bitch that can only do support.(give titan some DPS capabilities)

Since witch queen is probably gonna give us a darkness subclass I propose that they should give us Titans the destiny equivalent of a Spartan laser with 3 shots and piercing capabilities (kinda like sleeper simulant) from halo or maybe a hive chitin crossbow/ballista.

The fragments for the Spartan laser could be that you get more 2 shots at the cost of a 15% super damage decrease and a -5 recovery or maybe add an effect like cauterize from D1 that jumpstarts your health regeneration.

And for the crossbow or ballista make the hive chitin create week spots on the enemy or make the chitin shatter and have a blast radius."
1,"The exotic quest and weekly challenges have been really cool. I wish there was more endgame but if this is how seasons are, I can live with that.","I think the exotic quest has been amazing. I hope it evolved a bit more, as I have reason to believe it will. I really don't care for the seasonal activity model, but as far as those to, this has been the best one since managerie. I wish there was more of a focus on endgame. However, if this is the model that we get, it feels much better than last year at this time."

1,How To Fix The Stasis Issue,"If everyone who hates stasis stopped using stasis, it wouldn’t be a problem. But I guess people hate the idea of playing at a disadvantage for the greater good of PvP, if that means you occasionally lose to babies. Personally speaking, I haven’t touched stasis in PvP for a long time now, and I’ve still been able to play to the same level. So if you hate stasis, you really can’t justify using it on the grounds of competing with others, because in most circumstances, you’ll be fine.

Rant over."
1,FIX THE DAMN PINNACLES,"I thought they were supposed to drop 1-2 above your overall power level (not including artifact) I keep getting drops at 1308 while my overall is 1308, 4 of my drops this week have been at my current level, this is extremely frustrating and needs to be fixed as this keeps happening week after week."
1,Bungie doesn’t understand “difficulty”,"Hello, this is my first time posting in the Destiny Reddit or in any destiny forum/group ever. First I want to apologize off the bat if you do not agree with what I am about to say, this is in my opinion something important to a lot of people, so please take the time to read it. I’d appreciate it.

So, I have been playing destiny 2 since launch. I will start by saying I am not someone who played D1 so maybe things were different back then, however a major complaint I have about D2 is difficulty. Or more so, the lack of difficulty. 

Playing any story missions in destiny that are part of a campaign, you would probably agree with me that it’s a cake walk. The same thing with vanguard strikes and such. While it is no fun to do something easy with no reward, I do not enjoy torture with little rewards either. 

Maybe this complaint is only mine alone but slapping “modifiers” on something and spawning in enemies that eat bullets. (The reason I say they eat bullets is something I will come back to.) It makes the activity an annoyance, something so hard to play simply because it’s a hassle to deal with.

 Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I don’t mind modifiers. I like them, I love the elemental burns, I enjoy champions, and some of these modifiers do provide difficulty to activities. As someone who plays master nightfalls almost daily this season, I can say that the modifiers in that activity specifically are not the problem. 

The area I feel there’s a problem is lost sectors. I just came out of over an hour of attempting the Master K1 lost sector on the moon for exotic arms, just to come out empty handed. The reason for this, I had a lot of failed attempts, and one successful attempt where I got a legendary engram from the end rewards? That doesn’t seem right but that’s a different issue. 

So, is this a rant about the lost sectors themselves? No, I think it’s great bungie put in an activity that has solo playability and value. The rant is about modifiers and champions within them. For example, arc burn, fine it’s manageable if you’re prepared. The champions are a different story.

For reference I am a 1329 Hunter with Max Mobility, Recovery, and high resilience. I have the stats to do these things which as why I said the burn modifiers aren’t a big deal. The big deal with when you spawn about 4-5 champions in one area on a solo activity. Once again I don’t think it’s impossible to beat those champions solo. It is with enough time which you don’t have in the lost sectors. But time isn’t the problem. It is the mods themselves.

Overload smg takes a whole clip to stun a champion. Unstoppable hand canons and pulse rifles have a ridiculous wait time just for the shot to hit and not stun the champion. Overload swords take around 5-6 hits. Anti barrier sniper takes a minimum 2 shots to destroy a barrier, and scout rifles take about 6. So after taking into account all these mods having obscure start up times and functionality, what do you do?

Personally I tried all those mods and well they’re mediocre if they can even do their job. But the one that is supremely terrible is overload bow. Almost every arrow says it’s overload yet it never seems to stun anything ever. But on the off chance it does, it’s not doing it again for eight years. Maybe this is all due to a cool down on champion stuns. If so, please take it out of the game. What is the point of giving players mods to stun champions if there’s a safe period for them to instantly heal before you can stun them again.

So dealing with that issue in and of itself is terrible but then mix that with mods like attrition and it just makes me want to uninstall the game. I really hope I don’t sound terrible and someone can agree with me. Like I said I just think mods need to be fixed, or the champion stun cool down needs to go altogether. Lastly I’d love if bungie put more time into making things difficult every week somehow without slamming on nine modifiers and calling it hard."
1,End-of-Season loot ideas,"Hammer of Proving - Exotic Aggressive Frame Sword There are only two aggressive frame swords, and both of them are sunset. And a hammer would be awesome to use as a heavy weapon. 

Personal War Beast - Exotic Sparrow
I chose to add this because D2's sparrows are lacking diversity when compared to D1's. We had those cool flashy sparrows with different sounds, designs and trails. 
Having a literal war beast as a sparrow also fits the cabal theme of the season, and the war beast is the only animal in the game, or at least the only thing resembling one.
If the season ""ends well"", it could probably be a gift from our beloved Caiatl. 

Exotic or Legendary armor: We had some cool cabal themed armor pieces in D1, like psion flayer capes for hunters and mau'ual's maulers for titans. It would be cool to have them at least as strike exclusive loot for Proving Grounds, the new strike.

Let me know in the comments what do you think about it and maybe write your ideas!"
1,Can we hide helmets even In combat please?,"I just want my awoken hunter to have a hood on without the helmet, my warlock without the triangle shaped head, my titan....well idk about that one. 


Can we also get the ability to remove the hoods off any cloak we please? I know it's possible because if you have the ""Helmet off"" option in the tower, all hoods are removed. Though I guess it wouldn't be fair to the titan and warlock class to not get an extra cosmetic option. Perhaps warlock cloaks could be un-buttened for a trench coat feel and titans can have a ""Hide shoulder pauldrons""? Lol."

It would be nice to have a new gambit map in view of the pyramid ship on the moon, in the remains of the crashed space station on Europa, or the plaguelands in the cosmodrome. Just something so it doesn't feel stale anymore."
1,"Bring back The Red War as a tutorial. It made for a Good, Natural tutorial for the game, with cool moments and free content for new players, and the biggest mistake of it's removal was the attempted replacments for it.","Ok so hear me out. The Red War was a good tutorial for the game. It had a upfront villain for people to get used to, it NATURALY taught players all about the game in it's parts, it provided some free content for new players to play, all of the people in it are (and probably will be for a long while) key players in the game so there will be no confusion of ""Why is X character different?"" ETC.  


And to be honest, it would make for a much, much better tutorial then New Light. It simply does not replace the amount of content and characters The Red War had. Noone likes Shaw Han Bungie. *NOONE.*  


The only confusing part could be ""Wait the Cabal attacked us why are we in alliance with them now?"" and you know how *that* can be solved? A SIMPLE BLEEDING CUTSCENE OF ""THE STORY OF DESTINY 2 SO FAR!"" Seriously, most of the issues Bungie posited can be solved with that. Hell, *you've been doing one per season since Dawn anyway*, just make it a bit longer to cover what we missed between Red War and now, and maybe do it in the Haunted/Eramis backstory cutsecene style to save money.  


TLDR: Bring back Red War as the start of the game. Rework it slightly to work with new changes and removed content EG make the missions on removed planets the only parts of those planets. Add a Haunted style ""The Story So Far"" cutscene when complete that summerizes the parts of Destiny 2 people missed, like why Cayde is dead, why Uldren is good now, why we are no longer in a war with the Cabal on Mars ETC. Noone likes Shaw Han."

1,Destiny 2 Discussion.,Hey everyone I added a discussion to my profile any input would be muchly appreciated.
1,Talk about Mods,What do you guys think would be a good way to make getting mods more viable besides wishing for just one that you want over months. I personally think there should be a way to grab any mod from collection for a price to unlock it forever so you dont have to waste months waiting for one mod from gunsmith to make life a little bit easier on Destiny 2.
1,[D2]Customizable weapon animations ( IDEA),"So, as you all know, destiny as a whole is a game that allows the players to modify pretty much everything about their experience, from armor, shading, sparrows and ships, exotics, and most important of all, guns 

The thing that brought this idea to mind, was when i loaded up in multiple zones and my character and equipment was loading in, so, when you shoot and reload the gun sounds and reloads like the base preset for that category of gun, i dont know if this happens to all weapons but i’ve had it happen to revolvers, shotguns and auto rifles

This made me think, if all weapons have the same base preset for sound and animations, but stats, and perks remain the same and the look and anim. are put on top, this could mean that any (for example) revolver could use any animation of that category ( except fan firing bc last word is the only one)

I dont think im the only one that uses certain guns for their animations and looks rather than meta stuff ( ace of spade’s reload) so this would be a BIG add to an already great player-defined experience

nor PvP or PvE will be affected by this change in any way, i think.

In short, being able to customize weapon animations would be a perfect addition to a game so deep on player customization. ( some guns dont apply, such as Dead man’s, top-breaking revolvers, etc) 

That made me think, there’s like no variation on pulse rifle anims. or snipers..mmm..

I’d love to hear what y’all think of this, yay or nay? Must have or nah?"

Why play when bungo will hand you everything??,"My fireteam and I worked our fucking asses off to obtain the Armory Forged Shell and the Hubris of Niobe emblem that it comes with several season ago. It’s something completely unique in the game that no one else could get if they didn’t do the mission. UNTIL NOW. I had a clan mate open a god damn Eververse Engram and it just handed him the Armory Forged Shell. Unbelievable bungo. No one should be getting that ghost shell if they didn’t earn it. And I have seen people getting the Sleeper catalyst from Adept NF farming. No one should be getting the old raid exotic catalysts for less than a GM NF completion. IYKYK, getting and completing the Sleeper catalyst was hard af. This is some BS. Nothing is worth working your ass off for in this game anymore. What is the point, if all I have to do is stop playing the game for a few months then bungo will just hand me everything I missed with little to ZERO effort???"
1,Add the Spoils of War system DSC has to GoS and LW as well,"It’s extremely draining to do GoS or LW when you only get 1-3 chances per week to get anything out of them, and even more draining when you’re trying to get a specific roll on a gun, only to get guns with the same unwanted perks, or no drops of that gun at all, multiple times week after week.

Really kills any desire to do be those raids every week when the same unwanted perk combos and guns drop every time. 

In my case, i’ve had dozens of Ancient Gospels drop with the exact same perks as the last drop, while other perks have dropped one or zero times. Almost feels like certain perks are weighted to drop more often, and it makes chasing desired rolls feel like a waste of time.

Also doesn’t help that there’s almost nothing special about these weapons aside from looks, and that they’re really no different performance-wise to other guns that can be acquired far more frequently through systems like umbral engrams.

Thanks to DSC’s spoils system, this isn’t as big of an issue, as you can directly pick which guns you want as a reward for completing encounters. Because of this and because of the fact that spoils drop on repeat completions of DSC, the raid’s weapons feel far more enticing to go after."

1,Can we speed up the inventory load time?,"The time it takes to pull up the inventory menu in gameplay is too long. This has bugged me since they made the switch in D1. I started playing shortly after D1 was released, and it was possible to open the menu and switch up your loadout before you respawned in Crucible. Add it stands today, the menu takes 3-4 seconds to load up. Does anyone else feel like it takes entirely too long to pull up the inventory screen?"
1,Know What To Do,"Know what to do, means, know what to do.

I’m fed up of joining raid groups on the Destiny raid groups through my app that title themselves as “KWTD” when they have 2 to 4 members who have no idea what they’re doing.

I end up leading this group through the entire raid, something I usually enjoy, but other experienced members who have also been duped eventually leave after the 2nd to 3 hour, which leaves me as the new leader of this group of newbies in the position of finding new people to join us near to the end of the raid (which no one wants to do) 

From the start usually I have to painstakingly lead them through every detail as people join and leave, because they’re frustrated that newbies don’t immediately know how to do a raid. 

I hate, HATE! “KWTD” posts when the host has a party of people who don’t know what to do, and then are terrible at telling those people what to do. It is FALSE ADVERTISING!!! Don’t do it, you scum bags!

I love being a sherpa, but every now and then, I want to join a party of people who KWTD.

Ain’t too much to ask is it. F**k."
1,D2 Y1,"I wish we could back to those times, no people crutching on felwinters or shotguns as a whole, every PVP match is ""Run with shotguns"" seems like people doesnt know what a primary weapon is anymore, its so annoying because, unless you run Felwinter or astral or even Bastion, you are pretty much screwed because of Destiny small map designs, Its not even fun watching a hunter kill your entire team with a shotgun and still had bullets to run around and kill more.  


Please bungie give us the D2 y1 meta back, fuck shotguns and before ""Just backpedal bro!"", yeah with the stupid design Bungie put in their maps is almost futile since you either back imto a wall or back into a damn random box, while a titan just slides right at you with wards on, since the start of this season and Beyond light as a whole, i havent seen a damn sniper in PVP only shotguns, and we are talking Console PVP.  


At this point you are forced to go wiht Felwinters, becuase even slug shotguns get outmatched, since the maps are so small you are practicably next to your enemy for the most part"

But he said scavenger mods do stack. Was he wrong? I didn’t see anything in the mod descriptor a la nightmare breaker mods saying “more copies of this mod do/don’t increase effectiveness”. 

Got me wondering... have I been noobing it up in other ways too? Ashes to ashes? Absolution? Reload speed? Targeting?  Etc...

1,12 mans raid haters/ non teachers,"So I’ve don’t quite a few raids in the past week or two, some for the first time, most I’ve done parts but not all of, and I’ve watched videos on how to do all of them. Just wanna say THANK YOU to all the guardians who actually explain what’s going on even when you have extra fire team members, and say ‘what the hell!?’ to the people I’ve played with who refuse to explain what’s happening and wasting everyone’s time in the process. Literally heard “if you are running a 12 man then you should already know what to do” 
NO. The reason I actually had confidence to join this raid on LFG was the fact I thought I wouldn’t mess it up for everyone, not that I already knew how to do it!"

1,Conflicts on Morality of 3rd Person Peeking,"A bit of a AITA post, but this problem is heavily related to Destiny and I don't know where else to put it.  


Background: Me and 3 of my friends were playing Destiny 2 and had just completed a Nightfall. One suggested Private Rumble and we agreed to it. I was using Adored to train sniping as I was warming up for Trials.  


We played like normal rumble, using different loadouts and having fun. This one guy, who I will can Person X, was on 10 frames, but we continued playing as he could still hit his shots and actually move.  


I had cornered Person X, with his back to the wall and only a piece of cover standing between us. I threw a grenade, misdirected him with Gemini, and went in for the kill. Only then I noticed he was using a sword to 3rd person peek, and killed me with Felwinters. I got mad at him using 3rd person peeking, and proceeded to hunt him down until the match ended in 1 minute. I explained to him what I thought of 3-peeking, which was that it was disgusting to use, unfair to the rest of us playing in 1st person and that I was disappointed. I left, turned off my computer and cooled my head.  


However, a few friends of mine have said my reaction was unnecessary and they saw nothing wrong with using a sword, because anyone could do it. I personally find it against the sportsmanship of 1st person shooters, but now I'm not so sure if I should have cracked down that hard on Person X.   


Should I have let him be, or was my reaction actually justifiable? Help me reddit."
1,The Presage final boss needs to have a checkpoint.,"At the device of posts on this subreddit I decided to give the Presage mission a try solo since lots of people here were recommending that. Got through the ship, struggled with the hanger section a bit but made it to the boss. I died twice at the boss when he was at less than 1/3 hp (among some other earlier deaths). Its been 3 hours, its late, and now Ive got to sleep which means I have to do the entire ship and survival section again. Oh and one of my deaths was cause I got physics'd into a wall and took damage."
1,Bad Anti Aliasing,"this could just be an issue caused by how much of a fossil my ps4 is but has anyone else noticed how bad the anti aliasing in this game can be? usually its fine but when theres volumetric light in almost any environment, viewing objects within the environment at a distance looks like a bunch of ps1 objects in a ps5 environment. super nit picky and honestly doesn't matter that much but im still curious if anyone else has this issue"

1,My first ever D2 raid clear was a 3-hour 10-person Garden of Salvation Divinity run,"It started out as a 12-person fireteam that had me smiling ear to ear seeing so many Guardians onscreen to ending with 10 people having to 3-phase the Sanctified Mind. (I know.)

Regardless, shout-out to xMattxAshx, xMRS_DIVAx, and their community for making it happen for this solo player who has logged many hours into this game.

I’m so happy to have experienced the hilarity and chaos of being in a 6+ person fireteam before it gets patched."
1,"Reissue all the gear from planetary vendors with random rolls, and allow the armor to acquired with random rolls.","Also bungie, pay attention to Kujay’s videos.

1,Deep Stone Lullaby simultaneously soothes and aggravates my tinnitus,"It’s an unbelievable piece of music and WHILE I’m listening to it I love it, but then when it ends, I still have the high pitched part ringing in my ears. Then I make that ringing sound like Deep Stone Lullaby, and then I want to do Deep Stone Crypt, which means I want to play Destiny...

Wait a second, Bungie did you just monetize tinnitus?"
1,I got a thing....,"Was helping a clanmate get caught up - he wanted Hawkmoon. This one dropped for me.

1,Mods need a significant rework in more ways than one,"The mod system is currently both bloated and frustrating for new players, returning players, and even for those who possess most/all the mods. I played a friends account yesterday from 1100 to 1250 in comp and was shocked that you dont even have access to the +10 mobility, recovery etc as a new player. Only the +5s. I have a few suggestions that I think would make mods much more user friendly all around.

1. Remove all mod stacking. One of each mod works, that's it. Prevents issues with mods being too good and working in unintended ways. Possible exception can be made for combat style mods that were made the the intention of being stacked. 

2. Consolidate mod types to make creating our loadouts easier. By this i mean instead of 12+ of each finder, targeting, etc mod, they be consolidated based on ammo type. Primary weapon targeting, energy ammo finder, heavy weapon dexterity. You get the idea. Having 3 for each type instead of 12+ makes finding the one you want easier, and also means you dont have to switch unflinching SMG to unflinching pulse when going from pve to crucible. I promise it will be ok if hand cannon targeting costs less energy. Potential issues here: Arbalest, special vs heavy GLs, heavy ammo snipers+tractor cannon, maybe others. I dont know the best solution for these outliers.

3. Disabled all combat style mods in crucible. If its possible, disable them from working in the pvp component of gambit.

4. Disable aeon glove mods in gambit

5. MAKE ALL MODS EXCEPT COMBAT STYLE MODS AVAILABLE FOR NEW PLAYERS UPON CHARACTER CREATION. These should not be locked behind a playwall. Traction on console vs not having Traction is a very significant difference. Not being able to slap +10 mobility on w new character is ridiculous. At the very least, unlock all these mods once a new/returning player hits the current seasons LL soft cap.

6. Rework how banshee sells mods. Since weapon mods and the non combat style mods should be auto unlocks, all that should remain are cwl/warmind mods for now.. And maybe black armory weapon mods if you feel like holding those back. Banshee should sell 1 random mod from this pool every day. Banshee should have a quest that rewards you 1 random mod from this pool every day. Duplicate mods auto dismantle into 2 mod components. Quest costs 10 mod components and can be done once a day.

7. Weapons (including exotics) should gain an additional mod slot and anti champion mods should be moved back to weapons. All primary weapons should have access to anti barrier every season at the very least, though I believe they should have access to all champion mods every season, while special/heavies can stay on seasonal rotation.

8. Consolidate ghost mods. There are too many. Using the masterwork mods as an example, a good first step is to combine the 3 for each activity into one mod to get down to 5."
1,What made you pick up Destiny?,"I picked up D1 because I remember seeing screen grabs of Thorn and wondering why it looked like such an interesting weapon, fast forward a couple years and I’ve sunk thousands of hours into a game, and it all started with Thorn."
1,Build title: Wind of Niflheim,"A build I was working on recently, which has a lot under the hood for both solo and fireteam play.   
**Note: This only works in PvE.**

&amp;#x200B;

Aspects: 

**Grim Harvest,** 

* Dodging slow enemy targets. 

**Winter's Shroud**  

* Defeating slowed/frozen targets drops crystals that grant melee energy that can be picked up by you or your allies.

&amp;#x200B;

Fragments: 

**Whisper of Impetus:** 

* Damaging targets with a Stasis melee reloads stowed weapons, grants boost to weapon ready speed 

**Whisper of Fractures:**

* your melee energy recharges faster when you are near two or more combatants

**Whisper of Refraction:**

* Defeating slowed or frozen targets grants you class ability energy

&amp;#x200B;

From these Aspects and Fragments alone I can almost grant myself a full charge with quicker cooldown, and give myself class ability from killing targets near me. No Shatterdive because it's just a hinderance to the concept. 

For armor, I'll give more detail as to show how it works.

**Helm:** 

Hands On x2.

* Gain bonus Super energy on melee kills

Chosen of the Warmind

* Collecting or destroying a Warmind Cell creates a concussive blast that pushes enemies away.

&amp;#x200B;

Arms:

Speedball.

* Increases Grenade throw distance

Momentum Transfer

* Causing damage with a grenade reduces your melee cooldown

Warmind's Light.

* Become charged with Light by collecting a Warmind Cell

&amp;#x200B;

Chest (exotic: The Sixth Coyote)

Arc Resistance x2.

* Reduces incoming Arc damage from combatants

Sheltering Energy.

* Collecting a Warmind Cell grants you an overshield

&amp;#x200B;

Legs:

Innervation.

* Reduces grenade cooldown each time you pick up an orb of Power

Recuperation

* Replenishes health each time you pick up an orb of Power

Argent Ordnance

* While charged with Light, readying or firing a rocket launcher grants it increased damage or reload speed. Damaging a combatant with a rocket consumes one stack of Charged with Light.

&amp;#x200B;

Cloak:

Glacial Inheritance.

* Defeating targets with your Stasis Super refunds energy

Elemental Light.

* Defeating a combatant with your super spawns an elemental well that matches your subclass type. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons: Monte Carlo, IKELOS SG, Code Duello

TLDR: Throw shurikens, get super. Get kills with weapons, get melee, reload stowed weapons, get overshield."
1,Should I do the powerfuls before the pinnacles this upcoming weekly reset?,Im currently at 1295 and this Tuesday's powerful gear should get me to 1300. Should I get to 1300 then do the pinnacles?
1,Eyes of Tomorrow...I’m Doing This for Luck,"I know it’s posted all the time but never by me. I have 51 loot clears of DSC, 42-45 of which are full raid clears, no eyes. My clan leader completed it tonight for her first ever clear (we have 5 clans in total, we are big) and wouldn’t you know it? Eyes. I’m fine. This is fine.

Some who have posted here for lucky soon after. I’m hoping Tuesday is my day, finally. I should have had the raid seal in early January."

1,Why TF does the dead man's tale not make a 'moo' noise,it has cows on it! It would be more accurate if it had a comically peaceful mooing noise to the hawk shriek
1,Unable to get the hawkmoon quest?,"So I know that the only way to access that quest in Season 13 is to have purchased the BL deluxe edition. I'm game sharing on Xbox with my dad, who bought the deluxe edition, and even when I play on that platform I am unable to access it. I have access to all of the other deluxe rewards so I know it registers that version on my account. I've done the intro to season 12 on two different characters now, and neither allow me to continue the quests after I talk to spider and all that jazz happens. It doesn't appear in the exotic quest kiosk either. Any tips on how I can get my favorite D1 gun back?"
1,Please reconsider the sunsetting of a few *ritual* weapons;,"Namely the “**Komodo 4FR**”, “**Buzzard**”, “**Edgewise**”, and “**Exit Strategy**” since there’s an argument to be made about how powerful the others are compared to Bungie’s weapon roll paradigm shift plus the availability of select perks. 

(There’s reload + damage perk on “Randy’s Throwing Knife” and overflow on “Python”.)

As it stands, the rolls on these ritual weapons are either matched or overcome by other options:

**Exit Strategy** competes with the new battlegrounds smg “Extraordinary Rendition” in the kinetic slot. The battlegrounds smg simply has better base stats and better available perks. Having Exit Strategy not be power-locked would simply be another option that’s statically-rolled, which wouldn’t hurt.

**Komodo 4FR** is a linear fusion rifle, and has no other competition really because... well... near nobody uses them. It has solid perks that lend more to PvP, and it’s difficult to even say it has competition with how dead the weapon type is. Last season’s linear can roll the exact same perks, with even arguably better PvP perks.

**Edgewise** is the same archetype as the raid machine gun “Commemoration”, and can LITERALLY roll the same perk setup, but Commemoration is simply better because of its perks and base stats.

**Buzzard** is debatably kept dead, since no other kinetic or energy sidearms can roll fourth times the charm (afaik). It also has the fairly dead perk osmosis. Again, it’s simply another legendary option that could easily exist. (Cool model too might I add)

A shared theme is that all of these weapons are outclassed by their newer counterparts in almost every way. If anything, they’re just cool but wasted models if nothing is done by Bungie. They could exist in the kiosk as reliable but temporary statically-rolled replacements for their competition. It would add another option to each respective weapon type or slot with zero net negatives.

[  I just really want Komodo back, it was so nice, the Tarantula just can’t do it for me. :(. ]"

1,If we get more warmind weapons that can make cells one of them should be a kinetic grenade launcher,It would look really cool and would replace that slot missing for a lot of players with militia’s birthright and mountaintop both being sunset.
1,Caital out here with the big brain time,I just love how after reading the recent lore we find out caital wanted to negotiate a truce with guardians but knows others wont agree so what does she do she shows a force of power to keep up appearances of cabal strength and then feeds the people who oppose the truce/negotiations to us so we can kill them and when there dead and gone we actually negotiate. Caital has been a really good character..........please dont kill her bungie

1,Crest of alpha lupi and other random,"Since Crest sees very little play, what if the exotic allowed the titan to store extra charged with light orbs for the team, like after 10 stacks, you would send out pulse waves that would keep your fire team charged with light. This would allow fun builds in higher end content,  2 could run warmind builds or the new mods this season and wouldn't need taking charge or other mods to be charged with light? I'd also like the fast rez to come back for this piece?

(Correct me if I'm wrong) why don't we have a hawk swooping in tranmat effect, with the ca caw sound?

Next year for Crimson doubles....a sparrow with a side car!? That 2 can ride? Or a 2 person one, but the person in back has to sit backwards...cheesy yes, stupid yes.

A crucible Playlist equipment mayhem....no supers, abilities are normal, but you can equip 2 exotic weapons,  2 exotic armors?

Can we change the mini barricade on the titan? Maybe to a ""wedge shape ""( think snow plow) but this barricade could ""divert"" certain attacks to the side? 

Foe tracers...instead of randomly granting walhacks, what if they granted a version of true sight, but with footprints? Kinda like where your teammate in a super? Since you know hunters ""hunt""?

Darci...what if the person assistant actually after ADSing loaded the bullet needed for that champion?

Masterworking...
I think after armor is masterworked it should only cost 100 glimmer to swap mods,  depending on what I'm doing, crucible,gambit ,strikes, a raid...it can cost almost 10k swapping out mods, scavengers etc etc. Not everyone can get ""God rolled"" armor for ever element, and have a set for every game type....yes I know there's ways to get glimmer...but I think masterworked armor should have another ""perk"" vs just the 10 energy.

Master worked exotic armor...super expensive...yes golf balls aren't to hard to come by, but still it's alot of materials and time invested...maybe add us 2 energy to exotic masterworked armor? For total of 12? Most the good mods are 3 energy, plus scavengers are mostly 3, 
So legs could have grenade cool down, grenade launcher scavenger,rocker launcher scavenger, and taking charge on say stompees?

Silver for vault space...easy money maker for bungie...I'd gladly pay 500 silver for 200 more vault space? Especially since sunsetting is no more, I have some unique guns I'd still like to hold onto. Like my midnight coup with 10k kills on it.

New mods for guns...I know we are getting adept mods that do more, but for regular weapons...sprint grip, surrounded spec, radar tuner,radar booster....as far as I know aren't used....with rampage coming on fewer and fewer weapons I think its not used as much either....maybe a ""zoom mod"" to help with range on weapons with barrels?

Can raids, grandmaster nightfall, trials have a chance to drop fully masterworked gear? Used to from the pit? Either you like it....or get materials?

12 man events....I'm sure this has been talked about alot on how this could work etc. 
My ""idea"" once a month like IB there's a ""world invasion"" event 3 teams of 4 are broken up randomly from a fire team of 12....(Drifter/Osiris needs you to do something sketchy ) one team is put in an invasion, like Escalation protocol but there's champion's all 3 types, big enemies(like in ep)...the other 8 have to fight their way through to get to the team of 4 and hold ground do an objective. Every level would jump say 5 light points...if the whole team gets killed Drifter/Osiris calls you back and talks massive smack

1,The kill tracker system has been flawed for all of its existence and is in desperate need of a rework.,"Throughout the life of Destiny, Guardians have used kill trackers to show off their proficiency with their favorite guns. The way the system works is so overly complicated and there are some small QoL changes that could vastly improve user experience.

• **Exotics**
As it stands right now, only exotic weapons with a catalyst are eligible for a kill tracker. The problem is, not all exotic weapons have a catalyst (another problem for another day). Therefore, if your favorite exotic weapon just so happens to be lacking a catalyst, you’re out of luck. You just went on a week long gambit grind to get Malfeasance? Too bad, you can’t track your kills with your new gun. All exotic weapons should intrinsically be able to count your kills, even before you get a catalyst. These are the most rare and powerful weapons in the game, you deserve to be able to show your dedication to using them.

• **PvE and PvP trackers**
The separation of the regular kill tracker and the crucible kill tracker has always been unnecessarily complicated. While enemy kills and guardian kills should be tracked separately, the need to switch between trackers seems like a needless waste of time. Both trackers should be shown and tracking at the same time; there is no reason for it to be one or the other. 

• **Unlocking the tracker**
Right now, you have to upgrade your weapon to a certain masterwork level before you can begin to track kills. This is just another artificial roadblock that has been created for no reason. What if you had been using a gun for a long time but had never upgraded it? All of those kills will not be reflected once you do finally unlock the tracker. This means that the kill counter will not actually show the amount of enemies you have killed with that weapon, only the ones you killed after getting the tracker. This system doesn’t require a complete overhaul, as upgrading the weapon to see your kills is a fair enough trade, but it should be tweaked. If the gun automatically tracked your kills from the moment you picked it up, but only showed you that number once you upgrade it enough, then the kill count would be more accurate. Also, it would incentivize players to upgrade their weapons to see how many kills they have gotten with them.

Sorry for the long rant, this is just something that I’m really passionate about that I would love to see changed."

I do enjoy thinking of exotic and raid ideas though, so I thought it'd be cool to create an idea for a raid.

This is a raid idea for the Witch Queen expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: Our guardian, Shaxx, Eris, Drifter, and the Crow all began having headaches and hearing Savathun's voice. Our ghost manages to trace what's happening to an Ascendant portal, specifically a portal that's appeared at the Ahamkara bones near Shaxx. Our raid team launches in, and the first encounter begins.

First Encounter: The Labyrinth:

Upon launching in, the raid team is greeted by a massive doorway that leads to a large maze. You are able to jump on the walls of the maze, but the boss, Asher Mir, Taken Amalgam, will fire a big taken blast and kill them instantly. Our guardians will need to proceed carefully through the maze, because Taken Minotaurs are prowling the maze. If they see a guardian, they will heavily aggro them, which sucks, because any attack from the minotaurs will kill our guardian in a single blow. Guardians will have the choice of either trying to sneak past these minotaurs or fight them. Guardians will have to find 3 Radiolarian Infused Hive Larva scattered throughout the map. Radolarian Infused Hive Larva can be used as a trace rifle sort of weapon with infinite ammo, but they deal minimal damage to any enemy. The Larva deal massive damage to Asher's shield however. The main way of damaging Asher is grabbing the Larva and firing at his shields. If Asher's shield is damaged but not destroyed within 10 seconds, everyone wipes, so it's critical the fireteam coordinates and shoots him at the same time. Once his shield is down, the 3 guardians with the Larva get the Radiolarian Infused debuff, rendering them unable of firing the larva or dealing damage to Asher. The other 3 guardians do damage, before the maze reforms itself in a new configuration. The 3 guardians who don't have the debuff have to now run to their counterparts, pick up the Larva from them, and trigger another damage phase, while avoiding the minotaurs. When Asher's shield is broken, those with the debuff lose it, while those holding the Larva gain it. This process is repeated until Asher reaches a small portion of his health. At this point, Asher falls to the center of the maze, and the maze reforms to allow easy access to the center. Here, two platforms rise, one green, one red. Asher begs the guardians to kill him, and they have to vote. If it is a tie or a majority votes to spare Asher(Green), Asher regenerates and kills the team, wiping them. If all 6 vote to kill Asher, they are corrupted by the darkness and wipe. The only way to finish the encounter is for 1 or 2 guardians to vote to spare him, while the rest vote to kill him. The guardians who voted to save him get the debuff Heresy, while those who voted to kill him get the buff Worthy. Savathun manifests and kills Asher, before opening another portal for the guardians to go through. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the class item, boots, solar machine gun, and sidearm, and the exotic Warlock Gauntlets Asher Mir's Right Arm.

Second Encounter: Riven's Revenge

This is a jumping puzzle with vanishing platforms, similar to the ascendant challenges. Those with the Heresy debuff however have severely limited vision and would normally be unable to do the puzzle because they can't when the platforms are appearing or disappearing. It's then up to those with the Worthy buff to tell them when to and where to jump, guiding them through the puzzle. When they reach the end of the puzzle, those with the debuff will regain their vision. They will be on a large floating island, with columns of shriekers stretching upwards. Random shriekers will be glowing white, but this glow will only be visible to those with the Heresy debuff. Those with the debuff will start shooting the glowing shriekers. When the first shrieker is damaged, those with the debuff will begin to float upwards. If a shrieker that isn't glowing is shot, all the shriekers will aggro and make the encounter much harder. If those with the Heresy debuff reach the top of the Shrieker stack without killing every shrieker, the guardians wipe. Meanwhile, on the ground, those with the Worthy buff are rushed by a ton of shadow thralls and taken thralls and hive thralls. If the thralls make it to the shriekers, the shriekers will start to shoot. The raid team's main goal is to defend those with the Heresy Debuff. Once all the glowing shriekers are dead, the skeletal corpse of Riven will materialize and start chasing those with the Heresy Debuff. Everyone can damage Riven, but Riven deals 100% more damage and takes 100% more damage from those with the Heresy Debuff. Thralls will also continue to spawn. Riven has no mechanics to trigger damage, but he has a large amount of health and is fairly mobile, flying around the island. Once Riven is dead, a chest will spawn and a portal will open. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the gauntlets, hand cannon, pulse rifle, and Titan exotic leg armor Rotten Ahamkara Strides.

Third Encounter: Of Hated Nezarec

As our guardians pass through the portal, they are confronted by a massive Taken Orge, named Savathun's Taskmaster, in a massive cube similar to the 2nd Prophecy encounter, with small rectangles raised above the floor. As soon as they spawn in, Savathun's Taskmaster gets stomped, Tree of Probabilities style, by the true boss of this encounter, Nezarec's Shade. Players all become suppressed, unable to throw grenades, super, use charged melee's, or double jump. Void orbs fall from the ceiling, and one of the four cube walls will begin to glow. Guardians have to throw the orbs at the wall. If they hold the orbs for too long or let them sit on the floor, Nezarec wipes the raid team. Once 10 balls have hit the wall, it will shatter, and taken liquid will begin to seep through the cracks in the wall. Taken wizards with void shields will spawn. They can only be killed by hitting them with an orb. If 4 wizards spawn without dying, they'll banish Nezarec and wipe the raid team. The taken liquid serves as a timer. You have to go inside it to retrieve the balls, but it damages you, so you have to be quick and retreat back to higher ground. The more wizards there are, the faster the void balls spawn. If you kill the wizards as soon as they spawn, you won't have enough balls to break all four walls before the taken liquid fills the cube and kills everyone, forcing you to manage the number of wizards. Once a wall breaks, another will glow, and you'll have to break that one too. The more walls you break, the more the liquid flows in, and the less room for error. Once all for walls are shattered, Savathun manifests and battles Nezarec. Nezarec continues spawning orbs. You have to keep killing wizards, while also throwing the balls at each other. Once a guardian is hit by an orb, they regain their abilities for 30 seconds. You have to damage Savathun during this time, but kinetic weapons don't deal any damage. Only energy abilities and guns, with void weapons dealing 33% more damage. Once Savathun reaches half health, she'll retreat and leave behind a portal and a chest. Nezarec will praise the guardians and vanish. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the chest armor, void rocket launcher, void submachine gun, and the Hunter exotic chest piece, Nezarec's Blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Encounter: Savathun's Defeat

Our guardians enter the portal and are trapped in a large pit. Savathun gazes at them from above and commands them to fight. In this pit, pvp is enabled. The guardians fight each other, but instead of dying, when their health drops to zero, they are teleported into a cage. Everyone who is in a cage get's their buff/debuff changed to Heresy, and the lone survivor gets their buff/debuff changed to worthy. Once there is only one guardian left, the pit floor opens and they began to fall into a bottomless pit. As they fall, void orbs will begin to materialize in their hand, and they'll have to throw them at hive wizards hovering in the hole. Every time they hit a wizard, a cage will open, and a guardian up above will be able to escape. The guardians will then be able to interact with hive cryptoliths around the edge of the pit. If the Worthy player misses a wizard as they fall, and not all five cryptoliths are activated, Savathun triggers a wipe. Once all five have been interacted with, Savathun becomes damageable. The Worthy player teleports to the top of the pit and DPS begins. A random player becomes Worthy and the Worthy player gets the Heresy debuff instead. All players with Heresy get teleported into the cages and the Worthy player has to go back into the pit and kill all 5 wizards. This repeats until Savathun reaches final stand. Shriekers will spawn around the map. Those with Heresy will have to kill them, which will drop void orbs. The five Heresy guardians will have to throw the orbs at the Worthy guardian, buffing their damage by 5% for each orb. Like in the 3rd encounter, if an orb is left on the ground, everyone wipes. The Worthy player keeps shooting the boss until Savathun dies, ending the raid. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the helmet, arc wave-frame grenade launcher, and the exotic solar auto rifle Savathun's Flute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Loot: 

Armor: I'm not an artist, so I'll just say it'd be cool if it was hive-themed.

Weapons: The weapons from this raid can roll with 3 unique perks, 2 in the first column, 1 in the second column. The submachine gun can drop with a unique perk no other weapon can get.

First Perk: Larvae Rounds: Each bullet in this gun is infused with volatile hive cells. Bullets explode on impact and highlight the target. Can roll on the machine gun, sidearm, hand cannon, pulse rifle, and submachine gun. 

Second Perk: Lightdrinker: Kills give a small amount of energy to your class and super ability, and boosts energy weapon damage by 10% for 10 seconds. Can roll on all weapons.

Third Perk(Second Column): Worthy's Gaze: Aiming down sights for a short period empowers your gun, making it stun Unstoppable Champions.

Fourth Perk(Second Column): Nezarec's Praise: When taking void damage, your damage increases by 30% and you regain all your health on a kill. This can only roll on the submachine gun.

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Warlock Gauntlet: Asher Mir's Right Arm:

Intrinsic: Radiolarian Infusion: Melee kills briefly maximize your discipline, strength, mobility, resilience, and recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Titan Leg Armor: Rotten Ahamkara Strides: 

Intrinsic: Foul Aura: Sliding near an enemy briefly suppresses and misdirects them(They can't use abilities and lose their radar.)

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Hunter Chestpiece: Nezarec's Blessing

Intrinsic: Pain God's Gift: Void ability kills refresh your void abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Auto Rifle: Savathun's Flute

1,You cant fucking win in Gambit with randoms,"I've been grinding Gambit for the past 3 hours and I've won about half the time. Those times were when I used thundercrash + cuirass, even though I main Sentinel. I know this is just white noise at this point, but I can't even right now. I need to get 40 fucking kills for my dredgen seal, and I cant even do that! Every type I get an optimal add type, my teammates are fucking glue eaters, and even when I clear 90% of the adds, I still die because the are all waiting by the invade portal.

Then when I try to play properly, all they seem to do is want to clear adds. So I invade, get hella kills, and then we lose because I cant thundercrash the boss and my teammates die before they can bank their whole 15 motes, when we need like 8. Then when i try to help clear adds, we summon a primeval in team, but the enemy team is way to quick due to no opposition in the form of invades. It's nearly impossible. I cant wait for me to get my killmonger and leave."

I know how it can be frustrating to just want to do the Raid with no issues but people want to learn also and I hope there is some groups willing to help out. Once people learn that's just more people willing to help others. 

I remember back in Taken King I was a Noob and after joining countless groups I finally got through entire Raid and then became someone that helped others and even gained confidence enough to do the jumping puzzle all the time for Oryx fight."

1,Special ammo economy,"  I've seen a good amount of posts here recently about how strong our special weapons are and how specific perks need to be removed from archetypes (QD on high impact shotguns). And while I understand the frustration of being aped the whole match I feel a change to the ammo economy would be better suited than gutting entire archetypes of perks that make them feel good to use. 
 
   My thoughts would be to get rid of special ammo drops on kill. Instead a player would spawn in with two or three shots and in order to get more ammo you'd be required to get a set amount of kills let's say five for an example.  After five kills you get a shot back and our scavenger mods can be reworked to add an additional shot just as the do now. A system like this is already in place with PvE since you can get ammo back if you're completely out with all weapons in specific activities. I'm not a dev and I have no idea how hard the coding would be but I personally feel like this is a better route to take instead of nerfing special weapons into the ground or going the crate route from D1 and I feel like this would be a better direction for the state of PvP.  People could still use their favorite weapons while also rewarding primary gunfights and avoid the possibility of someone running around with 12 felwinters shots the whole game or at least lessen the possibility."

1,For those struggling to get the LS exotics,"Fill your engrams with umbral or prime, run lost sectors for exotic engrams (fyi ""encrypted engrams"" show as exotics but are just cores), check your postmaster as if its full you will lose exotics, rinse and repeat making sure your postmaster does not fill (i usually run until 3 exotic engrams then empty postmaster and repeat), collect those engrams when the master LS for that day has the armor peice you want (i collect until i get the piece then leave the others for another day), it works i have successfully gotten a cuirass and icefall mantle through this method.

Tip: run the legend LS easiest, or fastest, for you (i personally run garden 2A in the cosmodrome with anti-barrier sniper and overload smg with anarchy)

P.S. there is no need to enter the master LS or complete it just claim the exotic engrams from the lost sectors when the day is right."
1,"Hey Bungie, can we talk for a second?","I want to give you more of my money. The problem is you have made doing that slightly more difficult for myself, and other guardians. 

I am talking specifically about the Triumph seal pin for the current season.

Before moving on, for those unaware, each seal that has been introduced since Forsaken, has had a real life version made available on [Bungiestore.com](https://bungiestore.com/collections/whats-new/products/preorder-bungie-rewards-chosen-seal-collectible-medallion-pin). Normally the pin ""retails"" for $777,777.77 USD, but if you earn the seal in game, you'll get a code from bungie rewards that allows you to buy it for its actual price of $20+ USD.

The issue is this, the seal requires that we have too obtain all the logs for the ""Bound in memory"" triumph, but you have set it so only one log can be earned a each week. Meaning we if miss a week, we are a fucked out of obtaining the code for the pin. That honestly feels shitty, and comes off as a weird level of FOMO.

I'll continue playing the season and going for the seal, in hopes that you guys decide to alter this, I wont hold my breath though. 

&amp;#x200B;

And before someone comes at me saying ""well maybe you shouldn't have skipped a week"", I was in the hospital for part of week 3 of presage. When I got out, I just didn't have the energy to commit to playing for a few days. The last thing on my mind was the seal/pin."

From what I've seen, the buff starts half way through a slide and lasts just over a second after the slide is finished. I have found that while this is strong, it often only lasts the first shot of a fight. Why not just opening shot then? Just adding one more second would make this top teir. Even adding a timer would help players work with it a bit more.

Also, not working with kill clip is just silly. Why not?

Thanks. Welcome to feedback."
1,Is there any high level PVE content without champions?,"I’m not one of the people against champions, as I think they are an interesting mechanic that forces you to use different weapons every season according to the available mods... which I think is great!

That being said, I also wish there was a PVE activity where difficulty was high, but without the need for champion mods (i.e. I really enjoy using Salvagers salvo with my Ace of Spades... but any content where I can go with that setup, I can basically steamroll it because hard content requires me to use something for barrier champions)

Battlegrounds, Legend/Master hunts and Lost sectors,  Nightfalls, etc all have champion mods... am I missing any activity thats high level without mods? The only ones I can think of are dungeons and they have no matchmaking :("
1,I’ve been trying for weeks to get this new Titan exotic and nothing!! Any pointers?!,"I’ve been doing the legend/master lost sectors but no joy so far 

I’m free to play but have the battle pass and forsaken if I need beyond light then damn fair enough"
1,How much damage is One for All perk?,?
1,Don't be like me and pick up all the Umbral Engrams in your Lost Sector farm,Don't be like me and have [this](https://youtu.be/5W3jxhtjxxQ) happen to you. Turns out a full inventory of engrams bugs out the exotic drop for Lost Sectors. I farmed to get a Falling Star and somehow got Ursa's. Like what?!
1,"12-man content wasn't just fun because it was a Bigger Raid, it was fun because it let me hang out with ALL my friends - the game felt populated, alive, and silly","Obviously it's fun to just blast things with 12 people, and there are real gameplay benefits, sure. But last night my group of friends and I got together and did DSC as a big group before the bug goes away. Our clan isn't big - it's about 15 to 20 active people at absolute peak, usually closer to 10 - but it was the *first time* we've ever been able to really group together and do something, all at the same time. We got our first clan photo that wasn't just the six people who beat any given raid.

Not only that, but after we killed Taniks, we stuck around right until we were kicked out - throwing supers around stupidly, showing sparrows off, and just goofing. It was nice to have a space where we COULD show our sparrows to each other in a big group - something that the tower doesn't offer, even though it's our social space. It reminded me of WoW or FFXIV, where you can see people just gathered around on their mounts - it creates this weird sense of cool, and lets people show the stuff they've gotten in the game off (outside of just armor and titles).

I know Bungie's been collecting a lot of feedback and data specifically around the 12 man activities, but I wanted to specifically call out the non-gameplay benefits of just being able to group up with more friends - because I think they're just as important to making Destiny a game people always want to come back to. Letting me screw around with 11 of my friends, even when we weren't doing anything at all, was some of the most fun I've had in a long time playing Destiny."

1,"Destiny feels stagnant, boring and overall its enraging","Each new season is met with the same old and abused power level grinding, this new battlegrounds mode doesnt even count towards quests like xenology. There is no fun in freemode and crucible is hell-ish. The sun setting over weapons may have been halted but that doesnt not mean currently sunset weapons should remain that way only untill Bungie decides to roll them back in. All this and the tediousness of some quests is silly. This is not D1 were exotics were cherish, this is D2 were there is over 300 exotics some of which either A. Useless like wavesplitter, B. Mediocre and are used rarely or C. Are absolutely cracked as some may see with Dead man’s tale can trivial instances like crucible. All this is is annoying to say the least, and Bungie scrambles around fix items that shouldve been fixed long ago etc.It generally does not feel great at all to play the game."
1,"Mask of the Third Man, D2 exotic concept","Exotic Perk: Unstable Current
""Turn your Arc staff into an Arc blade""

Selectable perk:

-  Showstopper: use your heavy attack to unleash an Arc explosion that damage nearby enemies

-  Razor's edge: use your heavy attack to unleash a wave of energy that travel along the ground

- Vanish: use your heavy attack to disappear out of sight


We have selectable perks on exotic weapons like Suros, why not also armors?"
1,What in the world is going on with Crucible matchmaking this weekend?,"Is it because Trials is down or something? I’m not on much during the week because of work, and i generally do pretty well in 6v6, but it has been nothing but sweatfests the entire weekend and I cannot understand it for the life of me. It felt like maybe SBMM was back, but I found nothing online.

Am I taking crazy pills or is something wonky for other people?"
1,Bungie should add legacy item quests,"So, what I mean is that it would be great if bungie added a item like the hammer of forging or something that allowed players to acquire old items that are no longer acquirable through in game content. 

For example, I don't have the trials chest plate from the old set of trials armor, which I really want. Imagine a legacy item quest that allowed me to play and win modern trials matches (not in a row), plus a few other objectives, that then allowed me to obtain a 46 stat roll ""Vest of the Exile"". *(The reason the stat roll isn't important is because of transmog)*

For guns it could give the curated roll or a predetermined roll depending on how kind bungie wants to be. One last note is that the devs could also allow players to select extra grindy or extra difficult modifiers on the legacy item quest to get better rolls on different items.

My only request is that if it is going to cost eververse resources, please make it so that players can use bright dust."
1,STFU about lost sector drop rates!!!!!!!!,It is a chance for an exotic. That’s it. End of story. Where else is this an option? So for the love of fucking Jesus stop bitching about it. Have seen like 10 subs on here today about this. I’m sure there will be 10 more tomorrow.
1,Chances of Aztec Armor,"What you think the chance of an Aztec inspired armor set will happen, I wanna be hopeful. It could be like a new Iron banner set since iron banner does different warrior inspired armor from history."
1,I had expectations,"I've been playing d2 since the beginning of arrivals. I've seen all sorts of complaints about the game, and frankly, I agree with most of them, but there's one thought that flashes into my brain every time I play...

This game was made by the same people who made the Halo franchise. 

Needless to say, they'd built up quite a reputation with me, and I was pretty let down after seeing how stupidly unbalanced the PVP aspect of the game is and was. Likely will continue to be."
1,Solving 2 Trace Rifle requests with one addition,"Lot of people wanted Coldheart to be Stasis instead of Arc and lot of people wanted Legendary Trace Rifles (this one is actually in BungiePlz)

Now hear me out, we already know Stasis legendary weapons are coming in Season 15, it would be missed opportunity if Bungie didn't make Legendary Stasis Trace Rifle (if you want it to be extra annoying make it freeze people the longer you hold the beam on them)

That's all"
1,How do I get the sniper rifle Adored quest?,"Looking online it says that the 3 respective core activity quests should be available, but they don't appear. Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm a returning player."
1,Soloing a Master lost sector should award exotics with a higher-than-normal stat roll,"There's little incentive to run Master lost sectors over Legend lost sectors when rewards are almost identical. Plus, decent rolled exotics are hard to come by. 


And if not this, maybe have certain weeks out of the season where exotics from lost sectors can be acquired with higher stats."

1,Warlock build suggestions,"I'm kind of in a weird spot right now where I don't know what subclass I want to play and am looking for suggestions.  I'm pretty much open to anything except the warming cell focused builds, because I don't really use Seraph weapons."
1,I haven't played Destiny since the first week of BL. I've just heart about 12 man raids/nightfalls - How can i get involved?,"hearing about 12 man nightfalls/raids was enough to bring me back to destiny (although if sunsetting wasn't being reversed, even that might not have been enough) but I have no idea how I get involved with this.   


I've spent the last two days trying to get as much power as I can, and i've gone from 1200 to 1265. Will this be enough to get involved? I know im under-leveled for end game content, but is it likely people will let me join in the fun? If so how does one do this? And what are the limits? Can this be used to grind out Legendary Lost Sectors for the exotics I'm missing? Can it be used to get a ton of masterworking material in highlevel nightfalls? What about using it to get titles from running grand masters?   


Sorry for the basic questions but I would love to learn enough to get stuck in before it goes away on the 16th."
1,Masterworked mods?,"I just realized that mod components have almost no use so maybe we could use them to masterwork mods?

So you have a handcannon that has 10 base ammo and you add the backup mag mod and get 12 ammo. 

You masterwork the handcannon and then there is an option to make whatever mod you put on it masterworked so on that very same handcannon after spending like 10 mod components, glimmer, and an enhancement shard you get 13 or 14 ammo instead of 12"
1,"I think besides a few expections, Titan subclasses are all viable with the right build","This is just my personal opinion but honestly I’m liking where Titans are at right now. Yes this usually requires mods or exotics and master-worked armor to do so, but I’d argue most subclasses are actually fine. Now all of these aren’t 10/10 but I’d argue they have uses. Let me use Titan because that’s my wheel house. Also this is PVE only really, as PvP will likely never have all 10 subclass trees good at one time. 

Void: 
Top Tree: it’s bubble, every boss encounter you are asked if the group has a bubble. It is nice that middle tree solar warlock had well so it’s not as mandatory as it was in D1 but glad to see it in D2 as an option. 

Middle Tree: An intellect build with Ursa Furiosa actually puts this as a top tier choice for GMs. You always have a super and a safe way to get buffed damage on targets.

Bottom Tree: Using Doomfangs this becomes a really good add clear super, maybe not the best but a good option. It gives Sentinel Shield more range use and that’s always good.

Solar: 
Top Tree: This might be my least used tree out of the three just because of the other two trees offer a little bit more. The super can have a large blast radius but in high level content it would at best be used to target one yellow health mob. Melting point just isn’t where it used to be with other option but if it’s what you got it isn’t horrible.

Middle Tree: Now I know what you are thinking, this super is cool but sucks in practice. I personally love using this subclass tree, yeah it probably needs the most love out of all of the trees but if built correctly it can be awesome. I use hallowfire heart and wreck with grenades and the hammer, it’s hilarious seeing the hammer take a quarter of a yellow health bar. I use hallowfire because you are likely not going to use this super often as it isn’t the strongest option in higher level content and can leave you vulnerable. If the super sees a buff it could be much more useful. 

Bottom Tree: For sure the strongest Titan build for add clear to me, Phoenix Cradle can allow you and your teammates to burn stuff for days. Also use some warming cells to add even more flames to the fun. 

Arc: 
Top Tree: Alright I know I said all are good but honestly unless you want two grenades without using Armamentarium, then this have no major advantage over bottom tree, I guess if you wanted to spam heavy attacks to have tick damage on a boss you could but at that point use middle tree with Cuirass of the Falling Star. The best build I see for this is Skullfort and infinite shoulder charge in lower level content but if you don’t get a kill in high level stuff you are screwed. 

Middle Tree: Speaking of which, this is my favorite super, hands down. I liked it before the new exotic. If you want pure boss damage use cuirass as that probably is more viable. If you want to constantly have a fist of havoc, use skullfort to clear mobs and have fun with that melee! 

Bottom Tree: This was my go to add clear for some time, using skullfort ensures you will never need to worry about a melee charge time so you can spec into other stats. Also the super lasts a long time as long as you are clearing those adds. 

Stasis: 
Behemoth
Alright I may catch downvotes for this opinion but it’s probably the weakest in pve among its Hunter and Warlock buddies. It’s slow and clunky, and burns through super energyt trying to clear mobs. I get it, freezing stuff is cool, but if you were using bottom tree Striker they’d be dead and you wouldn’t need them frozen. That’s just my opinion tho. 

I’m no expert but I had three Titans in D1 and didn’t have other characters besides a Titan in D2 until shadowkeep. This is probably the best spot they have ever been in, but hopefully some of the lesser supers get buffed."
1,Power scaling for harbinger?,"So I decided to try harbinger for the first time solo cause the recommended power for it is apparently 1270 and I’m 1305 currently so I figure it would be tough but still doable after a few tries. Turns out I get killed in three hits from a taken vandal right at the beginning. I thought that was a lot of damage for someone over 30 power levels higher than the recommended and I decided to test my theory by doing lake of shadows and see how many times I can get hit by a taken vandal there before dying with the same gear. In lake of shadows it took 6 hits. 

If the max advantage I can get for being overlevelled is at 20 above the recommended then shouldn’t the damage being done to me by the same enemy be the same for both lake of shadows and harbinger? Or does harbinger scale to your level if you’re above 1270?"
1,Celerity / Bottomless Grief should be intrinsics,"As they are now, a bottomless grief rolls turns into an instant shard for me. Same for celerity.

I get that Celerity weapons are unique to trials and it's the ""oh shit clutch time"" buff, but it ultimately dilutes the pool. If these were intrinsics (and Celerity slightly weakened), it would likely feel much better."
1,New crucible gamemode???,"bungie should make a game mode with no abilities or VERY limited like grenade every 2 min with 10 discipline something to see how to the game plays without abilities. I think it would help point out outliers weapon wise in the meta and show what needs to be balanced and what shouldn't be (but they would fix it till 2 years later lol) Just a thought, I would play it a lot not sure if others would since the emphasis is on  gunplay and not who can spam abilities more."
1,My Taken King PS4 just died after 5 long years of gaming with it.,"I used to game Destiny 1 on this thing every day back when Taken King dropped, all the way through to Destiny 2 before its first DLCs when I moved to PC. This little war machine has seen so much use and abuse I am not surprised it started to die. But damn, its like losing a pet, honestly. A big part of my life is now a dormant display piece. Not even sure if I will be able to get another PS4 in my current situation."
1,Vault spoils,"Anyone know for sure if it’s safe to put spoils of conquest in the vault, I remember it used to delete them because of a bug but I don’t remember if it’s been fixed. Would like some confirmation"
1,There is nothing more insulting than Running 10+ Master Lost Sectors and receiving 2 Exotics and 5 Masterwork Cores. (Lost Sector Rant and Tips),"I've been hunting for some good Ashen Wakes and between yesterday and today I've been grinding Lost Sectors.

I've learned a few things from this experience.

1. On Legend, Exotics drop about 1 in 8 to 1 in 10 Platinum runs. The longest drought I went without any Exotics was 15 runs.

2. Go for Platinum. You probably can recieve Exotics from lower but it must be a much, much lower chance. There were times where I was on 1 rez and I couldn't be bothered with a Champion so I went for Boss. I did not get an Exotic in any of these runs.

3. Overload Champions SUCK. Since Beyond Light dropped in November Overloads in general seem to stun and immediately unstun way more often than before. This season I'd recommend Le Monarque for them thís season. 

Barrier and Unstoppables aren't as bad. The only problems I've had with them are Barrier Champs coming out of their Barriers but this is easily remedied by shooting them ASAP. Unstoppables will unstun if affected by Stasis, so keep that in mind. 

4. Unless you are at LEAST 5 over the Master recommended Light Level don't bother with them. More, fast runs with slightly lower odds are better than less, slow runs with moderate odds. 

In Legend you're also less likely to break your controller because the BARRIER CHAMP WON'T STOP SHIELDING THE F&amp;#KING OVERLOAD. 

5. Try to use weapons and mods you like. The  AntiChampion Mods this season are on weapons that a lot of people don't like. Use weapons that are closer to your own playstyle. You like Autos but not Scouts? Try a Trustee. Personally, I enjoy using Snipers and Bows for Barrier and Overload and Sniper and Devils Ruin for Unstoppables and Barries.

6. Take breaks. You will get burnt out. Don't try push through. Do something else. Altars of Sorrow. Dance at the Tower.

Rant time. 

Bungie really needs to up drop chances for Master. Like a lot. I hate posts like these but there needs to be some light at the end of the tunnel for these things. Every time I open that boss chest and see and Enhancement Core a little piece of me dies. 

What's worse is the Exotics I did get were at most 62s with terrible stat distribution. I want me Exotics to have spiky stats. Not looking like flat wall I'm banging my head against. 

Tl;dr Bungie needs up drop chance, give good exotic stats and fix teleporty enemies."
1,Exotic Primaries need more love,"utility like Hawkmoon has in solo-flawless prophecy runs is much needed in them imo. the effects they have in PvE need to be touched. i miss things like bad juju having as much of a presence as it used to back in the day, now that they’re all being overshadowed by specials/heavies nowadays."

1,Is there really a point to keep vaulting stuff at this point???,"I uderstantd why vaulting even started in the first place and i supported the idea initialy (i think waaaaay too much stuff left for the new light’s) but here are my issues with keeping it going

1. After the first month after Beyond Light release the game became depressingly boring due to general lack of content (don’t even justify season of the hunt it was garbage) and until Witch Queen all seasonal content is gonna leave. If Bungie would Vault more stuff the game would just get too empty to keep Playing even considering new content in wich queen.

2. Forsaken is the biggest DLC ever released that already got hit by DCV and honestly i can’t imagine losing Last Wish and spider’s shop

3. Isn’t Bungie like expanding 3x times??? OK now saying they can’t sustain this game while not vaulting is just ridicoulous 

4. New light experience is already trash. As a new light player you can’t get any idea what game is about because you can only do bounties and have no story to be motivated by. If they Vault Forsaken this will get even worse with a bit of bounties leaving and story wich if they watched Cayde 6 compilation they could give less of a fuck about.

Im not here saying that they should insta unvault everything because that is just insane demand. But stuff shouldn’t leave anymore."
1,"An idea for a ""fun"" challenge","I know a lot of people have already reached Rank 100 and are just waiting for more content, so if you need something to do to bide the time, I've got a challenge for you.  The challenge is to reach season rank 100 entirely from the Cosmodrome (with an exception).  

How to get started:

* First, make a new F2P account on Steam, Xbox, Playstation, etc.
* OPTIONAL: Purchase the season pass.  You don't have to, as it may be considered a waste of money, but it will speed up the challenge

What is allowed:

* Any content in the Cosmodrome including bounties, patrols, New Light quest, lost sectors (including legend and master), and strikes (including the Disgraced, Devil's Lair, and Fallen SABER Nightfalls)
* The Tower and the HELM
* Quests that are required for the seasonal artifact.  This season requires you to do the first battleground on Nessus to get the artifact.  You can go there to get the artifact but that's it.
* Multiple characters are allowed and recommended to speed this up
* Seasonal challenges that can be completed in the Cosmodrome or its strikes.
* Tower/HELM bounties that can be completed in the Cosmodrome or its strikes
* You can visit Xur IF he is in the Tower
* You can play with others as long as you follow the challenges' rules while doing so

What isn't allowed:

* Traveling to the EDZ, Nessus (except for the case above), Tangled Shore, Dreaming City, Moon, or Europa and/or any activities associated with those locations.  
* Playlist strikes, Crucible, Gambit, dungeons, raids, Presage
* Cosmodrome Battleground.  Even though it's in the Cosmodrome you have to do the Europa battleground to unlock it.
* Deleting characters.  You could theoretically delete characters and remake them to repeatedly do bounties.  Do the challenge legitimately.

The goal:

* Reach season rank 100 under these requirements

I highly doubt anyone will actually do this, but its just something that I came up with tonight.  If you do decide to do this, have fun with Shaw Han."
1,"Just did Riven Legit for the first time, and it was the most amazing thing in Destiny I have ever done.","I felt bored today and decided to LFG for a sherpa to teach me legit riven. Took about 20 minutes but I eventually found 2 sherpas. Me and 3 other people have never done legit riven before (one never even did Last Wish ever before) and we went in. The sherpas were very nice, and they did not rage when we wiped and showed us what we did wrong. We eventually completed it after 2 hours, and it was amazing. The music is intense af, riven is very creepy without clipping her toenails, and it was overall the most amazing experience I have ever had in Destiny. Anybody who has never done riven legit before, give it a go. You will not regret it, and you will find a new appreciation for Last Wish and Bungie's raid design in general."

1,Severance Enclosure needs to be buffed or reworked,"As a melee exotic, it lags far behind Dunemarchers and Synthoceps in efficacy and doesn’t even work with stasis. Unlike Dunes and Synthos, it can’t proc on an uncharged melee. Thus, the only two Titan subclasses that see any kind of real benefit from it at the one time are bottom striker and middle Sunbreaker and neither of those are optimal in most content at the moment. Even then, when you do manage to proc the perk, the explosion does not do all that much
It’s a shame cause it’s such a good looking chest piece and I think the perk has potential if more changes are made. But if the Aeons are good now, this can be too"

1,Palindrome Still Not Dropping,I have run 10 1300 nightfalls already trying to get a single Palindrome to drop and got nothing even with prosperity equipped. It was the same with the 20+ 1270 nightfalls I ran as well. The rarity on Legend says that a nightfall weapon drop is Common or so I believe. At this point I am just pissed. The gun just doesn't drop and I have no idea what I am doing wrong.
1,VOG Worlds First,"Why are so many players saying when VOG returns it should not have a world first? I totally understand that since they already had one for D1 but D2 is very different then D1, it has different weapons and is much faster. VOG will probably have some sort of cosmetic update as well. If they add champs into the raid that will be another difference. The challenges are also something to spice up the race. It feels like the prestige or hard mode raids and their races so what is wrong with those races compared to VOGs race?

I’m just confused why people are so opposed to having another raid race."

1,We need more grenade launchers in endgame activities and activities in general,"Let’s make you guys realize that since destiny 2 has come out there has been one raid that had it as a normal drop and another as it’s exotic drop. It’s great that we got 3 grenade launchers in a few months but that doesn’t make up the fact that these are some of the most used weapons in the entire game and yet we have no diversity in them, it’s either salvo, truth teller, and anarchy, because deafening is not that great. I’d love to see new grenade launchers in raids and more activities in general that expand the norm for them, like a wave frame launcher that has chain reaction"
1,Arm mod slots are over crowded,"with the move of dexterity perks to arms. 

and the champion mods made into Armor mods instead of weapon mods

there is just so many different mods that could be slotted into the arms that it is in my opinion to clustered

back when the dexterity mods where apart of the legs, the arms although slightly less populated then other Armor pieces, it gave a type of balance between scavengers and dexterity, would you pick more ammo or greater ease of use. and in PvP this was an important choice 

and with the cost of non primary champion mods being upwards of 6 energy, in my mind it doesn't fit that there is such a high density of mods on the arms

&amp;#x200B;

but this is just my opinion, I'm curious as to if this is an common thought or I'm alone here"

1,"Dear Bungie, the year is 2021. Give raid exotics bad luck protection.","Just made this post because it makes me very upset seeing people complete almost 3 looted runs every week and not get the rocket - Eyes of Tomorrow. 

I know two people who are in this boat and this makes me really sad. I have seen people get it on their first try who dont even play the game anymore, so it baffles me that a raid exotic tied to a seal does not have bad luck protection.

Just because this bad luck spree happens to minority of the playerbase does not make it okay either.

Please Bungie, its 2021. Give dedicated raiders some bad luck protection. They paid for the expansion that released in November and still haven't got the exotic? How the heck is this okay? Do you think anyone likes being disappointed every week 3 times for 5 months? Seriously this sort of drop mechanism is outdated and makes me genuinely upset.

I am not ranting because I don't have the exotic. I do have the exotic. Seeing people fall victim to bad luck makes me really upset. This is a game bungie not win a lottery. There should be mechanisms that grant bad luck protection for raid exotics at the very least."
1,When In Doubt Nerf Hunters Some More,"Hunters have received the most nerfs in the life span of the Destiny 2. But if a hunter makes a post about being nerfed, we don't get 1.7k upvotes about it. 

Solar hunters got crapped on with nerfs over the years. The only good thing is the throwing knife and people want that nerfed even more! ""Blade barrage is strong"" nova bomb is better and does more damage and tracks, then creates mini nova bombs that track after. 

Arc hunters neutral game might be the weakest in the game, the tree nodes all got nerfed back in the day. Bungie reason for it this was ""they were used more then the other nodes"". Middle tree reflect uses up so much super its stupid. Its a melee super but its so slow, nova warp can close the gap so much faster and has an aoe attack. Nova Warp is better then Arc Strider. 

Void hunters.... Do I have to mention how bad Tether is, or is that already clear? Middle tree super is the only good thing about void hunters in pvp. But that subclass got nerfed over and over, people still want it nerfed again. ""Crouching headshots give wallhacks"" I would agree with you, but Bungie nerfed the crap out of that. 

Stasis hunters ""insane tacking on its melee"" The crazy tracking is not from the first initial throw but after it hits something. You still have to mostly aim, its not an aoe explosion like warlock stasis that insta freezes then tracks to something else to insta freeze. After the nerf, 2 melees wont even freeze you.  Shatterdive, a two step process for a grenade to kill you. let me repeat, 2 step process for a GRENADE to kill you! That got nerfed into the ground, but Titans shatterslide, its 2 step process to kill didnt get tounched. Shatterslide is way stronger, lets them slide crazy far, twice! And their slide shatters any crystals or frozen targets.  Stasis hunter super is actually bad over all, its insta freeze is the only thing good about it. You jump and hang in the air with very little damage rez to throw 2 things. A lot of the time hunters dont get to throw the tornado, but when they do, it gets stuck on a wall or a stair. Its so bad, I might as well use Tether.  

At the start of Beyond Light, Hunters dodge cooldown got a nerf across the board just because. No reason given, just Bungie wanted to.  Stop nerfing Hunters!"
1,"This may sound extreme, but I think the only way to balance Gambit is to disable exotics","No EoT, Truth, Xeno, Cuirass of the falling star etc.

Those exotics are too powerful in gambit. You get free kills with those heavy and insane damage with the chest piece.

And after grinding gambit for two days I know how easy it is to kill an an entire team with EoT, or instantly melt the boss with 4 titans.

It’s an extreme step, I know, but it might be the only way to save gambit cause right now it’s simply not fun. No exotics. That’s it.

Jokes aside, I’m glad someone commented on it and that my fashion sense raises eyebrows whenever someone sees it."
1,Adding a new weapon or two to the raids each season would be a nice way to give players incentive to return to them as the seasons go on.,"Currently, it feels like raids gradually lose relevance as seasons go on, because as players start getting good rolls of the weapons they want, they have less reason to want to return to those raids in the future. By adding a few new weapons now and again, you give players who already have what they want from these raids a reason to start doing them again each season. 

Additionally, none of the raids have a full set of weapons in their loot pools. and it would be nice to see them filled out, like how the first two Leviathan raid lairs filled in the gaps in the original Leviathan loot pool."

Which should be my priority to get?"
1,"At this point, players should be able to purchase any and all Warmind and Charge with Light mods. No reason to hold players back from exploring more loadouts.","As someone with all of these mods, I wish everyone had access to them because they're a lot of fun. Especially when you make fireteam builds. If you've never made a build with one teammate buffing the rest of the team with charged with light and warmind cells, while the rest of the team are running power of rasputin, high energy fire, and focusing lens this season, you're seriously missing out.

The support player should be running Stasis (for focusing lens) with mods like quick charge &amp; wrath of Rasputin (With the Seraph Shotgun and Xeno) and mods like powerful friends, taken charge, and a choice between things like striking light, radiant light, stacks on stacks. 

The buffed players should be running high energy fire, focusing lens (running light classes), power of rasputin, and things like buring cells or Lucent blade/Godslayer Rounds or supercharged. It's a great time!

On top of that, Bungie should really make saving builds a feature so players could save builds and bust them out without going through the whole process again."

Spider is selling glimmer/baryon/dusklight for shards, and also datalattice and spirals for glimmer.

The weaponsmith is selling upgrade modules for dusklight / baryon, AND ascendant shards for datalattice.

It's literally perfect. If you're sitting on a ton of legendary shards, you can max out your ascendant shards (10) / upgrade modules (25) today. You should also get each of the planetary mats that spider is selling up to 1.5 or 2k or whatever you feel is a good buffer."

1,Frags of rasputin &amp; Lance,"First of all, pardon my english!

Alright, are you titans ready to spam some sun spots and grenades? This build focuses on the fact that you can create sun spots and those lovely warmind cells with polaris lance. And believe me, you're going to swim in those sun spots!
Ait let's break it down!

Subclass:
Bottom tree hammer titan. Sunspots and health regenration are the key.

- You are able to throw a LOT of grenades.
- You are able to pierce barrier champions shield and deal with one other champion type depending of your kinetic weapon!
- You are able to heal yourself by getting kills with solar abilities. (Dunno if the lance works on this since it can create sun spots.)
- Sun warrior gives bonus to weapon damage. (+20%)
- Your abilities recharge really fast thanks to elemental wells and Hallowfire heart exotic chest.
- You can run low intellect and focus on other stats thanks to the font of wisdom.

Weapons:

Kinetic
- anything really, high dps sniper or shotty or somethong to deal with champions

Energy
- Polaris lance baby (or Ticuu's divination or any solar splash damage weapon but no, for the love for lance)

Heavy
- Sola's scar with chain reaction perk (code duello would do as well or any solar splash heavy if that matter)

Armor:

Helmet - any energy type
- Global reach (1 energy) (must)
- 2x ammo finders (2-6 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (I use dicipline)

Arms - solar
- Elemental ordnance (3 energy)
- Anti-barrier scout rifle (1 energy)
- Impact induction or other champion mod (1-3 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (discipline)

Hallowfire heart - any energy type
- Font of wisdom (4 energy)
- Any resistance mod (1 energy)
- Sword reserves (2 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (discipline)

Legs - solar
- Burning cells (I don't have rage of the warmind) (3 energy)
- 2x scavengers (2-6 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (...)

Class - solar
- Wrath of rasputin (1 energy)
- 2x bomber (4 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy)

Ait about the playstyle. SLAY. Throw a ton of frags, pick up elemental well and stand on the sunspot. Lance adds and those who die to dragonfly or the perfect fift explosion will create sunspots. You can literally spam your abilities and create those sweet sweet warmind cells. Your heavy can clear out big groups of adds at a time. For boss damage use heavy or kinetic of your choice. Succession with vorpal and reconstrucion is pretty darn good.

TL;DR
Use the weapons and armor mods listed earlier and slay throught any activity. And have fun.

Make sure to read my earlier hunter lance build as well. Cheers guardians!"

1,Adjust the drop rates for legend lost sectors,"Pretty straight forward post. I've decided to do k1 revelation 15+ times today on legend, and I haven't gotten the exotic chestpiece. I have a feeling something isn't right, how is it that people are getting in on their 1st, 2nd, or 3rd try, yet I've done it 15 times and I can't. I think the rng is very flawed. Any tips? I want to keep grinding but I now know nothing is going to drop for me. And yes, I am getting platinum and doing them in under 15 minutes. Even if rng is the case, I think bungie should adress this issue because folks shouldn't be doing empire hunts 50+ for cloudstirke and empire hunts until they feel sick. Please adjust the drop rates."
1,"Bungie, please give us the option to pick and choose what planets we want to have downloaded. Please do not remove Forsaken!","This is what the DCV should be! Picking and choosing what destinations we want downloaded like mini dlc packs. Many of us are so over vaulting locations, stories, strikes, and raids that we love to play. If Bungie is so concerned about space then they should let the players choose how much they want at once

Losing Forsaken would be a death-blow to the game. It is the best content that Destiny 2 has had to offer and maybe even better than any location Bungie has ever created(Looking at you Dreaming City). 

Not to mention it was $40 and removing that plus the $60 from the base game is just a kick to the gut to veteran players. I can’t even imagine if I couldn’t go back to some classic D1 locations, strikes, or raids in the first game. 

Before anyone mentions it...I highly doubt most vaulted content will EVER return."
1,Game down for anyone else?,[removed]
1,Can we have some of the D1 cloaks back?,"Like idk, but the old cloaks from D1 (Venom of Ikaheka, Strength of the Pack, VoG cloak, etc) just have a feel that no other cape in D2 has ever been able to replicate. Like, nothing has ever come even remotely close to matching the feel that the old cloaks have.
So, can we have some of them back? I know we got the Trials cloak back, and that's cool and all, but I especially miss Venom of Ikaheka."
1,What kind of game modes should bungie add into crucible?,"Personally, ive found crucible to be very stale for quite some time. New subclasses and metas shake it up but were still playing on the same maps and game modes over and over. 

Im not game developer, but i do see other studios cranking out new game modes for their arena shooters on a regular basis.

Having said this, I’m curious what kind of game modes the destiny community is interested in seeing lord shaxx bring to the crucible. Would love to hear your best ideas for game modes in the comments. Here’s a few of my favorite ideas:

Golden Guardians:
Players have the ability to equip exotic loot in all slots. The builds... they would be a sight to behold

Target Practice:
Super, grenade, melee, and class abilities are locked. Give us that pure arena style shooter

Class based warfare:
A playlist that fills lobbies based on your class. This means a 6v6 lobby of only titans, hunters, or warlocks. Bubble titans go brrr

Finally i think destiny’s mechanics are just so satisfying that a lot of game modes from first person shooters would work great in this game. Take hardpoint from COD as an example, would force us to engage in unorthodox parts of the map."

1,My idea for the witch queen raid. Please give your thoughts and opinions,"1st Encounter-  All 6 gaurdians have to stand on an individual hive rune to unlock the door. During this encounter immune Knights will shoot at them at a height. At the halfway point of the rune completing their shields will drop and the gaurdians will have a limited time to kill all of them. Failure to do so will result in a wipe.

2nd Encounter- A giant maze that has Giant Knights wielding axes. Each player has a knight that chases them through the maze. There are 6 starting paths. At certain points paths will cross and the gaurdians will be able to stun eachothers Knights. Causing them to drop a relic. Once all relics have been collected the gaurdians will lead all of the Knights back to the middle and make them group up. All gaurdians will have to throw the relics at the Knights to cause them to be damagable to all players. Faliure to kill all of them will repeat the maze process with less Knights.

3rd Encounter- An Immune Ogre boss will spawn in the center of the room. Ads will spawn after and once all ads have been killed a random gaurdian will be selected. 6 doors will open on the sides and the selected gaurdian is the only one who can see the real door to go through. Once all gaurdians have gone through the door they will be teleported into different rooms. In each room there will be another ogre that they must kill. Failure to kill all ogres will result in their being a much shorter damage window for the main boss. Once all ogres have been killed the gaurdians will be teleported back to the main boss and be able to damage it. At random the boss eye will start to glow a bright red and only one gaurdian can see it happening. That gaurdian will have to shoot the eye to stun the ogre. Failure to do so will result in a wipe.

4th Encounter- A massive debris field is the only way to get across a gap. One gaurdian will have to stand in a rune to see the true path and guide the rest of the team over. Once the 5 gaurdians are across. They'll have to stand in runes to keep the path open for the lone gaurdian, but while they're keeping the path open thrills will constantly rush at them. 

5th Encounter- Boss- I hive wizard with 8 tentacles on its back will spawn in.  It will be immune. Ads will spawn in as well as immune Knights from the second Encounter. Once all ads have been defeated each gaurdian will be teleported in to their own room with one of the Knights. The room will be pitch black and the knight will constantly rush the gaurdian. When the Knights raises the axe to attack the gaurdian has to shoot the Knights arm to stun them. Once all Knights have been stunned, they will all become damageable and each gaurdian has to kill their knight. Failure to do so will cause the Knights to be there during boss damage phase. Once all Knights have been killed the gaurdians will be teleported back to the boss room and able to damage the wizard. At random the wizard will stab at the gaurdians with the tentacles and they will have to dodge them. After 7 seconds the bottom tentacles will wrap around one gaurdian and lift them in the air. This gaurdian will then see 2 of the other 6 tentacles and have to tell the other gaurdians which tentacles to shoot. Success will result in another 7 second damage phase. Failure to do so will result in a wipe. 

Final stand- Once the boss has reached final stand each gaurdian will be teleported back into their own room with their own boss. They will have to damage the boss but at random one gaurdians boss will have 2 tentacles glowing and call out which ones. All 5 other gaurdians will have to shoot those tentacles on their boss. Failure to do so will result in a wipe. One all 6 gaurdians have seen the tentacles glow and shot all of them. All of the tentacles will glow and become weak spots. Once all tentacles have been destroyed the boss will teleport the gaurdians back to the main room and be very weak. Once the boss is killed a door will open in the back of the Encounter and the chest for loot will be there."

I'm sure this is a silly question, but I've been away for ages, and haven't even read anything about the state of the game these days, so I don't know if this is a temporary thing. Or maybe I need some sorta inventory item to cancel this out or whatever.

Should all my old stuff with this warning be dismantled?"
1,Linear Fusions,"The kinetic slot is in sort of a boring place for special weapons, you get to choose either a shotgun or a sniper. I would like to see linear fusions reworked to be kinetic only specials, using arbalest as the forerunner. A kinetic counterpart to the energy-only fusion rifle. Linears don't really have a good place in the heavy meta and I think they would fit as more ammo efficient charge-up snipers that deal a bit more damage per shot in pve and operate comfortably in the mid to mid-long range."
1,Turn energy and kinetic weapon slots into standard weapon slots,This solution allows us to remove the need to balance adding kinetic and energy special weapons This also allows you to run all 3 elements on a single loadout  at the sacrifice of primary damage (because energy primaries do less damage  then there kinetic counterparts) on top of that this preserves every current build and opens up new ones example being ikelos sniper and ikelos smg stuff like this I doubt this will ever happen but a hunter main can dream
1,Giving shotguns a consistent pellet pattern might be the way to finally get them balanced.,"Before you downvote because ""shotgun ape bad"", just take a second and consider the points I'm making.

Felwinter's is the most used PvP shotgun by far. Why? Because it has a consistent pellet spread and quickdraw, and was relatviely easy to get. I'm not going to discuss quickdraw in this post, that's for another time.

People are calling for Felwinter's to be either turned into an exotic or nerfed heavily because of just these two attributes. 

That said, **what if we gave every shotgun a fixed pellet pattern**? It doesn't have to be a perfect circle like Felwinter's, it just has to be the **same pattern every time**. Maybe make each shotgun frame have a different pattern. Once you remove the RNG component of shotgun range, it becomes much easier to balance them properly. 

If the spread is consistent, the falloff/range can be adjusted until shotguns are in the place they need to be balance wise. You'd (theoretically) have far fewer moments where you either get mapped or whiff your shotgun shots, adding consistency to the experience at both ends.

For an example of what I'm talking about, look at CS:GO. That game is basically the polar opposite of Destiny in that shotguns were basically useless because of great ranged options (rifles) and slow movement.

A year or two ago, they removed random pellet spread entirely. They gave every shotgun in the game a unique, **fixed** pellet pattern, and removed RNG from the equation for ranged kills. They left in the movement and jumping inaccuracy, but that is more of a CS:GO concept, less of a Destiny one. Now, shotguns are in a better place than ever before, and have a proper niche in the meta. They aren't OP, but they aren't ignored completely. 

Just some thoughts that came to mind."

1,Account Ban/Appeal,[removed]
1,Bring back old pvp rewards pls Bungie,"So I think we can all admit that sunsetting was a ""fix"" for specific weapons (Mountaintop, Revoker, Recluse). In a post sunsetting world I think that Bungie should bring back our old beloved pvp weapons. It would breath life back to the pvp playlists like comp (since players might actually have a reason to participate in it). Could even just make them (or the original trials of the nine weapons) after match rewards in Trials. 

What if you could earn skins for these weapons through playing comp if you already have them? Or even some new random rolls?   


1. At this point is there any reason we shouldn't be able to use Luna's Howl or Not Forgotten? 
2. Is there a reason we can't get a recluse with a modified version of Master of Arms (or even a different perk entirely? Or Random rolls?). 
3. Revoker at its core would always break ammo economy so it would need a new perk as a replacement. 
4. Redrix might need a new set of perks since people would have grinded for their pervious rolls (although Messenger seems strictly better so could just increase infusion cap).  
5. Leave Mountaintop gone for good. (I hate nade launchers in pvp. I dont think any pvp players would be happy to see Mountaintop ever again) 

I don't like reissuing gear at all. However, this could be a low effort (low time investment) thing that Bungie could do to help PvP even a little bit. Since it is reissuing (to some degree) Bungie should be able to make these changes faster than creating entirely new stuff with new identities.   


This doesn't solve the problems with pvp at all. Stasis is still a problem (probably still will be after the nerfs). It also doesn't solve the problems with the comp or trials playlists....but it at least gives people an incentive to play pvp."

1,Can We Add Buff / Debuff Stacking Back?,"I get it that it was way overpowered in the past, but it really hurts/devalues so many weapons, classes, and mods. The buff/debuff meta is just so... boring. It was so fun to think through all the buffs and debuffs you can stack on something to see how much you can melt it instead of just defaulting to bubble/well and divinity on occasion. 

I feel like all that has to be done is have the buffs/debuffs stack with diminishing returns after a certain percentage. Endgame content should have the expectation of having players work together and synergize for damage instead of making it just some scripted thing like it has been for quite awhile now."

1,"An idea for legendary lost sectors, make each revive you have when you open the chest increase the chance an exotic will drop","Legendary lost sectors are great IMO, it's nice to have something to farm solo when my friends aren't on and I don't feel like grouping up with ransoms, but finishing one and getting nothing but glimmer and materials feels pretty bad. I was thinking, something to incentivize going flawless could be increasing the chance you'll get an exotic from the chest for each revive you have stacked up when you finish the lost sector and open it."
1,Speculation: The new location in Witch Queen will be Torobatl which has been turned into a Hive War 'Moon',"This is pure speculation. Destiny will likely never actually leave the Solar System, and with the number of places in the system yet to be explored dwindle, as well as the desire to actually see alien worlds, I feel we will get just this in Witch Queen.

A War Moon in general makes a lot of sense, with another potential location being the Ammonite moon that use to orbit Fundament and was confirmed to be a War Moon. However, with Xivu Arath having recently confirmed to have conquered the planet and the Cabal fleeing it, it would be the ultimate show of strength if the Hive then arrive in our solar system with a corrupted Torobatl being their largest war moon ever (At that point, the term moon is hardly fitting).

This would fit with Caiatl's desire of reconquering her home world with out help while also justifying why they have such a heavy involvement. Personally, Torobatl looking very Roman but in ruins would offer many opportunities and is an exciting prospect.  

Lastly, while I know there has never really been planets turned into war Moons, the power of the Hive seems stronger than ever now. 

I would also like to add that we will also likely get a new Cabal and Hive enemy type in witch Queen in the same vein of how we get a new Vex (wyvern) and Fallen (brig) enemy type."

I dropped off again after Beyond Light but heard this season was good so jumped back in and...

Oh my, the story telling feels like its improved tenfold, the missions (Presage) are stellar, the seasonal activity is fun and having finally gone back and done DSC, I loved it. In the process of trying to convince my old fireteam to return to the game I've realised the value that D2 really has now. For the first time in a while, I'm very excited for the future of the game"

1,Suggesting for Raid Guided Games w More than 6,"From doing several raids 10-12 man over the last few weeks, it has become glaringly obvious that is it much easier to teach mechanic heavy raids when you can have a newbie “shadow” someone performing a specific job.  We ran a Garden run for Divinity with 9 people, and it went so smoothly.  But even more importantly, we could teach the newbies what the jobs were without the frustration of wiping to sacs every few minutes.  The new people were able to watch and ask questions, without the weight of the raid on their shoulders.  I will sometimes stream a raid before sherpaing, so that the newbies can see what is supposed to be happening without the pressure, but this worked even better.  Just an idea that I think more people would do guided games for raids or dungeons (both as guides and blueberries), if we were able to take a few extra people.  This is way better than raid carries, because the kindergaurdians are able to actually learn the position, rather than being tasked with “stand over here, kill ads, don’t get in the way”, and having no idea what was actually happening. 
Just an idea to help get more people through raids."

-I currently have diamond 1 ELO in booth survival and control (solo), so you can’t just tell me I am just a dogshit player to invalidate my post

In previous seasons there may have been some op stuff but these past few seasons have just been so infuriating that I see no point in trying to get better in crucible or even playing it. 

With all of the ability spam and three peaking this game has become so slow, boring and skill less. I know that stasis was intended to create this slower environment but it has gone way too far and comp games just feel so annoying.

With all that being said I just don’t know what to do, I grew up on this game and met so many friends from it and I don’t want to quit. Do you guys have any recommendations to help make this game less infuriating?"
1,The fact that you can straight up get nothing after completing a master or legend lost sector is actually fucking bullshit,No cores or anything just straight up nothing but glimmer and some planet materials.

Did Bungie just forget to adjust the base infamy for bounties when they removed the prime bounties that gave 100 base infamy and the ‘do them anywhere’ bounties that provided 50 base infamy?

Feels like resetting infamy would take an eternity without bonus weeks/weekends and is painful even with them.

For instance, top-tree gold gun is a very strong super in the right circumstances, but because you get no super resistance, you can still just get sent to the shadow realm by a felwinters. I don't see many arcstaffs, so I don't know about how well they perform, but top and bottom tree tether are just jokes. Idk how bungie would buff them without making them op but I hope they just get a bit better."
1,Season of the Wolves [Fan-Made Season],"Howdy, I was bored and I wanted to feel creative so I came up with a fan made season that would give us a taste of Rise of Iron in D2. However, the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to make it affect Iron Banner as well. This post will be lengthy so TL;DR will be at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

***Prologue***: Season of the Divide starts with reports of SIVA being found on New Light Guardians (this will actually affect New Light Players) so we must investigate it. Before we go further, I want to make the community to experience the Owl Sector event that took place before Rise of Iron by making any player who started playing when Beyond Light start the spread of SIVA to all players. Encountering them in the tower, Strikes, Crucible, Gambit and Public Spaces will spread it or you can encounter by doing to the Divide and investigating SIVA nodes near the Exodus Garden lost sector. This then would send you to the Helm to avoid bringing it into the Last City where Saladin reaches out through a call. Saladin is angered to see SIVA back and wants to send an army to once again end SIVA while it is only on Earth (for now). 

&amp;#x200B;

***Enter the Guardian***: Our seasonal activity will send us to a familiar place from The Dark Below, a revamped version of the ""Siege of the Warmind"" where we discover Ana and Rasputin fighting against SIVA Cabal and Fallen with Ana switching between Statis and Gunslinger while Rasputin is creating Warmind Cells to use against SIVA as well as his robots from Season of the Worthy. Here we discover that Cabal who don't want to side with Empress Caiatl made an alliance with the remaining army of the House of Salvation whom want to takedown the so called ""Great Machine"" with anything they can get their hands on. Together the Cabal and Fallen becomed SIVA'd to become more than once before, thinking they have control now. Upon ending the mission, Rasputin and Ana fill up the gap between Beyond Light and now telling us that Rasputin has a new and improved version of SIVA which we can control and destroy with the power of Rasputin which brings us to our New Combat mod system, Nanite Null.

&amp;#x200B;

***Nanite Null***: Unlike Warmind Cells, Nanite Null is purely based of the Seasonal Weapons and new seasonal Exotic Armor as well as Outbreak Perfected ***to increase its endgame usage*** (looking at Sleeper Simulant). Nanite Null works in 3 different ways: Control, Support and Execution.

* Control causes enemies affected by Nanite Null to stop SIVA grenades from being thrown
* Support causes benefits to the player and Nanite Null abilities
* Executions causes Nanite Null to be lethal

Players will combine different forms of Control, Support and Execution to give Nanite Null a directive that it will continue to do until told otherwise (this is a reference to a gilmore card from Destiny 1).

&amp;#x200B;

Here are examples of 3 forms of Control, Support and Execution.

Control:

* **Leadership**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Null weapons look for the nearest mini-boss or boss
* **Recall**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Null weapons mini-boss and majors search for rank and file enemies
* **Redirect**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Null search for the nearest enemy

Support:

* **Spread**\- Enemies affected by Natine Null will spread Natine Null to others upon death
* **Weaken-** Enemies affected by Natine Null will take 15% damage extra from all sources for 
* **Rally-** Enemies affected by Nanite Null will grant ability energy and have an increased chances to create ammo for allies

Execution:

* **Autonomous**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Control attack whoever they searched for. When 3 enemies are killed by Autonomous, you become Charged with Light x2. Enemies attacked by Control enemies will deal more damage to Controlled enemies.
* **Decompose**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Control will cause DoT to whoever they searched. When 3 enemies are killed by Decompose, an elemental well will spawn matching your subclass. Decompose will do increased damage to the original target and will weaken as the original loses health.
* **Destructors-** Enemies affected by Nanite Control will cause enemies to exploded once they are near 3 of the enemies they searched for. The stronger the enemy controlled, the stronger the explosion. If 5 enemies are killed by Destructors, create a Warmind Cell. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Seasonal Activities***: This seasonal will include multiple activites with one including a new space on a SIVA'd Fallen Ketch. This Ketch would be the secret mission that allows the players to unlock a new Exotic Void Heavy Sniper. The six man seasonal matchmade activity will similar to the first encounter of Wrath of the Machine for the different weekly bosses, but will work like Battlegrounds with a series of objects where the player faces SIVA'd Cabal and Fallen. 2 New Lost Sectors have been added from the EDZ which will be available at all times however you must be at the previous season's max level to enter as well as these lost sectors will have champions with contest mode. The 2 Lost Sectors used will be The Pit as well as The Flooded Chasm which will be SIVA'd.

&amp;#x200B;

***Seasonal Weapon Rewards***: To have Nanite Null, we need to have the weapons for it which will be acquired from SIVA Sectors and the matchmade activity.

Weapons will include:

* **CHAOS DOGMA\~**: This Scout will be returning with random rolls, but does have a curated roll earned from the SIVA Sector that drops it that day. This weapon will be Arc matching the exotic version and it would come with Triple Double along side a new perk called **And Repeat** which causes any extra rounds gained to do 30% extra damage
* **QUANTIPLASM\~**: This Shotgun would run to us as a Void Shotgun and its curated roll would improve on its raid version. This roll would make Battle Runner into a perk that grants armor and speed as well as a new perk called **Full Stop** which grants Overshield after stunning an Unstoppable
* **STEEL MEDULLA\~** This Pulse would be in the kinetic slot. The curated roll will have Sign of Four like the original as well as a **Overflowing Light** which gives this gun the chance to make you and your allies Charged with Light after getting precision kills on combatants
* **EX MACHINA\~** This sniper would return as an Arc weapon and its curated roll returns will have Alloy Mag, Clown Cartridge and Triple Double
* **NANOCHAOTIC\~** One of the first two new heavy weapons would be a Solar Linear Fusion Rifle where its curated roll has 2 new perks: **Firing Squad** and **Swarm**. Firing Squads allows you to rapid fire your linear like the SIVA Wire Rifles in D1 after getting a precision kill. Swarm grants a 30% damage buff against all Nanite Null enemies after getting 3 headshots with any weapon
* **ANDROID DIRECTIVE\~** The second heavy weapons is a Void grenade launcher which a curated combo meant for endgame. The roll would have **Blinding Light** and **SIVA Clusters**. Unlike all Nanite Null Weapons, this weapon in its curated roll does not require a kill to activate Nanite Null.

***Seasonal Exotic Armor and Weapons***: SIVA Sectors will be the way you earn new SIVA Exotic Armor as well, but there is an exotic ornament earned in Iron Banner for them (More on that later). There is also 3 exotic weapons coming, 2 from Destiny 1 and the New One is from the Secret Mission, each will have a catalyst.

**Armor**:

* **Jolder's Heart:** Void Detonators turn into SIVA Nanites causing Overload and debuffs enemies (20%) to SIVA or Nanite Null weapons.
* **Felwinter's Core:** Blink turns into a horizontal teleport (like SIVA captains) and enemies near the Blink get trapped by SIVA Nanites temporary. Killing trapped enemies grants extra armor and melee damage.
* **Gheleon's Wish:** Swarm Grenades causes Overload and become SIVA Nanites. Kills with the Nanites will cause more Nanites to spawn. (Similar to how Thorn and Necrotic Grips work, Outbreak and this chest will work together)

**Weapons:**

* Season Pass Exotic will be Dreg's Curse, a SIVA Dreg's Promise. This three round burst weapon causes SIVA charges to drop on precision kills which can be picked up to thrown at enemies for a decent amount of damage. Its catalyst will cause enemies who are hit by SIVA charges to fight for you and grants a 6% damage buff per enemy hit (max 30%)
* Iron Banner will have its first exotic quest in Destiny 2 and it is Young Wolf's Howl. Its will work exactly how it worked in D1, but will swing like Crown Splitter and heavy attacks cause enemies to take more damage from Solar Damage. The catalyst will cause light attacks to build up damage for a heavy attack. (24% per light attack for max of 120%)
* The Secret Exotic Sniper is called ***Plague*** which will be a 90 RPM Void Heavy Sniper. The exotic perk will increase damage per bullet after a headshot, missing a shot removes all stacks. The gun will have 7 rounds only however its catalyst grants another round that needs to be charged by 7 rapid headshots from itself. Landing all 7 shots makes the final round deal double the damage of the 7th round and deals a DoT damage equal to one shot over 5 seconds.

***Armor and Iron Banner:*** Iron Banner is in need of a rework in general so I wanted to share my idea... 

**Gameplay**: Mayhem Clash, Zone Control, Rift, Iron Forge and Iron Control. The first 3 modes are from D1 while the second 2 are something I made up. Iron game modes don't have Heavy or Supers, but Iron Lord Axes instead. Iron Forge is an Axe only mode while Iron Control has Axes spawn every 2 minutes and regains ammo from capturing Zones and getting kills with Axes are how you win. 

**Banner Armor**: Iron Banner has been using the same armor for years now and I think it is time for D1 sets to come in D2 instead of use getting repeat armor. Starting in Season of the Wolves, all guardians will be receiving the Iron Regalia Set. There will also be quest to earn a SIVA-less version of Iron Lord SIVA Exotics ornament.

**Season Pass Armor and Ornaments:** The season pass armor will be a SIVA'd version of D2 Warmind Armor with the ornaments making the SIVA coming from the armor match your subclass. 

***Summary of the Story****:* Lord Saladin is gonna to have an character that allows him to allow Rasputin to be an ally for the bigger threat, but it will not change his mind on SIVA. Saladin plans our siege on the Fallen Ketch which is how the Fallen were able to bring it to Cabal around the system. Lore vise, it makes sense that followers of Eramis would be after SIVA since she was after Outbreak Perfected in Season of the Drifter and the Cabal forming an alliance is not to strange since the entire current season is about such alliances. The titles were will be Young Wolf for the seasonal content and Iron Lord from Iron Banner.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

* SIVA Cabal and Fallen
* 3 Exotic Weapons: Young Wolf's Howl, Dreg's Curse and Plague
* New 'Old' Iron Banner gear
* New Combat Mod System using SIVA Nanites
* 3 Exotic Armor Chest Pieces that are SIVA Iron Lords
* Rasputin and Ana return
* Secret Mission on a SIVA Fallen Ketch
* SIVA Sectors
* SIVA Seasonal Armor"
1,Hello fellow Warlocks. If you run mid tree solar with Sanguine Alchemy you can have a rift up at all times.,"The post is the title. If you have a buddy with you, Sanguine Alchemy and mid tree solar you can have your empowering or healing rift up at all times. I'm not sure if this has been discussed but I've been having a lot of fun with it with my friends in PvE. Especially strikes or dungeon sections that promote defending a point. Just set up a rift and go to town.

I tried so hard playing D2 from the start when I found out, due to lack of juicy one-liners and nostalgia from D1...Hopefully someday after the saga is over Bungie will end up releasing some sort of Trilogy stand alone with everything up to Forsaken, but beggars can't be choosers...."
1,Class Equity: How to Better Balance in Class Effectiveness for High-Level Crucible,"I’ve been seeing “class equity” thrown around the sub recently, and I really like it. After all, we don’t want class “equality” since then there wouldn’t be a real distinction between the classes and negate their entire purpose. “Equity” implies that each class should get the same attention and should offer a fun, powerful experience for players.

With this in mind, I wanted to express my own opinion as someone who has been playing Destiny since The Dark Below. I’ve seen lots of PvP metas come and go and am not too bad (I think a 1.2 or so K/D though I haven’t checked in a while) and have completed each raid in the game at least once. Here’s my take on the problems with classes in PvP.


Disclaimers first: I am a Titan main and I only play console, so my PvP opinions are made (specifically about dodge) with that in mind.

**bold**Why Are Hunters Dominant in the Crucible?**bold**

Three points. One: Hunters have been the dominant class in PvP, and especially competitive PvP, since at least D2’s start when they were all granted dodge as an intrinsic ability. Two: That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but… Three: The other two classes should receive some other factor to raise the playing field.

Now, Hunters, don’t downvote quite yet. I admit I am a huge Titan main and also that Behemoth is broken. I want to explain what I think the big issues are and see if anyone agrees since I haven’t seen this opinion on the sub, at least in the way I think of it.

Hunters are dominant. What does that mean? Recent data from guardian.gg actually shows that warlocks (specifically stormcallers and dawnblades, and we all know which trees they’re using) are just as high in use and win ratio as hunters. But, in aggregate, I think (someone correct me if I’m wrong) that Hunters still reign supreme.

Now, dominance is not necessarily a bad thing. No matter what Bungie does, some class or subclass will be determined to be the “best” by the sweats and that’s fine. But I don’t particularly like that it has been Hunters for so long. Yes, even during the OEM and Antaeus Wards metas. I guess for me, “meta” is what you see in Trials. For a long, long time, it was three Hunters or maybe two Hunters and one Warlock or Titan.

(I actually remember back in D1 when the sweats were all Warlocks with hand cannons, and that was what you saw in Trials, so the Hunter dominance has not been unbroken. But I digress.)

The aforementioned Warlock meta actually illustrates my point really well. Why were Warlocks the go-to class for D1’s high-end PvP? In my opinion, it was because their melee had a longer range. Back then, they also (I think) melee’ed at the same rate as the other classes.

In that way, Warlocks had a flat advantage to their neutral game. Additionally, not all Hunters could dodge: only a single subclass with what was considered to be a subpar super ability.

D2 launched and all Hunters had the ability to dodge no matter what. Additionally, dodge cooldowns are, by nature of mobility being a good PvP stat to begin with, very low across the board practically even though in practice another class could theoretically have a shorter cooldown.

Hunters are meta now, and have been throughout ALL of D2’s history, because of one ability. The dodge adds on to additional things that make Hunters’ movement the best in the game, such as their jump, which enables them to shoot while in motion. Top tree Dawns can also shoot while actively jumping, but no other class or subclass can. For example, as a Titan, I can jump, but I can’t shoot while maintaining my momentum.

These two things together – the Dodge and the (mostly) unique ability to shoot while preserving jump momentum – mean that Hunters are the best PvP class in terms of neutral game regardless of abilities.

I do not want to take this away. I strongly feel that the mobility described above gives a lot of identity to Hunters. Instead, I want to add things to the other two classes to help them compete.

**bold**Titans and Warlocks Are Also OP… Sometimes**bold**

Titans are sometimes perceived as OP because of a few factors. For one, I believe Titan subclasses are, Behemoth notwithstanding, not OP, but they often get OP exotics that make up for it. Original OEM is the go-to example, as were the Antaeus Wards. But when you take an OP exotic away, Titan subclasses don’t offer a lot to their neutral game, particularly since many of their abilities are melee-focused but that brings you into shotgun range.

Warlocks are a different story. They often start with excellent kits that are, as has been noticed by the community, absolutely demolished by the devs with repeated, often overhanded nerfs after repeated complaints.

**bold**Why is There a Long-Term Discrepancy?**bold**

So sure. Sometimes there are metas where Titans and Warlocks are more competitive. But that’s the exception rather than the rule.

Repeat: This is a problem mostly for console players, I think. The jump and dodge mean that Hunters cannot reasonably be tracked or competed against in close quarters.

Here’s the problem. The class identities Titans and Warlocks are, I think, at odds with an ideal PvP experience.

Titans are supposed to be tanky or aggressive strikers who take tons of damage and thrive in close-quarters combat. Problems:

•	All classes use shotguns, and Hunters use shotguns better than the other classes since, as mentioned, they can jump and shoot while preserving their momentum.
•	Furthermore, Hunters can totally break aim assist and (more importantly) maneuver around a player’s field of view faster than anyone can humanely react by double tapping crouch. Hunters are, therefore, the best shotgunning class in a duel. Titans can compete with their slide with raw aggressive pushes against non-shotgunning opponents
•	Titans cannot feasibly be granted more health in a practical sense since it would break the game. More bullets to kill a player when the player can shoot back with the same guns would be unfair and break Titans overall

Warlocks are supposed to be space mages with OP abilities and fast regeneration. Problems:

•	Make the magic too powerful, and you create an oppressive PvP environment where gunskill doesn’t matter. The community complains, they get nerfed
•	Boost their regen further and Warlocks would likely become turtles who hang around the back of the map all the time, slowing gameplay and lowering the “it” factor that often makes Destiny PvP so enjoyable

Hunters, I know I’m ragging on you hard here, but stick with me. Hunters thrive because their kit complements an ideal PvP environment. Hunters:

•	Can jump quickly and gain elevation in an instant in a way the other classes just can’t
•	Have kits that are often about boosting gunplay or aim assist or reload or some other neutral value
•	Have what amounts to a get out of jail free card on console. I know, I know, you can tell me so many times when someone fusioned you out of dodge or something. Doesn’t matter. In most practical cases, a dodge grants a Hunter another try at a gunfight OR the opportunity to escape

Here’s the bigger issue. This creates an explicit breach of class equity for high-level PvP. Hunters, so long as they have the best movement, will always be dominant and the other two classes will be unable to compete.

Why is Behemoth so popular with Titans? The super is OP sure, but more than that, the slide and melee punch give Titans comparable movement to Hunters for the first time in D2. There was a reason the best Titan players in D1 ran Twilight Garrison. Movement is king.

Further ruining things is Bungie’s apparent developer bias against Warlocks and for Hunters. There was no reason whatsoever for the Hunter shuriken to get buffed last pass, although it is fortunately being nerfed again. Right now, the environment benefits Hunters to such an extent that, once Behemoth is nerfed, I fully expect Crucible’s competitive PvP to be almost entirely comprised of Stasis Hunters and Top Tree Dawns. Stasis Titans will still be there because of the punch alone.

**bold**Solutions**bold**

So, what can Bungie do?

The way I see it, there are two options to increase class equity. Firstly, they could give each class a unique movement ability to be on par with the Hunter dodge. I don’t want this to happen for a few reasons.

•	It negates the Hunter identity and unique style of play
•	It makes each class feel even more similar than they already do

By that last point I refer to when Luke Smith said that playing different classes didn’t feel like much of a choice. I disagree as to the extent he claims, but I see his point. In PvP, each class can do what each other class can do when it comes to simple mechanics i.e. double jump, throw grenades, etc.

The second way Bungie could fix this problem (as I see it, anyway) is to make the other two classes feel more distinct in a way that doesn’t break the sandbox, in addition to stop nerfing Warlocks to the ground and buffing Hunters. Hunters do not need buffs AT ALL.

As I said earlier, something simple and slapdash like giving Titans more health or Warlocks more powerful grenades might not be the way to go. And I admit that I am not a developer or have experience designing game systems.

However, I do think that there are ways to improve things. Just off the top of my head…

•	Warlocks should be mages. Can they all get two grenade charges by default as an intrinsic ability, instead of OP grenades?
•	Warlocks should all be able to blink, perhaps? That’s different enough from dodge that I don’t think it distracts from Hunters’ roles and unique playstyles
•	Warlocks’ rifts need faster cast times. Right now casting one defensively if a Hunter is within dodge range is a death sentence
•	Titans should have a longer melee range by default, or do more melee damage by default. Right now Striker Titans and Arcstrider Hunters have extendable melee abilities, boosted melee damage, etc. But which one wins out in a shotgun contest? I’ll let you guess…

•	Titans could be resistant to slow or freeze, or take slow ticks less often to reflect their tankiness
•	Titans take less bodyshot damage by default, but not less headshot damage? Idk that might be OP

Bottom line: right now you can’t really improve the practical effectiveness in a neutral game context of Titans or Warlocks without OP abilities or exotics because the Hunters’ class fantasy/identity is superior in all cases. Bungie needs to come up with a way for Titans and Warlocks to shine as Titans and Warlocks, not as Behemoths, Dawnblades, etc. 

**bold**Quick Counterpoints**bold**

*italics*Hunters aren’t OP! I get killed all the time and I’m a Hunter!*italics*

I don’t care. Hunters are not “OP” per se, but the field is titled in their favor at all times except for brief windows where one other class gets an OP exotic or new subclass (Titans and Warlocks).
*italicsHow are Hunters so dominant if I kill them all the time?*italics*

Well, I don’t know. I think you’re blind if you want to tell me with a straight face that Trials and Comp are not consistently dominated by three-stacks of Arc, Solar, Void, or Stasis Hunters depending on the meta and which  new subclass came out.

I also think that it makes sense that the worst players, as well as the best players, are Hunters. Hunters as a whole class (not subclass) are the most populous in the game, so obviously you’ll have the best and worst players in Crucible with them. The Titans and Warlocks you see in Trials or Comp that perform well, in contrast, are likely good at the base game.

*italics*You’re just a salty Titan main.*italics*

I guess a little. But I really don’t want to neuter Hunters or make them unfun to play, and Dodge is super fun to use.

**bold**One Last Word…**bold**

I’ve already written too much but this stuff really irritates the hell out of me: stasis should not freeze past Banner Shield or inside Ward of Dawn. I cannot stress enough how much this does not make sense.

In WoD’s case, the bubble already has a big weakness compared to the Ice Tornado, the Well of Radiance, or any other lasting super. It goes away if the caster is killed. Kill a stasis hunter and the tornado keeps spinning around. It makes no sense that bubble goes away when Tornado, Nova Vortex, Thundercrash aftershocks, Well of Radiance, and plenty of other abilities (even grenades) keep burning or going after their caster is killed.

Furthermore, right now you can get frozen in the Ward of Dawn. This is a problem since, at the moment, you do not have armor of light when you are frozen. Instead, your health is replaced by the frozen health metric or bar or whatever the game uses, making it very easy to shatter and kill you with a single shotgun blast. It’s totally dumb, Bungie, that someone can throw a duskfield in the bubble, dodge near me with Bakris, and freeze me to totally negate my super and waltz in and shotgun me without a defense.

Banner Shield is even worse. Icebolts go through the shield, a Behemoth slams the ground near you and freezes you… It’s just absurd. Please consider this and make it impossible to be frozen in bubble period since being frozen essentially kills you anyway, and make it so the banner shield actually guards ice projectiles and fields.

**bold**Wrap Up**bold**

If you’ve made it to the end, thanks for reading. I’d love to be told it’s me, I’m wrong, that I need to get better at the game or something. But when I have seen three-stacks of Hunters instead of mixed teams of Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks for years on end, I have to believe it’s Hunters, not me, who are inherently unbalanced.

TLDR: Hunters are inherently the best because of dodge. The other two classes should get something else that makes them competitive instead of nerfing Hunters."
1,i bought the legendary edition except from the campings what else should i do,i had friends that play this game but they don't play anymore so i don't even wanna know how to write since with every expansion there's a lot of content and i wanna get better and stronger i have 1100 power from playing for 40 hours free 2 play and doing the base campings it would great if you could tell me what is good to grind i also like playing with hand cannons and rocket launchers
1,"I know everybody prefers a more ""chaotic"" Crucible, but a focus on widening the skill gap would make the casual and hardcore experience much more better","With the high aim assist/bullet magnetism, special weapon crutching, ability spam and more, Crucible will never be fun for the average player.

1,Motes siphoning should keep going even if a Primeval is summoned,"Unless the teams have a similar motes banking timing, is pretty much guaranteed that the first to summon will win no matter what, and only if your team has an invader that can get multiple kills with every invasion you can catch up, but still your Primeval slayer stacks will be way lower than your opponents (even though I don't know if there is still a catch up mechanic and correct me on this one in that case). 

Blockers during the Primeval phase are just a mild annoyance and you can pretty much ignore them for the most part, unless a goblin is shielding the boss or knights are burning everything.

If the siphoning would keep going, maybe a bit slower to not be broken, you have to consider if is better to kill the blockers or just focus on the Primeval, like for example when a strong invader would start killing your team and not letting the Boss to be damaged. You can ignore them but you can risk to make the opponents to catch up faster. 

Summoning first would still be a big advantage, but in a less one-sided manner"
1,I hope the Witch Queen raid comes with a raid sidearm.,"Title. Sidearms are tied with trace rifles for having the least raid representation in Destiny 2 (one of each, Last of the Legion and Divinity respectively). However, there are two differences there - one, trace rifles are essentially an exotic-only weapon class, and two, Divinity is currently obtainable, while Last of the Legion is not. This makes sidearms the only weapon class with no obtainable raid weapons in Destiny 2 after the vaulting of Spire (grenade launchers and smg's don't have any in-raid weapons available but Anarchy and Tarrabah can be bought from the kiosk). Not to mention that Last of the Legion was from SPIRE - a year one raid, and we haven't gotten a new raid sidearm in any of the five subsequent raids. And VoG returning won't fix this because it doesn't have a sidearm either!  
Please, Bungie: give us a raid sidearm again in the Witch Queen's raid."

1,Weapon swap bug,"So I’ve been experiencing this since I want to say the start of this season, or since one of the early patches this season and I’m wondering why nobody else is talking about it. 


If you are using a kinetic in your primary slot and a special weapon in your energy slot (ex. Extraordinary rendition &amp; adored) when you try to switch to your heavy from your kinetic weapon (1st slot) you will quickly begin pulling out your energy weapon before actually swapping to heavy. This happens to me every time no matter what weapons I have on, as long as the previous conditions are met (kinetic primary, energy special).  This does not affect swapping from energy weapon straight to heavy. 


However, if I have a kinetic special and an energy primary (ex. Heritage &amp; Ikelos) I am able to switch from my heritage straight to my heavy weapon without seeing my Ikelos smg in between.  As long as these conditions are met, weapon swapping is normal. 


I have tested this and it seems to work like this consistently"

1,Gambit needs a Freelance Playlist,[removed]
1,Do you guys see how hard it is for Bungie to please you?,"Attunement of Control got nerfed recently. No it's not 'nerfed to the ground' like I've seen people say. No it's not ruined in PvE either, especially if you have high intellect with Geomags Stabilizers, which why wouldn't you.


An argument I've seen is that only a small portion of the community plays Trials so a nerf for such a small group and specific playlist is crazy. Is it though? Are you telling me that getting a super every round is balanced? Even in Comp and Quick Play the amount of Chaos Reaches you can get is insane. 'But Stasis is unbalanced' yeah and Bungie has already started nerfing it. They're slowly balancing Stasis as to not overnerf it but bring it in line. One half is happy while the other is mad.



Then there's the general Warlocks get nerfed quicker. Just remember that Shadebinder was nerfed before the holiday break at Bungie, so it felt like forever for Behemoth and Revenant to be nerfed. Also just to be clear: yes, I agree that in *CRUCIBLE*, Warlocks are indeed weaker. But, if you're even decent at Crucible, you can use stuff like top tree arc (Sidezz), bottom tree void (TrueVanguard) or even Well of Radiance for the memes in 6v6 (CammyCakes). Cause get what? If you're good, it doesn't really matter what subclass you play. 


Let me also make it clear: Warlocks are by far the best subclass for PvE. It doesn't even come close, with the only contenders are bottom tree sunbreaker with Phoenix Cradle or Hallowfire Heart, middle tree void with Ursa's or top tree void. An argument could be made for Cuirass of the Falling Star but in Master/GM nightfalls that would be sacrificing Ursa's which is more effective for the entire team. As for hunters, tether isn't even necessary anymore with other debuffs being more accessible, Divinity being the main one. Bottom tree void is pretty good for the invisibility and Revenant with Mask of Bakris with Anarchy and any arc weapon is also quite good. Celestial Nighthawk is something you simply switch to for DPS but besides that, not really that good.



I feel like I should also mention that Shadebinder is not bad *at all* and I don't get these 'OVERNERFED' comments like what? Did you even try it? It's still good in PvE with high ability up time and freezing potential and in PvP you still have a pretty good subclass. It's like one person says 'omg overnerfed' and everybody says the same thing.



Do you guys have any idea how hard it is to code this game to have stuff be different between gamemodes? Shit, they even mention in the TWAB that some changes had to be affected in PvE too. That's why disabling emotes and swords in Trials is taking so long. 


It's also funny how nobody mentions the other Light subclasses (PvP) for Titan and Hunter as if those aren't bad too. Blade Barrage, top tree Arcstrider,  both Tether, or top tree Hammers, bottom tree Sentinel etc.



Anyways, I just feel like the people in this sub are like some kind of hivemind but whatever."

1,Hot take: Activities with a shitload of modifiers are not the issue. The true issue in grounded type modifiers that take away the fun of movement in Destiny,"I have done plenty o NFs, GM and Master and there is always one thing that blows my mind on how bad it feels to play against...

Grounded type mods

I say ""type mods"" bc there are multiple modifiers that affect in-air damage taken

Pls... these modifiers are the worst part of any modifier heavy activity


I am okay with burns... I am okay with In-air based enemies (shanks, servidors, shirekers, etc) doing more damage

But taking away the vertical fun that Destiny has, Bc of a modifier is NOT FUN IMO

Maybe Change it to so that, *while U are in the air you DO LESS damage*... But not take more damage...

Dunno how Yall feel about this... but GMs and masters would be so much more enjoyable if grounded had another effect."

1,What will happen to faction specific ornaments?,"I couldn't find any information about this anywhere online so no idea if it's known or not. Back in year 1 Destiny we were able to unlock ornaments for the Crucible and Vanguard armor sets. And unlike todays universal ornaments, those ornaments can only be worn if you wear any piece of armor from either of those 2 factions.

Does anyone know what will happen to these, will they stay exclusive or will they too become universal?"

1,I'd really love a Halo-style game mode in Crucible,"It wouldn't fix all of the issues with PvP right now, but a mode where we can use the movement, abilities and gunplay from Destiny that we all love, but with a pre-determined set of weapons scattered around the map would be a ton of fun.

It would be a thousand times easier to balance in terms of weapons and they could even rotate the weapon set around every now and then to keep it interesting."
1,"High stat Dreambane armor, where are you?","I want to preface this by stating I haven't completed Pit of Heresy yet, but I know it used to drop a masterworked armor piece from the final encounter, though I'm not sure if those were high stat or if they still drop.

I want a full set of high stat armor that accepts nightmare mods (working towards getting Moon triumphs done) and I'm not sure if there's a way to farm high stat armor like the Dreambane sets. Seems like the Lectern only drops low tier armor, and with the set being re-issued I'd love to have a way to farm some good rolls. It's been quite some time since I did nightmare hunts so I'm not sure what the rewards are anymore, but that shader for Master difficulty is calling my name.

Any tips on getting high stat armor drops would be appreciated, especially if there's a method to do it solo."
1,If you don't prepare for Crucible it will feel unfair.,"I have seen a lot of posts and comments recently talking about how Crucible feels unfair and surprise!!! It is designed that way. Many players jump into Crucible thinking they will be on the same level as their opponent but put zero effort into building their characters, armor,, and weapons to pull off a win. You can't just jump into PVP with warmind cell mods  and PVE perk weapons after your strike and expect to have a good time or an advantage on your opponents who have grinded hours upon hours to get the proper PVP gear and weapons for Crucible.

So here are a couple things to consider before you get salty about Crucible gameplay and experience. And WARNING THIS IS A LONG POST. I am not an expert and typed this up on my phone so I apologize and don't have all the exact numbers but I feel confident in sharing this info. In no particular order...

1. Does your character have 100 recovery stat or close to 100 recovery? This can be achieved by equipping recovery stat mods on your armor for 4 points or by finding and equipping armor with high recovery already in it. I'd you don't you disadvantage yourself and your teammates in gun duels because your opponents can heal up much faster and re-engage you before your health is back. 

2. After 100 recovery do you have over 50 resilience? If you didn't know anything less than 50 resilience drops you into the range of being able to be killed by 2 shots from some weapons instead of 3. That means if you duel 1 on 1, normally, you have to land 3 shots on your opponent and they only have to land 2. Which means if you both have perfect accuracy he will always kill you before you have a chance to kill him if you both shoot at the same time. ( seems unfair to you in the match because you don't understand why you died so fast but to him it's because you were not properly set up. And FYI to us serious Crucible players we will check all the enemies stats and loadouts before the game starts, in the Roster tab to see who the easy prey will be. Looking at you 100 mobility 20 resilience hunter ha ha.) 

3. . What are the perks on the weapons you are using? Does your legendary weapon of choice have PVP perks such as; mutikill clip, killing wind, rampage, swashbuckler, opening shot, Quickdraw or do you have PVE perks like surrounded, Dragonfly, 4th times the charm.. etc ( basically some perks are better than others for PVP and it depends on the weapon you are using. Same goes for PVE).

4. Are you using the best subclasses,  jumps, aspects for stasis, and grenades etc for each character. While it may be fun to play bottom tree dawn blade on warlock you will get outclassed by someone playing the top tree dawnblade if you are strictly playing to win. ( This is assuming of course that each player is skilled enough to pilot both subclasses properly to maximum level. )

5. Map knowledge.  How well do you actually know the maps you are playing on? Do you know where the headshot angles are or common paths players will take? Do you know corners and angles where you will have an advantage on view over you opponent? Do you know every tunnel and where the heavy ammo spawns? How about where the overtime flag will spawn? All of this will be important in determining where you set up, where you push,  where you hold and protect. I can't stress enough understanding the maps. The best way to learn them is simply by doing a private match and exploring or just playing and learning from deaths and experience

6. Have you put into the time and effort to acquire PVP mods from Banshee and then equip them? Mods such as High-Energy Fire, Taking Charge, stacks on stacks, powerful friends, etc...  if you didn't know, having just high energy fire and taking charge makes it so you deal more damage until you get a kill after you pick up an orb of light.  

Also mods for the weapons you have equiped play a big role such as unflinching ""hand cannon"" mods,  ""hand cannon"" targeting mods, ""x"" loader or dexterity mods, ""shotgun/sniper ""scavenger mods ( equipping one of these makes it so you pick up extra special ""green"" ammo when you walk over it after a kill. So if I have it and you don't I now have 1 extra shotgun/sniper shot over you and I have the advantage. Which brings us to the next point.

7. Have you Masterworked you armor and weapons so that you can equipping these mods and increase your armor stats and get orbs of light? 

Armor first. If you don't put materials &amp; golfballs into upgrading your armor you won't be able to equip all those mods we just discussed.  Also masterworking your armor will give each piece +12 ( +2 for each category) on stats for your character meaning if you masterwork all 5 armor pieces you will get +10 to each stat category on your character.  So that 40 resilience becomes 50 just by masterworking your gear. 

Now weapons, if you masterwork a weapon it gains stats into 1 category boosting its overall performance. This is how two players can be shooting the same gun, same perks but one shoots farther than the other before damage fall off, or one can reload slightly faster than the other. This is due to the masterwork having a range buff or reload buff for instance. Also after you masterwork a gun it will create orbs of light on precision kills ( head shots) which if you remember gives you and your teammates, whoever picks up the orbs, a damage buff with the proper mods. So when you decide to try out a new gun you just got from gambit or wherever without masterworking it just know you put yourself at a disadvantage against a fully geared player.

8.. Lastly you need to understand your weapons time to kill and kill range. Each weapon has an optimal time you can kill someone.  This is based on you correctly landing each gun shot as quickly as possible with 100 percent accuracy. For example 1 head shot and 2 body shots or 2 head shots and 1 body. Some guns are faster at killing than others. 120 hand cannons typically require 3 shots to kill and have a time to kill value of about 1 second, (for the veterans this number is obviously an average but it works for the discussion.) 140 hand cannons are slightly faster at like .9 secs but require you to be closer and sometimes land more shits if you miss the headshot.  Pulse rifles and submachine guns can be even faster but require you to land multiple bullets. I am not well versed in each weapons time to kill number, you can Google those later if you are curious,  but the point is that if we both have perfect accuracy shooting at each other exactly at the same time. One gun will have an advantage over the other in certain instances. What this means is that you need to learn your guns kill time and look at what your opponents are using to understand theirs. 

 Also range affects these kill times as well. Pulse rifels and scout rifles can shoot farther than common 120 and 140 hand cannons. So if you pick a fight against a scout rifle down a long corridor with a 140 hand cannon they will most definately beat you before you can get in range to hurt them. 

*** Also a last disclaimer, even if you get the proper weapons and guns you still will get beat by good players.  This is where the fun of Crucible is. Finding ways to outplay and outsmart your opponent after getting all the proper gear is what makes me come back every day. It's a thrill seeking challenge that I look forward to. And I only have a 1.22KDA so nothing to be boasting about***

Alright this has been a long post but I hope you understand just how much is going on inside of Crucible.  Next time you feel like it was an unfair match maybe take a look at your gear and see what you could improve to bring yourself up to your opponents level. I am by no means an expert on this subject unlike many of the great streamers and youtubers I have watched but I feel like the info is pretty valid. Hope it helps. See you in the Crucible Guardians."

1,Perk Configuration Concept: Better RNG," 

By [u/JarekoLT](https://www.reddit.com/u/JarekoLT/) and [u/trustniico](https://www.reddit.com/u/trustniico/)

**The Hook**

Imagine a system where Guardians unlock and collect perks for weapons as they find them through random rolls. Once these perks are collected, resources can be expended (at Banshee) to customize the perk configuration on the weapon they found them on. This weapon can then be purchased and reconfigured at will. This does two things:

1. Reworks Banshee as an actual gunsmithing vendor. What is Banshee best at? Working on that Auto Rifle for 4 years. Now imagine if that Auto Rifle was your unique gun. Neat huh? Want a different scope/barrel/or damage perk on that gun you love? Well based on what you’ve discovered, Banshee has you covered.
2. Shifts the focus of Destiny’s reward system from a grindy rage against the lottery machine to a less grindy, but more customizable system. This new system offers more ways to play and enjoy your favorite guns, while preserving the progress you’ve made with them (sunset or not).

Do I have your attention? Good.

**Gunsmithing with Banshee**

In this new gunsmithing role, Banshee becomes the center of collecting weapons and perks in Destiny. No longer will players have overflowing vaults full of multiple guns with different rolls. Banshee keeps track of all these elements for you. When a gun is first unlocked/collected, it appears in the Gunsmith and those perks are considered the default configuration of that weapon. Receiving another copy of the same weapon unlocks that copy’s perks in the perk configuration process at the Gunsmith. Here is a rough flow:

1. Players interact with Banshee and enter the Gunsmith hub. There are three sub-categories at the Gunsmith: Raid Weapons, Legendary Weapons, and Sunset Weapons.

[Gunsmith New Title Screen](https://imgur.com/h7akeze)

2. Selecting a sub-category of weapons brings the player to a collection of weapons filled with the guns they have collected/unlocked during gameplay. Here players can hover over a choice weapon and do one of two things:

a. Purchase the existing configuration of that weapon for enhancement cores and glimmer (and maybe gunsmith components).

b. Edit the existing configuration of that weapon.

[Gunsmith Legendary Weapons Category](https://imgur.com/IfvEHFg)

3. ***If Edit Configuration*** is selected, players are brought to the selected weapon’s edit screen. Here players can select various perks (for a small cost) and swap them for other perks they have collected from obtaining other copies of that weapon. Once a perk is purchased, that perk becomes part of the default perk configuration of that weapon in the Gunsmith. Greyed out perks indicate that perk has yet to be obtained from a random roll.

[Perk Configuration Edit Example 1](https://imgur.com/0QjKiBX)

**NOTE:** Keen readers can see that, in this proposed system, PvE and PvP kills are now both tracked inherently by the gunsmith. These kills can be seen on all rolls of a weapon once it has unlocked kill tracking at least once through masterworking.

[Perk Configuration Edit Example 2](https://imgur.com/42ZDZjc)

**NOTE:** Barrel and magazine/round perks can also be swapped out!

4. Players also have the option to swap out the existing masterwork mod with any other previously discovered masterworks (found on other random rolls). Progress on masterworking each mod is tracked. If a player decides to change things up and exchange their current masterwork for another, their progress on the first mod is preserved. Once an alternate masterwork is purchased, that mod becomes part of the default perk configuration of that weapon in the Gunsmith.

[Perk Configuration Masterwork Edit Example](https://imgur.com/6qAG5yN)

**Sunsetting**

In this system, when Bungie sunsets weapons, they are removed from the Legendary Weapons category and added to the Sunset Weapons category.

In the Sunset Weapons category, weapon perk configuration, kill tracking, and masterwork progression works the same way. When Bungie decides to re-issue weapons, the gunsmith preserves discovered perks, masterwork progress, and kill tracking. This way, players that have invested the time in completing a weapon before it was sunset only have to farm the weapon for its new perks (if added) instead of “re-completing” it.

This system also allows players to continue farming for perks they may have missed when a weapon was in the loot pool. Each undiscovered perk can be purchased after completing a specific PvE or PvP kill requirement. This system would help alleviate FOMO as all players would have access to the best roll of a weapon even after it has been sunset.

[Perk Configuration Sunset Weapon Example](https://imgur.com/Rjl1v4X)

**Shifting Systems**

Grinding for that perfect roll is the core of Destiny’s gameplay. Players always desire the perfect tool for any given situation. This new perk customization system would allow players to collect the best perks for any given weapon while also allowing for customization and experimentation with ease. In this system, no perk should feel as though it is settled upon, but instead chosen for the proper situation or encounter. This provides a more meaningful representation of choice as a player collects and unlocks loot in Destiny. 

A system focused on completing weapons would make every weapon feel like a pinnacle quest when completing its perk tree. It would give every gun an “end-in-sight” for grinding.

**Closing Thoughts**

Destiny can either be desired to be played because it demands a lot from a player, or it can be desired to be played because it has a lot of alluring ways to play. The current system leans more into the former; Almost to the point where players could have an unhealthy connection to the game due to the attention it demands. A system like the one proposed above could provide a better balance between completionism and RNG, as well as respects the player’s past progression as weapons are re-issued."

1,"Bungie, you’ve said that “how it feels” feedback is helpful. Well, in Gambit, I feel powerless.","Far too often in Gambit my guardian feels powerless both in the sense I am weak and ineffectual against enemies and invaders, and also in the sense that it feels like I have very little agency to be able to affect the game. 

**Examples**

I feel powerless against an invader with wallhacks, overshield and a seemingly infinite supply of one-shot heavy ammo.

I feel powerless when I can barely damage the adds in the latter waves because I can’t get any special or heavy drops and my primary barely damages the yellow bars.

I feel powerless to impact the outcome of the match when there are several blockers on the bank and my team won’t help me kill them or when my teammate is running around trying to get 15 motes when we are 3 away from primeval.

I feel powerless to fight the enemies when they are teleporting around me. 

I feel powerless when I do kill a bunch of enemies and half the motes fall under the map. 

I feel powerless when I’m against a 4-stack that can melt the Primeval as soon as it spawns with 4x Thundercrash or Chaos Reach.

I feel powerless when I get snowballed by the *blocker - invade - wipe* loop that is far too common. 

**Suggested Solutions**

It’s clear the gamemode needs an overhaul, and I don’t really have any specific solutions, but I do feel these three areas are most in need of being reworked:

1.	Ammo economy, particularly the availability of heavy ammo. I won’t list invasion as a separate point because I feel like a lot of the issues with invasion stem from heavy availability
2.	The ‘flow’  of matches that leads to snowballing and being piled with blockers and invasions
3.	The ability to instantly melt the primeval if your team is co-ordinated 

In addition to that, teleporting enemies, motes glitching under the map and mote pickup need to be sorted out. 

I do feel the mode has the potential to be fun and unique but it just doesn’t feel good or fun to play just now.  I’ve played it a lot - I got Reckoner and Dredgen and am close to gilded Dredgen - and the current state of it is definitely the worst it’s been."

1,What is the best way to get glimmer? Is there a way to farm it?,I wanna buy a weapon from the lost monument thingy and I have everything except the glimmer.. what's the fastest way I can get some glimmer?
1,"Upcoming changes to stasis/ freeze abilities, questions and concerns...","First off,  read the post.

So, I'm curious as to why titans and warlocks get to retain an instant freeze melee ability, while the hunters are not only losing the ability to freeze, but also aim assist and damage?

I get that the hunter melee has too much tracking as it is now, and changing that is perfectly fine, the damage reduction is also fine as 90 damage is a bit much. However the issue is that most hunters don't run around with both melee charges up, and now that using both melee charges will no longer result In a freeze, that becomes an issue..

I don't want to hear about how it still slows people, that's bs, the slowed person can still fight back, where as the frozen opponent cannot.

All 3 classes have access to each grenade, so that's irrelevant in this conversation. 

The issue is balance, warlocks get an instant freeze tracking melee, titans will retain their cheap melee.. hunters seem to be getting screwed pretty hard in terms of the melee ability. 

This has nothing to do with salt, or anything outside of balance, it just seems to go against balancing when 2 classes still retain an ability to INSTANTLY freeze vs throwing 2 shurikens and still not freezing. 

Another example of bungie not knowing how to properly balance something and nerfing it into the ground. 


And onto topic 2, the class ability, TWO slides for titans with a cool down, TWO icarus dashes for warlocks with a cool down... ONE dive for hunters with a cool down. 

I get that hunters can shatter crystals with it, but so can titans with the slide,  and mainly both are used as a movement technique.. so why not 2 shatters for hunters? Keep everything even???"

Is it  supposed to be this unbalanced?

Is this what Bungie calls balance or am I just really unlucky with the team composition?"
1,I'd be less miffed about the Chaos Reach nerf if so many Warlock subclasses weren't nerfed into the ground already,"I get that it's wonky that Chaos Reach seems to ignore walls sometimes if you're near a corner, or something. That is indeed BS.

I get that if they changed it (unintentionally?) so that even dying while currently doing your Lightning Kamehameha refunds you Super energy, that is also BS. Dying while using it should mean you have zero super energy when you respawn again, since it's not like it's hard to cancel early anyway. If you catch a Warlock mid-Super, they should get punished.

But a flat nerf to Super energy refunded when you successfully cancel hurts when *holy fuck why do I think I've defaulted to Chaos Reach so much in the first place?*

Voidwalker: Who even think this is good anymore? Top tree, the grenades take forever to charge up for benefits that are less threatening than Duskfield is naturally--and I don't honestly expect that to change even after the nerfs. An overcharged Vortex grenade only kills Guardians if they just don't react to it. An overcharged Axion does good damage but is easily dodged. Scatter can't ever be relied upon, period.

Slowva Bomb, well, is slow enough that some Supers just kill you first or can dodge it before it even hits the ground.

Bottom tree is very risk/reward, if you're godly you can go on killstreaks with Devour, but you lose all value if you eat a grenade and just die instantly to a special weapon or Super or whatever. I can't remember the last time a Warlock killed me and instantly healed because they had Devour going, it's just not used except by some streamers.

Middle tree? A complete disgrace. It's bad, and it's even more awful that it's been allowed to be that way for so long. Nova Warp takes so long to charge up its attacks for a Super that has to get into shotgun range to that it's comical, and HHSN is kind of a joke now.

Dawnblade: Top tree remains great. Got that going, at least...

Middle tree, just no. If you want be meme-y and play Healer by equipping Lumina and throwing healing grenades at your friends, go ahead, but it's a meme. Nobody uses Well of Radiance tree in Crucible for serious business.

Bottom tree Dawnblade is like middle tree Voidwalker, it's disgusting how awful it is. It's great in PvE *but only with Dawn Chorus* which is another travesty; nerfing something into the ground and then un-nerfing it with an Exotic is a band-aid on a deep wound. Now the subclass is locked into an Exotic choice.

But in Crucible it remains terrible, you have *nothing* useful until your Super is online, and even then, it's not even the best Super around anyway. It's frankly the most boring subclass in the game, the **one** unique action you can perform in your neutral game is to...awkwardly dive towards the ground to heal a bit. Fun?

Stormcaller: Top tree has been pretty dead in Crucible as well. Your Stormtrance gets laughed at by Silence and Squall, Glacial Quake, and Shadebinder. Your Arc Web-boosted grenades are again, less threatening than Stasis abilities. There's precious little reason to pick this. 

Bottom tree: See top tree, but it's even worse since it can't Ionic Blink, has even worse grenades and melees, and Arc Souls are laughable.

Mid tree: Like top tree Dawnblade, well at least we have this going for us. Being able to spam a Super as simple as Chaos Reach makes up for a lot. Grenades are default, melee is a bit meh, but at least you can use them a bit more often and have more Supers than other Warlock subclasses. One that can shut down ground-based Supers pretty well or just give a ""fuck you in particular"" to 1-2 enemies in sight and then shut it off to preserve some energy.

**Conclusion**: For a long, *long* time I've seen exactly two Warlock subclasses in the Crucible--Attunement of Sky and Attunement of Control--because the rest are outclassed or remain nerfed into sorry states, and now one of those is getting a nerf as well because Warlocks can't have nice things, I guess.

Like I said, if I felt like Warlock *had* several other options, I'd be less miffed about the Chaos Reach nerf. Which I suspect is mostly because of a certain Elimination playlist which has become so passive and campy that some fireteams do nothing but watch their cooldowns, thus making anything that Supers more often feel too powerful as a result.

If Chaos Reach must get punished because of one playlist with 1% of the player population actually participating in it, can other subclass trees get some actual love? Maybe there's so much Chaos Reach in all playlists because Warlocks feel *bottlenecked into it* due to lack of viable choices.

Top tree Dawn, Chaos Reach, everything else basically sucks."

By allowing us to earn previous seasons ornaments(I'm looking at you season of the hunt warlock set) we won't have fomo.

I was thinking we could make a system where the new weekly bounty system extends to previous seasons. so if I do a weekly challenge from the season of the hunt I level up on the season of the hunt&amp;chosen passes . while if I do a season of chosen challenge I rank up for only season of the chosen.

We already have the weekly challenges system built in to our ui just extend this for previous seasons as well please.

This will help people who bought the season pass who ended up feeling burnt out. This also benefits the players who just don't have enough time to play the game. This new system will help all players and help reduce fomo and burnout. As now I can do challenges over a longer amount of time knowing I can do them later on.

I can't imagine implementing an umbral focus option on re-issued weapons would be a big deal."
1,Something I'd love to see make an appearance in Destiny,"An expansion centred around actually being a Guardian. It could be set in a large, interconnected planet, with different landscapes, like a city in ruins as a middle zone, with multiple exits into the different zones, hollowed out buildings etc. Inside one or two zones is a populated Human settlement, this brings a new type of patrol and Public Event; 'Escort' and 'Defence'.

In the lore, Guardians escort civilians to the Last City, right? Well, 'Escort' would be about escorting Human survivors to another zones Landing Zone, to be taken to the Last City. During your escort, you are ambushed by Fallen, Hive or Cabal, with each ambush party being spearheaded by a yellow bar. Kill all the yellow bars before you reach the landing zone and you begin the Heroic patrol, which sees the transport ship being shot out the sky, and it turns into a king of the hill type situation where you hold a zone for a set number of minutes. Holding the zone will result in a mission clear and some unique cosmetic rewards, like a new shader (Purple Feather), which looks like Saint-14 feathers.

Then we have 'Defence', when the public event starts, our Ghost could say something along the lines of;

""Guardian, a nearby settlement has sent out a distress call. Let's check it out, shall we?""

Essentially, you take your sparrow to the settlement and see it being overwhelmed by enemies. You clear it out, then hold the line, with enemies spawning in waves at four different sides (Think of the Exo challenge where you're holding the point against waves of Vex, but with all four sides). To activate the Heroic version, you have to destroy the enemys transport ship. Completing it could reward a unique emblem ""Saviour"".

The settlement idea could even bring new items. Think of it like a Wild West settlement, where you enter the tavern and purchase drinks/items that give you heavy ammo (Like D1s Heavy Ammo Synths), or even some silly, gimmicky cosmetics like a fedora or something cliché-y cowboy/gunslinger centred. The more patrols and Public Events you do in that zone/planet, the more reputation you gain. The higher the reputation, the lower the price for items, and maybe even an Exotic quest for a western-inspires armour/weapon.

I just want to experience what a Guardian is meant to be doing, helping civilians survive and taking them to the City. We only ever read about Guardians doing that, or reading about settlements like Palamon. I'd like to experience it."

1,We desperately need more Legendary special weapons in the Kinetic slot,"I'd been dragging my ass on continuing to do the Deep Stone Crypt raid, finally did it again last night and got Heritage, which is great.

So what this means if I want to use an Exotic energy primary like Riskrunner, or Sunshot, or Ticuu's Divination, or Trinity Ghoul, etc my choices are now:

* Heritage
* Long Shadow
* shitty Toil and Trouble

Hell, the main reason I needed to do DSC was to get Heritage because until then, Exotic energy primaries felt almost unusable because I didn't have a good special weapon to pair them with.

Sure, there are a few others, like Astral Horizon (probably inaccessible to many players simply because they don't want to play that mode). And there's Exotics like Witherhoard, Bastion, and Arbalest but those are unavailable if your energy weapon or heavy is Exotic.

Point being we desperately need more options for Legendary kinetic special weapons. More sniper rifles but especially more shotguns and grenade launchers would be amazing. (Too bad we'll probably never get fusion rifles in that slot that aren't Exotic.)

It's probably moot to say this, but I still will be REALLY disappointed if we get more loot and there's not several kinetic special weapons that are legendary. I just hope that's already in the works."

Shadowkeep new light had me going to each planet to complete quests that were self contained to each of those places, like little stories to get you used to the area. only issue I had with it was no cutscenes tying it all together.

1,Exotic Warhammer concepts,"A lot of people want Warmhammers as weapons so i made a few concepts on perks for exotic Warhammers :)

First off,how would Warhammers be? Warhammers would be the same as swords but also the opposite. They would be melee weapons that have a slower ""rate of fire"" but will do significantly more damage in exchange due to their size. 


(Concept 1)
Name: Skullcrusher.

Skullcrusher is an exotic Hive-looking warhammer artifact with the exotic perk ""Death to All"".

Death to All: Doing 5 light attacks will charge up it's perk. Doing a heavy attack will activate it's perk,causing a strong shockwave around you which will kill smaller enemies and damage bigger ones. It's great for crowd control as well as for additional boss damage.



(Concept 2)
Name: Mjolnir

Donar is an exotic Warhammer with the exotic perk ""Thunder's Fury"".

Thunder's Fury: Heavy attacks will shoot a lightning rather than do a ground slam. 

This inspiration comes mainly from my love of Tomb Raider games with ""Tomb Raider: Underworld"" being the main inspiration since in this game,you go around the world to find Thor's gauntlets and hammer and get to use the Hammer against enemies. I also got this inspiration when i was doing Pit of Heresy and noticed that the Hive artifact reminds me a lot of Excalibur from Tomb Raider:Legend where both are ""rusty""/old artifacts that are able to send a green shockwave attack.


More ideas for Exotic hammers but i don't have any names:

-A Stasis Warhammer that is like the Titan stasis super slam attack. Press and hold a certain button to activate the perk but this will make you spend more ammo when doing a heavy attack.

-A void Warhammer which will spawn a ""black hole"" upon a heavy attack that ""sucks in"" nearby enemies into the hole(similar to a Duskfield grenade but it won't slow you down). This attack is useful for crowd control when you wanna get multiple ads in a small area and finish them all off with a Warhammer attack.

-A solar Warhammer that will do a spin attack,causing an area of effect fire cirle around you."

1,Is this week the easiest version to solo flawless harbinger?,[removed]
1,Infamy rank up challenge bugged?,Earn 10000 infamy and no progress.
1,Ideas for buffing some under performing exotics,"    Sleeper Simulant: all linear fusions need a damage buff, sleeper most of all. But as the ultimate warmind weapon, sleeper needs something extra. New perks: kills with this weapon generate warmind cells, multiple precision hits generate warmind cells, and holding reload generates a pulse which detonates all warmind cells in its radius. The idea here is to improve total damage and add clear potential while feeding into its identity as a warmind weapon.
    Acrius and darci: these should be made into special weapons. Acrius will never be able to composted with swords and darci will never be able to compete with Whisper. Putting them in the special category could allow them to find a place in the game where they would otherwise continue to sit unused.
    Merciless: this should become a pvp focused exotic. Change the perk to increases chafe rate on a kill, until you next reload (including things like hunters dodge and transversive steps). This would allow it to become a fun exotic in the crucible. You would first have to gather enough social to load its magi zone to full, and then get 2+ kills to start it ramping up, but once you did it would shred the next 4 to 5 targets you come across. Obviously this would render it useless for dps, but nobody really uses it for that right now anyways. But we could use a fusion rifle that rewards good gameplay
    Two tailed fox: catalyst which grants the perk kitsune: adds a third arc rocket with the special effect that enemies killed by it generate a massive arc explosion. Think warmind cell detonation size and damage. 
     Prospector: change the perk to this: shots fired from this weapon stick to their target dealing no damage, hold reload to detonate all stuck projectiles. Damage is increased per stuck projectile.  So you stick a bunch of bombs to your target then detonate them for huge damage."

1,Give us back higher stat armor from raids. 56 total is not and will never be acceptable for raids.,"Prophecy and PoH can drop 60+ stat rolled gear. Why is the endgame IP defining activity not dropping gear worth my time? Players shouldn’t be getting gear from raids that would drop in a strike.

I don’t know why this change was made but it has completely belittled raid loot for me."
1,"As a former Destiny player from the outside looking in, here's what I think should change","I recently saw all this stuff about being able to do a 12 man raid, and how the community went wild for it. I think there should be a huge change to the way raids work.

For all of destiny, it has been 6 guys, kill bad guys, kill 3-4 big bad guys, win. 

I think for the next raid they should do something way different, like a 9 man raid, or perhaps a simulation raid, where zavala builds a simulation machine to train the guardians for what is to come in the final DLCs.

 I think it capitalises on people loving more than 6 people in the raid, and it puts a different twist on how raids work while also building hype for the final DLCs."
1,"Is the triumph ""light seeker"" still bugged?","I know they said they fixed it, and I already seen some posting pics of it completed. But for me, it is bugged.

Does anyone know where I could find some decent people that will help me through some team based missions. I want to do prophecy for the ikelos shotgun and the shadow keep dungeon for Xenophage. Also I’ve played since d1 and have never completed a raid lol. Any help greatly appreciated. Oh and I play on Xbox. Thanks.
1,Add Quickdraw to the Astral Horizon’s perk pool,"Now that the ‘older’ Astral Horizon will no longer be sunset, the new one is simply inferior. I completely understand moving away from Quickdraw as a perk on aggressive shotguns, but my issue lies with inability to *get* arguably the most important perk on what may be the best shotgun in the game (likely after Felwinter’s gets tuned). 

Surplus is an okay perk, but as a replacement for Quickdraw, it just doesn’t measure up. I’d suggest simply replacing Surplus with Quickdraw for Astral. 

And again, I’m not trying to advocate for Quickdraw on aggressive frame shotguns. Rather, I think that if we’re going to have such an incredibly compelling weapon/perk combination available for use in end-game PvP activities, everyone should have the opportunity to get one."

1,"The lost bird ""Where. Is. Crow."" //My own Lore// please read//","   In the wake of the land tank on Nessus plunged by masses of Guardians, an idle Osiris is look at the sky from the Bazaar amd wonders in his head, what if Crow is right and Caital is merely just pressured by tradition and the honor the Cabal have. Ikora asks him from her spot ""Osiris, what was it like, lossing your light and"" she paused then finished ""Sagira"" 

     Osiris reached into his pocket and took out a broken, and lightless Sagira. 

     ""Like a sudden death wish, one that takes time to pass into fruition. I had forgotten the fear of death, but now I am reacquainted with my old enemy, one that the traveler can not redo all due to Xivu Arath and her High Celebrant"" he sets the broken, and lightless Sagira down on a table and walks to Ikora. 

     ""You done this city well, so has Zavala, the late Cayde-6, and so has the Guardian. A new ally I am sure you have heard of, Crow. Has helped us with dealing with Caital amd her army of Cabal, I even assigned him as Zavala's personal bodyguard, as though well I not fit anymore for such tasks, the death of me by a Legionary or even a Psion would mean the death of Zavala as well"" he pauses 

      Ikora reaches out and pulls her ghost out 
""Osiris, we will find a way to give you your light back"" 
   Osiris sighs ""It's not the light that I want back, although as understandable it would be to want it back. The bond between me amd Sagira, was much stronger then the light and I, when Sagira was destoryed, I felt a pain much worse then lossing the light, I in such a long time had felt the pain of death of a loved one"" Osiris looks away to cover his tear ""It's not the same without Sagira"" 

     Ikora reaches her hand out to hold Osiris's hand to reassure him that those who care for him still exist, Osiris spoke again 
   
     ""Thank you"" he then asks Ikora another question ""The skull above lord Shaxx, that is an Ahamkara is it not"" Ikora nods yes ""Savathûn is likely watching from the skull, the drifter mentioned Shaxx sang a tune that Eris heard on the moon"" Ikora steps back 

      ""What is it"" Osiris asked 
      Osiris then feels his heart race and has a heart attack, he falls and curls, Ikora yells for a medic but no one is there, the sky turns blood red and Savathûn appears over the Traveler and with a flick it breakes the traveler into pieces 

     ""You! Are merely a puppet of the light Miss Ikora Ray. I am a GOD, I am the destruction of Sol"" Savathûn reaches his arm out and with a swipe destorys the whole last city, bodies fling everywhere dismembered, yelling out too Ikora to help them, but Ikora couldn't do anything she was restrained by a force 

     ""Hello light creature"" Xivu Arath says as the God of War morphs into a familar face ""Do you wish to die as well wielder of light"" Ikora screams and then she see's the face, it is Uldren Sov and he is carrying a body on his back ""Do you remember me Ikora, the poor lightless guardian that lost his sister cause of your guardians messing with things they shouldn't mess with, thanks to your kind my sister is dead, I am dea-"" Uldren stops speaking and Xivu Arath morphs into Crow 

     ""If only Cayde 6 were here"" Crow says, and Ikora breaka free and punches Crow, the vision ends to realize she punched Osiris 

      ""You were silent there for a good while there Ikora what happend"" Osiris held his cheek with his palm, and Ikora was showing a face of immense anger ""Ikroa what vision did you have"" she looked him dead in the eyes 


      ""Where. Is. Crow."" She said and Osiris went silent.
     
      ""Where. Is. CROW"" she yelled and pushed Osiris against the floor, Drifter heard the commotion as he walking into the Bazaar and ran to Ikora and Osiris 
  
       ""What are you doin' sista, this is a public place"" he then saw her face ""Oh oh, this ain't good"" and he seperates Ikora from Osiris ""Calm down the both of you"" 

     ""Where. Is. Crow."" Ikora looked to Drifter instead ""I have got no clue lady"" she looked at Osiris ""Where. Is. Crow."" Ikora pulled out a hand cannon and pointed it at Osiris ""Ikora please"" Osiris was scared ""Crow is in the H.E.L.M"" he quickly said ""I would like to see Crow"" Ikora said and Osiris nodded ""I would like to speak to"" she grew anger ""Uldren Sov"" Osiris's face grew pale as snow and lightheaded, and showed Ikora the way. 

      Drifter watched Osiris walk Ikora from the Bazaar to the H.E.L.M. and walked to Osiris's spot, and saw Sagira and hold her shell, Eris might know how to perform a Séance on you little buddy"" he transmats out."

I can understand Bungie vaulting things for new players but it is annoying when what seems to be an amazing worth of storytelling just sat there and I can't experience. It would be good to see Red War and locations return even if only for story purposes, like Forsaken things being sunset, you can experience the story, just no good items or anything of the like will come of it

1,"How the Omnioculus is The Best Exotic to Use For All Endgame Team Content Including Grandmasters, and Why You Should Love Bottom Tree Void | Hunter Build","If you haven't gotten the omnioculus as of yet for the hunter, then you are missing out big time in terms of what it can offer for both top, middle or bottom tree void. Currently With the omnioculus, if you combine it with Rat King and reload per kill with it you can gain a good chunk of charged melee energy back and thus have unlimited invisibility at your disposal but also get around a 50% damage reduction while invisible. This can be viable for a number of content where you and your team would like to survive very hectic situations or better off, mess around with a team of three to six who have the same loadout as you.

That's actually quite a scary thought the more I think about it.

Unfortunately, Bungies recent TWAB has mentioned that the Rat king and Omnioculus combo will be patched and thus put a end to a completely nutty build.

However, that doesn't mean the exotic as a whole becomes useless and I've found that the best way to make this up is to simply have Way of the Pathfinder and Elemental Well mods for a very nice team focused setup.

**Subclass**: Way of the Pathfinder

**Exotic**: Omnioculus

**Primary**: Rat King (Until it goes)

**Secondary**: Orewing Maul or Any Void With Wellspring or Demolitionist

**Heavy**: Any

**Mods**

**Head** \- Ashes to Assets and Font of Wisdom mod.

**Arm** \- Bolstering Detonation x2 and High Energy Fire mod

**Chest** \- Concussive Dampener x2 and Elemental Ordnance mod

**Leg** \- Absolution, Invigoration and Radiant Light mod

**Cloak**\- Distribution, Bomber and Blast Radius mod

**What Does it All do?**

With the rat king included with the setup you can be become a team supporter by providing your team with unlimited invisibility, unlimited heart of the pack buff and can provide Elemental Wells for boosting there abilities further and if they have EW mods as well then they can greatly benefit from it.

Without the rat king it will still be the same but, you have more room of flexibility and you can still achieve the same level of melee regen even with out the exotic in mind, and all you need to do is heavily crutch on your grenades.

You see, from the subclass tree your offered two perks tat will strongly improve the build by a lot. Lockdown will increase your grenade duration for longer while combat provision will provide grenade energy from making allies invisible and melee energy from damaging them. All you really need to do is have a high Discipline stat say 60 to 70 and then have a weapon with the Demolitionist perk and just spam your grenades till the end of time and thus can have unlimited invisibility as well.

To play it safe for high end content having a high strength stat wouldn't hurt either as your getting a faster cooldown from them as well. If you have the radiant light mod then do by all means add it in and go from there but if not, have a wellspring weapon on hand or better off, don't. Either way the build will do you well for Dungeons solo or Nightfall's especially if you have a team who know what there doing but are also using team based abilities to keep everyone stacked.

This is why having elemental well mods are very powerful when you focus heavily in them. Of course, warmind cells and Charged With Light are still favourable but the synergy alone from the mods are interesting.

1,Sunday Plz - Add Strike Specific Loot to Playlist Strikes,"Greetings Guardians!

Ever since the conception of this sub, we've dealt with floods of reposts. We’re sure you’re familiar with them. Many are for important issues that are shared by the entire player base, while others are just for personal requests and desires for the game. The [Bungie Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) was shortly implemented after conception as a central ""wish-list"" for all that we, the community, desired. It is *completely* user driven. With rare exceptions, nearly all submissions are sent in by you, the users of this subreddit!

However, just like Destiny 2, our wiki article began to experience problems as it grew over time. It's been getting just a few sizes too big. We understand that the continued addition of topics has begun to encroach on your ability to continue the conversation towards matters that mean the most to you, and even though [the Bungie Plz has seen so many successes over the years, **with well over 100 officially implemented game suggestions and desires**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz#wiki_completed_in_destiny_2.21), there's still dozens upon dozens of retired topics that haven't seen the light of day for many months...even years!

---

Every Sunday, this thread will focus on a certain retired Bungie Plz topic **of your choosing, voted by the users.** We will curate a list of 5 suggestions to help focus your voting process, **but you get the final say** on what is talked about each week. By all means, if one topic is overwhelmingly desired despite not being part of those 5 items we picked, then we'll be happy to go with that one. Our curated list is only to help you focus the conversation. The only stipulation is that the topic must be new every week. This thread is for the entirety of the Bungie Plz wiki, so no back-to-back voting!

Think of these threads as a way to keep the spark alive, and to bring old topics up to fresh light. For example, do we still want to move Queenbreaker to the special slot? Or does Arbalest serve that purpose well enough now? Do we still want an all-black shader, or do we want a character barbershop more?

You tell us! This is your conversation, guardians.

For this week, you voted on:

#Add The Nightfall Strike Specific Loot to Playlist Strikes

For next week, here are some suggestions:

* Increase Vault Size
* Make Warlock bonds more cosmetically distinct and appealing
* Add a Crucible mode without Heavy and/or Supers
* Display Light Level/Power Level instead of season pass rank
* Veteran Dialogue option for PC players (and console)

Sound off in the sticky comment for which one sounds good (just give us a moment to put it up), or [anything else in the Bungie Plz wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) that catches your eye, and we'll do our best to accommodate!

By changing the stack count from x10 to x100, Bungie can bring in more smaller sources of stasis.... say a LMG that shoots stasis bullets that gives you x2 stacks each for example. It’s probably gonna be hell in crucible unless they fix a lot of penalities inflicted by slow but I can see how this can be the way legendary stasis weapons are implemented"

However a weapon that can wipe a team with a single rocket goes untouched?

After researching through different posts I learned you can only get a new note weekly. 

As I had just gotten my first note today does that mean that I am locked out of getting the title?

 I know the triumph will last all year and that I just wouldn't get to get a pin for the title but I wasn't sure what the difference of having the pin with the title was compared to just a title. I had originally aimed for the title to be able to display it under my username and in my character page."

&gt; Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124


With the way Warmind Cells currently work, *(on a point-based per kill system),* we can currently walk into a room knowing the exact moment we are spawning a Cell, &amp; instantly clear out everything in sight apart from Yellow Bars &amp; some Orange Bar enemies.

I absolutely adore running them, but you can't deny that with the ability to set off chain-reacting **nukes**, we've reached the absolute epitome of ""Power Creep"".


Warmind Cells can currently do all of the following:
-

Solar Mods:

- Apply a Solar Damage DoT with Damage so pathetically low it literally kills nothing, BUT will pop every Solar Shield it touches.

- Heal everyone in the radius by a large portion of Health &amp; Shields.

- *(Charges you with light upon defeating multiple enemies.)*

- *(Rapidly defeating enemies with a Cell drops an Orb of Power.)*

- *(Cell does +50% more Damage as Solar, diminishing outwards with range until it does 0%.)*

- Solar Splash Damage generates a Cell.

Void Mods:

- Shooting a Cell fires an outward wave that Stuns/Blinds all enemies. Can be applied multiple times with 1 Cell.

- Pick-up a Cell to take it anywhere you want apart from through loading zones.

- Charges you with light when killing enemies around a Cell, but not with it.

- Provide you a Damage Boost which stacks with a Buff &amp; Debuff. (For example, Power of Rasputin stacks with Bubble/Tether)

- Cell duration lasts longer.

- Provide you a passive 50% Damage Reduction where ever you put the Cell.

Arc Mods:

- Reduce kills needed to make a Cell.

- Physically boop enemies far away like Lucio with a shockwave.

- Chain lightning if you ""collect"" the Cell. Great at popping shields, but not killing things in huge areas.

- Provide a strong regenerative Overshield.

- Grant Melee energy.

- Charge you with light if you collect it.


Warmind Cells can already provide a TON of utility if modded properly.
-


If we removed the damage they did entirely, we'd only need the 3 Solar Mods I left in parenthesis, as nothing else requires you kill an enemy.

- Incinerating Light can be changed to ""Charge you with Light"" when you shoot the Cell, as opposed to killing enemies.

- Light of the Fire can be changed to just drop the Orb of Power when the Cell is destroyed.

- Rage of the Warmind can be changed to... well anything. I'm fond of an effect such as ""Shooting a Warmind Cell staggers Enemies &amp; *(maybe)* champions"", or something like ""shooting a Cell provides an average Damage Boost to any allies near it"".

Because they'd no longer nuke planets, I'd also change/remove Global Reach.
-

- Turn Global Reach into a mod called ""Cell Activation"" which allows any Legendary Weapon to create **AND** Damage Warmind Cells. 

(Shooting a Cell without this would simply hit ""Immune"". Collecting would be unchanged as you need a mod to do that already, but you couldn't generate them yourself without it equipped).

- Make the ""Global Reach range"", default range.

- Increase the cost to 3.

This promotes weapon diversity, stops the complaints of people shooting them with no mods, &amp; gives Warmind Cells the same ""Green Mod / Taking Charge"" required treatment that CWL sets have. 

If allowing any Legendary Weapon is too strong, they can increase the number of kills required to make one, &amp; even buff ""Blessing of Rasputin"" to make it a more attractive choice.



TLDR of the post &amp; my reasoning,
-

TLDR of the Post,

- Keeping in mind the huge amount of Utility &amp; the 4 Mod changes I suggested, would you still use Warmind Cells if they did 0 Damage by default but you could generate them with any Legendary Weapon?

My Reasoning for the suggestion, 

- Removing the damage entirely would let Ad-Clear Weapons, Supers, &amp; etc shine again.

- No longer locked to a small sub-section of Weapons for an entire build.

- Content won't have to be balanced around players being able to kill/damage the entire map from one spot. *(Aka we could actually get a horde-mode-like activity that won't be trivialized by 1 person in the team).*

- Promotes more team/tactical &amp; creative use of their Utility-based Mods like Cellular Suppression, etc.

1,Active player count for the coming Guardian games event,"TL;DR for Guardian games, base the active player count off of the number of players turning in medals, as that would instantly be an accurate count of the number of players participating. 

Guardian games is coming up and the hot toxic mess that was last year's event is still fresh in memory. Looking back participation was really the biggest problem with the event, especially for hunters. Hunters were given a handicap based on the numbers bungie had for the active player count, but it became clear when they put out the numbers toward the end that a lot of hunters just didn't participate at all during the event. I bring this up because there have been leaks about guardian games and i already see players saying they're not going to participate due to what we have seen being focused on pve. So i propose basing the active player count off of the actual number of players participating. Until a player turns in a medal, they aren't counted, and once they do, they are. I admit I don't know how much effort it would take to do this and it might not be feasible, but I think it should be considered."

1,Some questions from someone who hasn’t played Destiny since 2017.,"Hey everyone. Recently picked up Destiny again after quite a while away. I played D1 religiously but gave up on D2 early on because I personally didn’t like where it was at back then. The game has changed tremendously and I’m figuring out many things on my own, but I’m having trouble figuring out some things even with google at my fingertips. Feel free to give any advice you feel necessary to a new(ish) player on top of the questions listed below. So here goes...

Main: Titan ~1270 light (have other two classes as well)

What’s the current meta for guns/perks in PvE? How about PvP?

Is there anything I should focus on doing (other than raids) to get certain weapons such as the Falling Guillotine, etc.? What guns/events should I be trying to “farm?”

I had left over silver and bought the Celestial Titan ornament package from Tess. How do these work? Are they reusable, or once they’re on a piece of armor I can never use it again? Don’t want to put it on future obsolete gear and waste money.

Is focusing engrams really necessary or is it for if I’m searching for a specific piece of armor/gun? That whole aspect confuses me a little lol.

Any sweet legendary scout rifles out there?

I’ll end this by saying the Dead Man’s Tale quest and the Prophecy Dungeon were some of the most fun levels in Destiny ever IMO!!

Thanks for the help!"
1,"I don't know how many times it's been asked, but Bungie can you please fix Linear Fusion Rifles?","These guns are actually Hive-God-awful heavy weapons. I have seen next to no one use them. I would never pick an LFR over a grenade launcher/sword/rocket/machine gun.

I go into a strike to do the **literally** **DAILY** Gunsmith LFR bounty (while I'm here and have your attention, daily variety of ALL weapon types bounties would be incredible too, not just the seasonal drop ones) and I can't even one shot a Hive Knight with one, while a single Izanagi (non-honed) can do the job.

Please buff the shit out of these things or turn them all into special weapons like Arbalest because in this state they're literally next to useless."
1,Hawkmoon,I'm trying to get the kills for hawkmoon do guardians count for a bigger percentage?
1,"Avoiding the SBMM debate, Crucible matchmaking is garbage.","THIS IS NOT A POST ABOUT SBMM. While I think SBMM is the better method for matchmaking in video games in general, I understand that it's not coming back to Destiny 2, and I've made my peace with that. But the current system is bullshit.

I just got a cool Bottom Dollar drop from Gambit and decided to jump into a game of Control solo to see how the gun performs. I proceeded to immediately get stomped into oblivion by a 6-stack. I looked at the others on my team and saw no common clan tags, so from my observation, the game basically just put me on a team with 5 other randoms and said ""get fucked"". I turned the game off out of pure frustration.

I don't see how anyone can think this is a good way to fill lobbies, regardless of skill level. Solo queue for Iron Banner was a hugely positive addition to the game, but why is it limited to a game mode we get to play only 1 week per month?

I wish PvP game developers did a better job acknowledging the solo queuers in their games with solo queue options. I frankly don't give a fuck about getting into a game sooner if it means getting mercy'd or having to quit and start searching for a new lobby because I'm getting beat so hard I can't even respawn without dying immediately. I'm not here to speed up a 6-stack's desire for another easy win, I'm here to enjoy myself too.

There are so many problems I have with PvP in Destiny 2, but this one really stuck out to me today because it was such a shitty experience getting a really cool piece of loot only to have any chance to USE it completely negated by an awful PvP match.

Bungie, do better."

Can I get the 2 more entries by running it on different characters or is it account wide?

But no. Let's just woop dee doo da go to the next area, clear the enemies there to get more motes and completely ignore the fact there is AN INVADER on the field with eyes of tomorrow.

And obviously when the other team calls a primeval, watch the boss' bar go down in 10 seconds.

1,Are Citan's Ramparts are still bugged?,"Back when they first came out, it was noted that every once in a while they seem to block or throw off your shots too when you shoot through them. [Video Example and Explaination](https://youtu.be/h9uJkqsnuM0?t=285) 

They also had multiple other bugs, like Devil's Ruin not being able to pass through them at all, and scorch cannons [getting their trajectory distorted in a bizzare way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8yfk64kaX8).

Searching for this I found just one comment saying ""it's fixed now"" with no links or evidence or anything pointing to it being fixed, and just doing some recent testing myself I found the Devil's Ruin bug at the very least still does exist. The blocked shots are the main one i'm worried about and seemed more rare and subtle in some cases and i'm not sure i'd be able to test it in a satisfactory way myself. Is there anything from Bungie (patch notes, comments, etc) talking about this or mentioning a fix for it?"

1,Does Amanda Holliday know who Crow is?,"Recently I have seen more and more friendly interactions between Crow and Amanda, but on one of the recent battlegrounds I did, they started talking about the assassination attempt on Zavala. Holliday mentioned that Zavala was like family and so were people like Ikora and, well, Cayde. Then they talk about how Holliday thinks Cayde's killer got what he deserved etc etc. So I am not sure if Amanda knows the truth but is hiding it from Crow so he does not have a mental breakdown, or does she actually not know who Crow is? Does she know he is the reincarnated body of Uldren but with new light?"
1,Issue with raid players,"My issue is with the raids, specifically the players. The issues stems from the fact that I am mute due to the fact that I have lost my vocal cords in an accident. Because of this I have never been able to play raids in D1 or D2. Recently I have tried to play raids as I have exhausted all other activities in destiny. Whenever I join a raid team and am questioned about why I have no mic and am not speaking I have to inform them that I am mute which almost always leads to me being kicked from the raid, which is the main contributor to why I have never done a raid in Destiny. 

I am asking for ideas as to how I can get around this issue and be able to finally do a raid.
Thanks.

1,Skyburners Oath catalyst update,"Make it have intrinsic anti barrier. It does make sense to do that. Base form pierces cabal shields, and the catalyst does almost nothing for it. Both modes of fire are projectiles, so extra range does next to nothing.

Yes, there’s stuff like aim assist and all that changing based on range, but it still doesn’t do much. Hence, a change to anti barrier being intrinsic.

1,"Now that sunsetting's getting axed, can we reissue...everything?","Armor isn't such a big deal now that we're getting transmog, but the old sets that aren't available anymore should be obtainable in some other manner for the sake of adding them to collections for use in said transmog.

Weapons are what this post is mainly about, though, as many great weapons were left behind due to sunsetting,  and that's cut exorcised most of the stuff in collections. I think everything should be reissued, that means all the loot that's currently in the game (world drops, the old gambit weapons, etc), all the stuff from content that's been retired (Black Armory, Red War, Menagerie, etc.), and even old pinnacle weapons like Mountaintop (because it was a unique weapon that was astoundingly fun to use in PvE, and there is a distinct lack of decent Special weapons in the Kinetic slot that aren't Exotics).

Ada-1 is returning as a vendor for transmog, so maybe we could obtain BA stuff from her somehow, Drifter never left, so all the old Gambit and Joker's Wild weapons could easily be given to him. We'll probably be revisiting the Leviathan at some point during Caiatl's arc to confront Calus, so whatever activity's there we could add the old Raid and Menagerie weapons to. 

In short, there have been *tons* of weapons in Destiny's history, some of them are fun to use, some of them are really effective, some of them look cool, and some are all three. Having nearly all of them rendered unusable like that is tragic, and I think every last one of them is due for a comeback in some form, from some loot source."

1,New crucible mode: LIVE FIRE,"LIVE FIRE: 

  King of the hill objective 
  (One capture point. While this point is captured, you gain 2x points)

    All damage cut in half
   Ability regeneration is 50% slower
   3v3
   Getting a defeat grants health regen
   Snipers are still one shots

   Simple as that, ladies and gentleman. A game mode where you don't get 2 tapped and shotgun rushed.
   
   tldr game mode that is less based around running around, spamming abilities and shotgunning, and more based around strategic movement, team shooting, longer gunfights and defense."

1,1303 drop while base level 1300?,Can someone explain how I got a helmet with power level 1303 while my base level was 1300? I was under the impression that the max power increase you could get from pinnacle drops when at/over 1300 was +2.

1,gambit needs stack protection,"every single game I’ve played against a stack while grinding gambit for the seasonal challenge has been a loss, and has destroyed my win streak because even if I quit from matchmaking I still manage to match with that stack again

I’m tired of this, there needs to be a system that either gets rid of stacks in gambit matching with randoms, or removes win streak penalty when losing to a stack as a solo player"

1,How do I become a potato gamer?,"As the title says, I want to become a potato gamer. I want to see the destiny world through a potato’s eyes. I want to be that 40 year old dad who cries that a gun is too hard to obtain. To all of my fellow potatoes, please give me some advice and tips on how to become potato. Thank you for your time"
1,Is NF ordeal showing “no champions” where modifiers are listed this week for nearly everyone but me?,"Damn man, I ran fallen saber probably 60 times last week, more than half of which on 1270 and did not run into anyone not running any champ mods. This week every single run there is at least one player not running anything and about every other run both players aren’t running any champ mods. So frustrating to HAVE to run sniper or erianas every run because players are running around with double primary and no mods and many of them are 130+ on the pass. Not to mention they will then just ignore champs, pull me forward, and not even let me solo them. Just can’t believe the stupidity I’m seeing this week."

1,Is the Sleeper Simulant removed?,[removed]
1,Two Tailed fox Catalyst ideas,"these are gonna be random different ideas i had

general ideas

* two tailed's void rocket should disrupt, since it is doing half the heavy lifting already
   * [Two tailed fox and overload champion weirdness](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/m4ho3c/two_tailed_fox_an_d_its_weird_overload_interaction/)
* the tracking effects should be updated to be similar to eyes of tomorrow since you can track more then 1 target currently with 2TF

**Idea 1**

* enhanced rockets
   * increased blast radius
      * \+20
   * suppression rocket is an implosion
      * acts like duck field, if your within the AoE youll get ripped into the center
   * solar rocket does more impact damage
   * improved tracking

**Idea 2**

primed and detonated

* holding reload primes the weapons warheads with super energy
   * this Greatly increased blast radius
   * greatly reduces all rocket damage
   * greatly increases effects duration
   * costs 20% of max super energy
* striking an enemy with an normal rocket detonates those struck causing MASSIVE damage and chaining high blast radius explosions to all those affected

**Idea 3 (dont quite like it but need to get it outs my head)**

Mating Pair

* now fires 4 rockets
   * Solar Void Arc and Stasis
   * total damage remains the same reducing individual rocket damage
   * stasis freezes and arc flash bangs
   * fireing patteren is Arc, Void, Stasis, Solar.
      * arc void and stasis combined do 50% of total damage with the final solar rocket doing the remaining 50%
   * yes this would mean you could target 4 different targets

Idea 4

simple prime an detonation

* direct impact with the void then solar releases an large extremely high damage blast

Idea 5

useability buff

* grants vorpal weapon
* grants the following stat buffs
   * \+35 velocity
   * \+25 reload
   * \+20 blast radius

1,Worldshaper ornaments for Izanagis...,Every time I ADS IZA...it feels like I'm hiding inside a Lego monster's mouth...interesting stuff but very inconvenient.
1,Destiny 2 The game with a monetization problem,"So Ive been playing destiny ever since the 2014 beta and later on to destiny 2 during its release until before the launch of shadowkeep. For me I can handle the game going free to play, I can handle having to pay for the expansions but I draw the line at the dang season pass and the vaulting of content.

 1st off the season pass, it literally undercuts the point of the exansions and with the upcoming vog raid to comeback to Destiny 2 in season 14 (probably accesible only through the season pass) whats the point of the bigger expansions. I know Bungie is probably thirsty for cash due to them making destiny 2 free to play but its hard to get into the game if all im seeing is a battlepass to access the content throughout the year ontop of the expansion im not kidding the yearly expansion just feels like a overpriced season in Destiny 2. A way I can see them fixing this is to make the combination of the  annual pass and the expansion together permenant instead of a preorder exclusive purchase and reduce the price to just the expansion price. (On that note am I only one who see's spending $80 for a free to play game who whose gonna remove said content later on for when they feel the game size is too big a bit ridiculous)

 Now onto the content vaulting. I can understand bungie trying reducing the size of the game but literally taking out content and ""potentially"" rotating them in and out of the game without compensating older players  (beta testers at this point for those of us who  played and paid destiny 2 in year 1 up till forsaken)  is just ridiculous I feel personally angry that they dident bother to think of older players like me and it kind of suprise's me that no legal action has been taken against bungie for literally devaluing a product that people thought  wouldent have its content removed. If they were to give players who were playing destiny 2 ever since launch a lifetime pass to all future seasons then yeah i would feel like I got recompensated for the the money that is now in the void of bungie's hard drive's but as it stands now im stuck with less of a game than what i bought into."

1,Flinch needs to be reduced for primary weapons.,I think flinch in general is a shitty mechanic that just punishes precision with how it works in this however I do think it deserves to stay because it serves as a balance for sniper rifles.

1,Hunter - Presage Regular Solo loadout help,"I’m trying to complete the Presage Solo.  I got to the boss today and got it’s damn health down to like 1/8th, it teleported right on me at one is the spots you can drop down to, and I was dead.
I don’t have the Salvo grenade launcher yet and I don’t have Anarchy.  I’ve got to look for a new clan that’s friendly and wants to do raids and show people.  I’m at 1309 power which includes the 10 boost.  I don’t have a Code Duello with the lasting impression and I keep trying to get one.  

I’ve tried with Witherhoard and that seems good for the mission but not great for the boss. I’ve done the pipe thing just tossing the witherhoard nades down.  I’ve tried the Jotunn and it’s good. The best boss damage seems to be Xenophage for the weapons I have.  I don’t have most of the Raid weapons, no Izinagis either. 

I’ve been using top tree NS with some charged with light mods like protective light.  The Code Duello launcher I have is ok, but it’s not great at accuracy and I’ve tested it outside the mission.  

I’ve read some people use truth but then you don’t get the damage burn.  I’ve been using the 6th Coyote for the extra dodge.  I’ve tried stasis and it’s good for the ads and freezing the boss, but that invis has saved me a bunch of times.  

Any advise would be great. I’ve watched a few vids. I’ve got to get Anarchy and I know I can buy it from the vault, I need to do some raids..."

This is fine, I am not worried about that, I was just curious, as I started brand new with Beyond Light, and I am currently 1265 Light/Power Level and was wondering what the best thing to do as a long term goal.  I am assuming I just keep doing the Powerful gear drops each week until I get up to 1300 and then start doing the pinnacles, and I would like to Raid eventually but if I cant raid until 1300 that's probably gonna a while, so I just wanted your opinion on what's the best thing to do for my level.  I feel so confused when I look at all the mod components and armor upgrades and everything, so a little guidance would be neat.

1,"The Blue 120 Hand Cannon called ""Azimuth DSU"" actually feels pretty solid and has Kill Clip for the 2 taps.","Took this out of collections to take into PvP for the lolz and it actually felt very good, especially the 2 taps lol. Give it a go if you can handle 120s. The reload is absurdly bad so if you can find ways around it via dodge, transversive steps/ophidian aspect and for the titan class, Aeon Swift with Sect of Force works for reload  if you combine it with a loader mod.

1,"Gambit desperately needs some work in its current state, and a tutorial mission","I have some suggestions, TL;DR below

#Gambit could really use a tutorial mission/quest

I've seen blueberries banking 3 and 4 motes. Although it doesn't happen often it hurts to see

- the tutorial mission could award a gambit legendary weapon or armor (so even vets have a reason to do it). It should put a player on the EDZ (most simple) map, or have a completely new arena that the drifter is using/ testing out for gambit. It should explain the following.

- use and explain blockers, what they do and what each tier does

- explains how and when you can invade

- explains what happens when you get invaded

- Explains killing envoys

- explains generalities such as the gray on the bars, HVTs, weapon choices (for killing ads, invading and killing blockers) heavy ammo etc.

#How gambit can change:

Saw another person post/ about heavy ammo and I loved the idea (sorry I don't know your username)

- make heavy ammo is less dependent on enemies and ONLY spawn (as a crate that all can take) at 50 and 100 motes banked. 

    1. this will be great because I have some matches where I never get heavy yet I get invaded by guys with seemingly full ammo

    2.  makes the first invasion MUCH less dependent on heavy ammo. Typically the first invasions swings the a match very heavily on one side 

#add a gambit freelance mode. 

I think this will be a great idea because my friends dislike gambit. I enjoy playing it, cranking out bounties, and making ol' Drifter proud. It isn't very fun getting back to back 4 stacks

#Primevals need something. 

We have gotten stronger since forsaken but the primevals have not and can, at times, be melted in literal seconds. I am not sure what exactly they need; however, I have some ideas.

- immunity phase like in Gambit prime 

- larger health pool (downside of this is blueberries or people trying to get bounties done may not have ""optimal"" DPS weapons.

Please if you have any other feasible ideas put them in the comments.

Also, if you agree that gambit could use some changes make posts about it, or upvote this one so that Bungie is more aware that this ought to be bumped a little higher on the priority list  :)


TLDR:

Add a tutorial mission/ quest with a gambit legendary as a reward. 

Make heavy ammo less dependent on RNG and have ammo crates spawn and 50 and 100 mote.

Add gambit freelance (please, please)

Primeval need either: immunity phases or a larger health pool."
1,A head canon story,"I'd recommend reading this in the character's voices in your heads. Asteriks so mods don't auto-remove based on words contained.

*Banshee's working on his gun at the Gunsmith's workstation like he always is when Saint-14 angrily walks up to him*

Saint: You sell Hakke, no?

Banshee: ... yes?

Saint: Explain! \[slams Tr\*als report down on Banshee's workbench\]

\[Banshee reads.\]

Saint: Osiris and I had to cancel our beloved tradition again this week over this.

Banshee (done reading): ...I don't think I have anything to do with this.

Saint: You gave them their identification, yes?

Banshee: I can't really remember.

Saint: This... is not good enough. Remember harder!

Banshee: I don't... wait. I used to give those things out left and right to my clients, nobody ever used them up until now.

Saint: Aha! You will pay for this, forgetful one.

Banshee: What could you possibly want that I have?

Saint: I do not know. But I will think.

\[Saint leaves. Later that day, he returns with Osiris.\]

Banshee: Hey, you two.

Saint: I have figured out what you are to do!

Banshee: ...huh? Oh, about the Tr\*als problem you're blaming me for?

Saint: Yes!

Osiris: Saladin's been going off the rails lately. Been a nightmare to work comms with on the Battlegrounds. Said something very unpleasant about Sagira today. So I would like for you to sell one of your Rasputin mods today.

Banshee: Rasputin mods... hmmmm... \[thinks for a second\]. Oh, right. You mean W\*rmind Cells. But why?

Osiris: The W\*rmind Rasputin took everything from him a long time ago, and it would pain him to see a sudden uptake in Guardians using the W\*rmind's abilities in combat. While I'm not normally the type for petty revenge, suffice it to say that he dealt a low blow.

Saint: Make him feel the way he made Osiris feel, yes?

Banshee: Alright. I actually forgot I had those mods stocked, thanks for reminding me. But I don't want Saladin coming after me next time he's in the Tower.

Saint: That's alright. He will not. Besides, even if he does, you will not remember why he is there.

Banshee: That's fair."

0,Bunker E15 Warmind cheese?,"So i was running Legendary lost sector bunker E15  and got to the second mob, 4 goblins, and accidentally spawned a warmind cell near the window (where you can see the other two cages). I blew it up and to my disbelief both the cages poped open and they started clearing the room! I cleard mob three and entered the room with nearly all first wave mobs dead and the turret spawning in. It was so crazy! 

I tried it a few more times and it always worked, but if you stay out of the room to long the 4 soldiers will start walking to the boss room while the second wave is spawning leaving you with only 4 soldiers instead of 8. But if you dont lag around i think this is a great cheese!"
0,I think the New Strike will be the longest yet.,"So we know several requirements from the strike, such as the ""Deposit Charges in the Land Tank"" The Strike has a triumph with a 15 minute ""time trial"" as well as all of these bosses  Optus Taxaat Optus Vocca Val Cempas Val Vinca'ar Val Kladior Val Cunqu'us Val Veorthus Val Trekitus Valus Ozysas Ignovun. 

This is a massive strike just with space alone, and this is leading me to believe strikes are going to become mini-dungeons. With mechanics sure, but mostly with time. If this is all we know, and the strike isn't out, I wonder how big this will be. Any theories?"
0,New Frostbite glitch + jump section on Hunter w/o stasis or sword ammo,"\*Language Warning\*

[https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/524856635](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/524856635)

Drive sparrow into forstbite area + jump off and step back out of frostbite, jump back on when frostbite = 0

Takes a little practice to get the jumps, warlocks and titans should have no troubles.

Use the slopes of the rocks to throw yourself upwards with momentum.

100 Mobility with Stomp335

No sword ammo and no  stasis grenades, which would obviously make that high jump MUCH easier, so this is probably the hardest way to do this section. Defs use these to get you through, only 2 hard-ish jumps and youre free to get through the whole section.

Sorry if someone else has posted something similar."

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS ME ASKING FOR YOUR THOUGHTS NOT ME SAYING IT'S 100% WHAT I THINK IT IS

&amp;#x200B;

 just wanted to scream that first okie

&amp;#x200B;

Alright bois so I'm the dude a while back who made the super long post about my studying the Pyramid Ships and what I believe the truth about them was. As a result of the time spent observing the Pyramid architecture in particular I am really confident in saying that I know it inside out. 

&amp;#x200B;

When BL came out I was extremely disappointed with the lack of Pyramid involvement in the campaign, the fact that the actual Pyramid interior was a copy and paste of the end of the Moon Pyramid, and the fact that the majority of the Pyramid architecture was relegated to ""simulations."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, the new architecture did have new engravings in the Exo Challenge missions, and the cruxes SPECIFICALLY have completely new whisper voice lines/creepiness (I recorded them for myself but I can upload them if you are interested.)

&amp;#x200B;

Long. Story. Short.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing the week 2 Exo Challenge, and I noticed at the end there was a style of engraving that didn't match the typical style of the place at all. I saw a rectangle going down, with a smaller one connected above. This exact engraving can be found on pillars in at least the second and third Exo Challenge, with the second challenge having that engraving as the outline for the entrance to the main complex (the part where you run in the tunnel with the disappearing floor, the pads form that symbol.) 

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing a third line separating the larger rectangle into two parts, in my mind this engraving represented one thing. A double edged blade with a thin rectangular hilt. I have to make this clear, this is going to be purely up to how you see it. Friends wise 3 agree with me and 2 are undecided, so I'm not just expecting everyone to see what I see.

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought it was a sword, and immediately a connection was made between this ""sword"" and the Sword Logic. This made sense to me, as although I do not believe the Pyramids to be the actual Darkness, I do believe they are allied with it, and so follow some form of the Sword Logic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at this thing which I think is a sword, and I'm just thinking. What struck me at the time was the ""handle"" and the ""blade."" The handle/hilt is thin and rectangular. The blade is double edged, but one side is wider than the other, the hilt not being in the direct centre of the blade as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately I thought of the Winnower’s blade, because I remember it being somewhat blocky as well. I pull up a picture and the similarities are extremely striking. Two double edged blades with one edge wider than the other, a third ""edge"" coming in from the side. I drew some lines in the slide to show you what I mean. At this stage, it’s really up to you as to whether or not you see the resemblance. I will argue with anyone that this is a sword, but if you think that it isn’t any sword in particular well, that’s all good.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the first part of this, which was just showing you what I found. The next is what this could mean if I'm right.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright for this part, assume that this engraving is in fact, a sword, and more that, the Winnower’s sword. What would this mean? I’ll tell you what it would mean for the Pyramids, the Winnower, and the deeper lore.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Pyramids this changes absolutely nothing about my beliefs surrounding them. In regards to the sword, it doesn’t really matter. Like I said, I don’t believe the Pyramids are the Darkness. I am adamant that the statue of the veiled lady is the Gardener, and the Pyramids who perhaps used to worship her,  are now allied with the Winnower, not actually him. It is very clear from what those inside the Pyramids have said that they do believe in some form of the Sword Logic, so seeing a sword is really not that surprising. If the sword is the sword I think it is, then this is a symbol of the logic that the Pyramids follow, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Winnower this would actually be extremely significant. If this is actually a representation of the sword shown in the concept art, then that concept art is what the Winnower to some extent looks like. Yes, I get it, he’s the Formless One, but if the Gardener has a physical form, then at some stage he must have had one as well. If you want proof about what the Gardener looks like I explain it all in my OG post and the video here: [https://youtu.be/xS4M-CIZBWQ](https://youtu.be/xS4M-CIZBWQ)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally for the lore, this is the really conspiracy theorist stuff. We're bringing out the Nastareth bois!  I would like to state that I am very aware that there are some people who groaned upon seeing that word, and to those of you I am sorry. But this is simply what I’ve found.

&amp;#x200B;

Sylok, THE DEFILED. Oh yeah, our buddy Silly Sylok. Sylok was a Taken Knight in the Prison of Elders and was experimented on by the Awoken. The Taken are pretty much braindead, and the only real stimulation that got some brain activity was pain, so they pretty much tortured him. He absolutely loved the pain, and one of the lines he said was “Blessed is the Nastareth.” ([https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/sylok-the-defiled?highlight=Nastareth](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/sylok-the-defiled?highlight=Nastareth)) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that is the only time in the lore that this word has been used, and no one has any idea what it means. If you google it you’ll find nothing, BUT, while I was searching the word Nastareth, I was met with the word Nastara.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there’s the name Nastara which means wild rose, don’t get mixed up with that. I believe it’s from Hindi, or one of the Indian languages, but a Nastara is a lancet. The plural of the word is nastaras/nashtaras btw so sounds very similar. Anyway a Nastara is a lancet, and a lancet, is a broad, double edged blade often used for surgery. What does any of this have to do with the Winnower you might ask? Ok this is where the waffle begins. The Winnower is the destroyer of life, but theoretically not all life. Only the life that he believes deserves it. As a result of this he is the pruner of the garden, the dude who separates the wheat from the chaff. He reaches in, cuts out a chunk of life, but is careful to only take what is needed. Sounds like the guy could use a lancet if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So why mention the Nastareth? Because honestly, at this stage what could it mean? It’s a word that’s dead in the water, most people not knowing it exists, and those who do know it having forgotten about its place in the big scheme of things. I’ve found a possible inspiration for the word, and that inspiration is a blade that fits with how the Winnower sees his work. So my friends, why not give the sword of the sword logic a name? Why not say the Winnower wields the Nastareth?

&amp;#x200B;

That is the conclusion to this discovery. I said it before and I’ll say it again, this isn’t me announcing that this is the 100% Winnower’s sword. Truth be told, even if I'm right, it's not too big a deal in my eyes, although it would tear down the notion that the veiled lady is the Winnower.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friends I will let you decide what this is. Is this as one of my friends put it, a hole in the wall? Do you think it’s a sword? Do you think it’s the Winnower’s sword. If you think it is, what do you think this means? Let me know.

It persists across runs and even platforms for me, so I assume it’s intentional. has this been happening to anyone else? and what (if anything) does it mean?"

0,Secret symbol near Future War Cult room or just texture?,"Hey guys. I was walking around in the tower being a little sleep derived and stopped next to the future war cult, because i remembered that there was a new lore piece with the FWC. I then stopped right at the entrance and turned around to see Saint-14. I then saw [this little symbol scatched](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ewofb3IW8AIC2z6?format=jpg&amp;name=large) into the door frame that i wasn't able to find elsewhere.

My thoughts:

- My first thought was that it resembled one of the Ada-1 forges, but the forges have the [""wings"" lower than i initially remembered](https://www.vgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/destiny-2-izanami-forge-guide-2.jpg)

- After thinking a little bit i thought about Savathûn and how her ""viral song"" is going around and that through those the cabal started carving runes and summoned Xivu Arath (correct me if i'm wrong please). The carving is similar to [that one rune on the crown of sorrows.](https://i.imgur.com/hAAnCPU.jpeg) We also know that the viral tune is now affecting more and more people around the tower.

- Maybe its just a texture glitch. Points against it being a coincidence: Bungie wants to hide clues as well as they can because data mining is in full effect after each update. Best way to hide it is to put it in textures that can be mirrored and still make sense (see Five Nights At Freddies). If it was a coincidence, why is it so obviously in eye sight (tho you can argument that things like these typically aren't seen because they are not right at player level).


So what do you guys think? Just a random texture glitch or something Bungie put in on purpose? 

Also sorry if this was found already. I googled ""symbols around future war cult"" and saw no posts on this."

0,The Sparrow Wall Climb Method,"Hey guys,

I don't usually post my videos here anymore, but I thought this one might be particularly helpful.

I've found a way to use a Sparrow to climb most walls, and the best part is it can be done on any class...even Hunters.

---

What you'll need:

1.  Exotic Sparrow (roll capabilities)
2.  Any Class
3.  A wall. (preferably straight, but it can work on slanty ones too.)

---

How to do it:

1.  Stand next to a wall.
2.  Jump, spawn sparrow.
3.  Roll towards the wall until you're upside-down.
4.  Boost twice in the opposite direction from the wall.

This will cause your Sparrow to clip into the wall and hold it upside down for a short time.  Because of this, your Guardian will fall off the Sparrow and land back up on top of it.

This means that you will get your jumps back so you can repeat the process.

0,Possible puzzle and findings about stars,"Hello.  
First I wanna make clear something: I don't intend to copy, be rude or disturb anybody. I am here to show my findings about a post from weeks ago. I am just a overthinker and might get things to far. If you don't intend to listen to what I have to say. Please, don't hate me for thinking something wrong. Thank you!

Ok, let's get started. So, some days ago, I found something about the limits in the prophecy dungeon's last part (the nine). It tends to go more towards the neon circle. (maybe you already known that)

Visual representation (sort of):[https://imgur.com/a/BmEwQki](https://imgur.com/a/BmEwQki)

If you look in the circle from behind it you can see the ""stars"" of the nine near her. Maybe it is meant to be like that, I mean, maybe we have to see something. I think we have to connect the dots/stars to form a constellation out of it which brings me up to the 2nd found.

The nine ""stars"": [https://imgur.com/a/O9o6AiL](https://imgur.com/a/O9o6AiL)

There are more constellations found in the Last Wish raid. Maybe you already seen my post about the stars we found in the Shuro Chi.

Post (if you didn't):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/lnr8j0/constellation\_found\_in\_shuro\_chis\_encounter\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/lnr8j0/constellation_found_in_shuro_chis_encounter_under/)

Kali also has 1 gazebo like that one:  [https://imgur.com/a/tcXRJEH](https://imgur.com/a/tcXRJEH)

The idea is. Bungie has some stars/constellation related ornaments/shells/projections/stuff. Maybe they added it just to remind us about those things.

Also, it seems a bit suspect.. why they added a different pattern for every single gazebo in the LW if there was nothing? Couldn't they copy past it.. also.. why are the stars so bright?

Another ""strange"" set of stars was found in the new cutscene that was leaked before. I also made a post about that, but I think there is nothing at all. Maybe just a reminder.

Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/m20neg/cool\_easter\_egg\_or\_a\_puzzle\_season\_of\_the\_chosen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/m20neg/cool_easter_egg_or_a_puzzle_season_of_the_chosen/)

Maybe we can get the ""constellations"" aligned to the Last Wish symbols. Maybe we can found a code out of it. Maybe there is nothing at all.

What do you think about that? Also, if there is someone that knows how to align the stars. You can add me on discord to solve this together: NonManifest#4389

0,Last Wish Wish Wall Bug,"For some reason the wish wall is bugging out when using pulse rifles.

Just take the closer wrong warp, and sword fly to the left of the bubble. Then it's just like it was in the [Quantum Finisher days](https://youtu.be/WVPNaw5AlYI).

Since there's no sparrow needed, you can do this from the raid. See [here](https://youtu.be/2DHRrss9r9U?t=224) for how to get there.

This means for a few more days, it may be possible to do [with 11 people](https://youtu.be/mti73xFUnH0). One must be sacrificed to allow for the [wrong warp](https://youtu.be/pum2El-fO8o) to work.

The 2nd reachable via the opposite side. There is a metal frame thing going from the side of the ship to the roof.

Once up there, you will eventually be able to scan the scannable after a few attempts as you keep res’ing up there.

There is 2 more clusters of these scannables but they are definitely beyond reach.

And it's not just the lament being anti barrier, I tried it on a non-frozen wyvern, doesn't work. Maybe other weapons work too, it's just the lament deals a lot of dmg in one hit so in the chaos of the battle it was clearly visible, the wyvern's health decreasing.

0,"Is there a secret boss encounter on ""The Glassway"" strike?","I originally posted this on r/Destinythegame and was advised to ask here.

*My original post*
&gt;Had something weird happen to me the other night, never had it occur before so wanted to share it here.

Normally, the boss encounter is split between killing the big boy with orange shields and the transcendent hydra that hides toward the player on the right or left of the map. You kill those two, boom, you're done.


I managed to kill the big boy in one phase (curaiss thundercrash + volotile induction) but had to do all 3 phases to kill the transcendent. 1st phase damage on transcendent is as normal he teleports away after taking damage and ads spawn in. Cleared ads and the transcendent rememerges, but this time with another orange shielded hydra, a model I've never seen, shorter and stumpier than the original big boy hydra, but still larger than the transcendent. On the third phase, we killed the stumpy orange hydra and no shit, 9/10 wyverns spawned simultaneously. I died here, up close with my lament on the transcendent, didn't anticipate getting cluster fucked by so many wyverns. Whilst down my team failed to killed them quick enough, they despawned and the strike ended as it would normally.


Has this happened to anyone else?



Ive had a few people suggest one of my party may have had the Lament quest active. I've gotten the Lament myself and can't remember that happening, only the yellow bar harpy spawning."

0,Presage dead guardian absorbs Stasis?,"So yesterday I was doing a run of the Presage mission with a few friends, and when we got to the end I decided to toss an Icewall grenade at the hanging body. No real reason, just thought it was funny. Much to my surprise, it actually did something I hadn't seen before. The tendrils wrapped around the body and emerging from it actually began to glow around where the stasis crystals had been. Not the usual symbol stasis leaves, but whole segments were glowing blue, and stayed like that for about a minute. (Pic here for reference [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2421498080](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2421498080) ) I experimented a bit with the other growths in the room, but none of them produced this effect that I could find, only the ones attached to the body.

0,Schemes triumph after presage mission,"Okay so I did a Presage run last week and after the mission ended I got the “Schemes” triumph.

I checked light.gg and it said that there were no objectives, or it was “incomplete”

I’m still unsure if this is important or not, but it’s interesting cause I don’t know how I got it"
0,"Savathûn's Song - I think Eris is either lying to us or misinformed, and we've been hearing it for a lot longer than a year","The Whisper is one of my favorite bits of Destiny content ever. I probably did that mission 50 times, taking friends through the various versions. I solo'd it a bunch of weeks for chest progress and catalysts. I listened to the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7o6Y3Tw5Zg) at work like a weirdo. This mission debuted with Warmind, and is generally though of as us proving ourselves to (or conquering) Xol in order to earn him as a weapon, in the Whisper of the Worm.

Last season, most of the focus was on Deep Stone Crypt, Beyond Light brought us new musical themes, and the seasonal stuff like wrathborn hunts fell a bit by the wayside. But something stuck out to me in the Hawkmoon/Harbinger mission. [Take a listen, and pay attention to 1m24s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRbPxd5dHxQ). We've heard that [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7o6Y3Tw5Zg&amp;t=668s). But I always thought of ""A Thousand Wings"" (Whisper music) to be ""Xol's theme"". Interestingly though, take a listen to the actual [boss fight music against Xol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhUh-mnKEMw). Okay, it's a banger, but this motif *is nowhere to be found*.

This also shows up in Shadowkeep, namely in Garden of Salvation vs. the [Consecrated Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp4PkKiqlqk) (both phases). It plays loud and clear, plain as day at 1m50s. What we have been *told* is Savathûn's Song also plays here - it even opens the first phase, and it also plays in the Consecrated Mind boss fight music. This particular theme doesn't appear there, and I think that will be important, but I don't yet know how. Savathûn and ""the darkness"" are certainly intertwined, but are *not the same thing*, and I think we could argue that the Beyond Light theme may actually be our first proper theme for ""the darkness"".

Now this season it is *FUCKING EVERYWHERE*. Hangar action music in the [Presage mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcdYhKmecVM) (first debut at 1m9s - however, note it doesn't appear in the boss fight music against the Locus of Communion), and it plays in the music when you are in The Pit lost sector in the EDZ as part of the Contender's Ascent IV quest (from week 4 of the current season). This motif has more appearances now than even the Traveler's theme (I think most recently shows up in Heretical Omen from Pit of Heresy) or the guardians' theme (shows up briefly in the boss fight vs. Taniks in DSC).

Today I stumbled across the music from the intro mission to the [Forsaken campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCkZy4Dwr0). Skip ahead to Action 2 and take a listen. We now know the events of Forsaken to have been orchestrated by Savathûn, enacted via Riven. It's worth nothing that, to my knowledge, this motif does not show up anywhere in the Last Wish raid. But you know what? We have actually run in to it before. Guess where.

#[Savathûn's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMlLKnbACII)

This kinda feels like Bungie has been screaming at us for the last year to try to get us to pay attention to this; it's starting to become ridiculous as we draw closer to The Witch Queen, and I would expect it to keep cropping up.

I don't think we've been hearing ""Savathûn's Song"" since Shadowkeep. I think we've been hearing it since the Red War and Eris either doesn't know or is misdirecting us re:Shadowkeep theme.

This has some disturbing implications. It kind of re-contextualizes the Whisper of the Worm mission. It's less us ""earning"" the power to wield Xol, and more him being fed to us by Savathûn. I think it may also tie everything together about why we are able to visit the Glykon, considering the Crown of Sorrow is onboard, a direct link to Savathûn, and represents her control... and I'm sure there are other implications I have missed."

0,Lore book Marasenna corresponds with various seasons and DLC's from the past/future.,"Bit of Spinfoil speculation: The lore book Marasenna almost perfectly corresponds to a season that was released either currently or previously, at least as far as I can see. I saw the lore entry Katabasis (21) and my mind went right to Presage and the guardian Katabasis we find dead at the end. If that lore entry corresponds to season of the Chosen, then we can work backwards to find what other entries relate to each season:

Katabasis the guardian/""moving downhill""==Chosen, it uses his name unclear about the definition

Imponent I-V ""One who imposes a rule""==Hunt, not clear perhaps the relationship between Crow and Spider?

Heresiology ""The study of heresy""==Beyond Light (which is why there is only 1 entry), we begin wielding the darkness and studying it, IE heresy against the light.

Fideicide I-III ""One who breaks trust""==Arrivals, the darkness arrives and attempts to shatter our faith in the light.

Ecstasiate I-III ""to enter a state of ecstasy""==Worthy, not clear

Cosmogyre I-IV ""the universe is spinning""==Dawn, not clear

Brephos I-III ""a newborn child""==Undying, not clear

Archiloquy ""The start of a speech""==Shadowkeep, the first DLC after Forsaken perhaps?

&amp;#x200B;

Then going the other way from katabasis we have:

Nigh I-II ""soon, nearby""==next season

Palingenesis I-III ""to be reborn, bring back tradition""==season after next

Revanche ""moving to reclaim lost territory""==Witch Queen

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have exact relations for each word to the season it corresponds to, but I'm not a linguist or very bright. We can clearly see there are 'onedrop' lore entries for when a DLC drops and a set of lore for a given season. I might be giving bungie a bit too much credit to think that far ahead, but the coincidence is certainly there at least."
0,Is Caiatl taking over the official Destiny twitter the start of an ARG?,"Just wondering if anyone has thought about this yet? 

I am wondering if there is some way we could possibly ask the right questions to get clues towards something bigger. I have noticed that she will reply to specific people and specific questions. There was good example today where she tweeted about getting Eris to turn Savathun into a weapon... 

[https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1369709785600430092?s=20](https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1369709785600430092?s=20)

0,"Cool Easter Egg or a puzzle? Season of the Chosen ""new"" cutscene","Hi! Today I started destiny 2 as normal and the cutscene that was leaked about Zavala has started. You already know the story of the cutscene and others. But has anyone felt a pressure on the part with the stars? I mean, it took longer for the stars to disappear than the cutscene itself ( jk ). Something makes me feel like it's an cool easter egg or a puzzle.  
I made a post this year about Shuro Chi's stars found under the gazeboo. They had something special.  
In this cutscene we can see the close/same type of stars: Big and bright, small and less brighter then others and etc.  


Cutscene: [https://imgur.com/a/yE7i0jt](https://imgur.com/a/yE7i0jt)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I am saying that is an easter egg or a puzzle?**  
Early this season, Bungie released the Projections bundle. Witch had the exact same theme: **stars and symbols among the stars.**

Maybe that was a ""preview"" or a ""teaser"" for this cutscene, maybe the stars seen in the cutscene are the stars in the bundle. I didn't spend so much time to line the stars.  


**a puzzle?**

It maybe corelates to the post I made and stars from Shuro Chi in a way. I looked at one group of stars and it didn't look like any projection from the bundle, so they might have a different meaning. How ever, same we thought about DSC constellation on the reddit post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep\_stone\_crypt\_cutscene\_constellation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep_stone_crypt_cutscene_constellation/)  


I will not spend time trying to solve or complete this puzzle/easter egg. Why? Because I know no one cares about that. Just a theory of my overthinking."
0,Another Ghost has died?,"So I was looking at my lore tabs and noticed I was missing a ""Ghost Stories"" 22/23. However, I was 100% I got them all, a quick google search shows that, [yes there are only 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMBWiP2p4MA&amp;ab_channel=Esoterickk); and the Ghost in the Presage mission doesn't count towards that. 

So...who died? Or is this just a bug? I have a screenshot before Beyond Light with all the Lore done so I didn't miss one."
0,Season of The Dark Future?,"I know this theory is kinda far out, but the armor sets that they teased for Witch Queen got me thinking. What if in the Witch Queen or the seasons after we actually visit the Dark Future from Elizabeth's original timeline? As a way to see Savathuns strategies and how she brought the city to its knees. And then use that knowledge to better plan counters. I mentioned the armor because the Symbology and visual language of the new concept art reminds me of Braytech and Elsie's symbol.

( https:// imgur.com/a/aH5E5Zb )

This may be a bit of a reach, but I think its possible we could see something involving Elsie's timeline more heavily down the road. I think we could see a darker version of braytech armor that was salvaged from the ruins of The Bombardment. Or something a little less spinfoily maybe we will see Ada-1 and Elsie collaborating to make Stasis weapons and armor. Would love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to absolutely destroy my theory I'd love to have a conversation."

There a pipes at each boiler room entrance you can sit on and wait for the locus to come to you, sit on these pipes and jump in and out of the entrance to get his attention, then use felwinters and xenophage for damage with a stasis super for ads.

At the end i add a side note, that with the emote it can ""See"" through doors that are made to open or that are very thin.

This is a side note that you can take with a grain of salt, when ""Presage"" came out on the first day and i got to the end room and used the emote on the lower doors of the room and found that it had more visibility that i could ""see"", so i concluded that they were doors that would open later.

as we destroyed the nukes theres no defences for the crypt any more in DSC deepdive they said ""we are now the defenders of the crypt""

Adam miller I'm on to your secrets look at his [twitter](https://twitter.com/desmondia?lang=en) the phrase ""words manafacturer"" means he holds an importance to his choice of words.

[player 1] will now get ready to launch the activity, and [player 3] will get ready to join on [player 2], bringing the whole group of 10. [Player 1] will now launch and call for [player 3] to join up a little before the launch timer reaches 2 seconds.

If done right, [player 1] should see “someone is joining your fireteam” around 0 seconds.

If not, [player 1] and [player 2] change characters or leave the fireteam and try again.

Hope this helps, good luck out there farming golf balls and shadow price!"

0,The Nova Armor sets are 99.99% related to the DSC,"So let's start with a few other theories and then we'll get right to the proof:



So first off, the armor sets have the three most important alchemical elements written on them. If we look at how Clovis Bray treated his work in the DSC we can clearly observe that he was comparing his work to alchemy. Hell, he didn't even invent the term ""Alkahest"" it's just a mythical substance from, you've guessed it, Alchemy.




Then, if we look at the designs of these sets, it clearly looks like they are some kind of research or hazmat suits. The Titan one has some kind of vials near the shoulders and we can see some kind of rubber boots (On Hunter) and rubber undersuit (on every set)





And now, for  the actual proof, it consists of one single gun: Trustee. You can see that Trustee has some very similar symbols. Actually, most of the DSC weapons have these symbols, except the Succesion and Heritage.

0,The Witch Queen Armour Symbols.,"It's already going around that the armour is themed around alchemy, elements and minerals ect...


with the hunter being mercury for mind, the titan being salt for body and the warlock being sulphur for the soul. (this fact was brought to my attention because of u/Hip_Hop_Kido)

&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to see if we could identify the meaning behind all the symbols... There's a lot of interesting references on the armour.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: The Star that appears on all three armour could be a reference to the seven pointed heptagram. ""In alchemy, a seven-sided star can refer to the seven planets which were known to early alchemists, and also, the seven alchemical substances: fire, water, air, earth, sulphur, salt and mercury.""


&amp;nbsp;


Hunter: 

&amp;nbsp;

Collar has triangles which mean Water ""🜄"" and Air ""🜁"", Mother and Son or Swords and Cups.


To the left and Right of the Collar is the atomic number (left) and atomic weight (right) for mercury.



On the boot is the Symbol for Mercury in alchemy ""☿"".


then what could be the seasonal symbol, a whirlpool? a flower? fish eating bait?

Then the symbol for Calcium Oxide which alchemists called ""Quick Lime"" ""🝁""


&amp;nbsp;



Titan:


&amp;nbsp;

On their chest is the symbol of salt ""🜔"" combined with another symbol.  A circle with two dots. The two dotted circle appears three times unmerged with salt, once on the gauntlet, once on the mark and once on the boot.


(Edit: This Circle with two dots is the symbol for sea salt, thanks for u/KittenAlfredo for pointing that out).


The shoulders have Na and Cl, the atomic symbols for Sodium and Chlorine which become Sodium Chloride aka salt.



The very top of the titan mark has 17 on the top left and 35.453 on the right which is the atomic number and atomic weight of Chlorine.


Lower down the mark are some symbols i cound't figure out followed by the symbol for bizmuth ""🜘"" and the symbol for crucible ""🝨"" merged together.


&amp;nbsp;


Warlock:


&amp;nbsp;


The faceplate shape is that of the symbol for air ""🜁"".


The chest has the strange symbol that appears on all three armours. It's surrounded by the symbol for philosophers sulphur ""🜎"", the atomic symbol for sulphur ""S"", The alchemic symbol for vinegar ""🜊"" and upside-down and incomplete version of the symbol for black sulphur ""🜏"" which may mean something else.



On the hips is the atomic number and atomic weight of sulphur. 16 and 32.066.



At the very bottom of the fabric is a completed and actual version for black sulphur ""🜏"". above it appear to be incomplete versions of the alchemic symbol for Phosphorus."

0,Adding in new Butterflies to the game? Minigame etc,"Currently we have 4 different Butterflies in the game as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/m2LVUxA.png).  And when used on other players it actually gives them some cool buffs. 

I'd like to propose the idea of adding in more Butterflies to the game on the same scale as Implings — and perhaps even bringing out a Puro-Puro game for them as well. 

You could add Butterflies up to 85-90 Hunter that give run energy and special attack onto other places.  A Butterfly that grants Special Attack to others would be worth a lot of money.  If you are a tank or a support role and your main DPS missed his DWH spec, you could use this Butterfly on him and he can try again (all you have to do is use it on them, no trade screen).  It has uses for sure and would be at a cost — or be rare if you're an ironman (think d imp).

However, this is only one example at the higher end.  There's so much more you can do with Butterfly perks.  You could easily add in 8-10 more different variants. 

I know in RS3 you can barehand catch Butterflies for a bit of Agility XP too, however, we could simply make the rates much smaller in OSRS. 

Just wanted to propose a small idea that I think could add more incentive to the Hunter skill. Butterfly perks as a whole are quite interesting and would play a great role in this economy and bossing meta.

Would love to hear your thoughts!"

This way, if the team fails to join, only two players will have to swap characters, and they can rejoin each other faster. If the team joins before the mission launches, simply have the two back out after promoting the joining fire team leader to host. Additionally, refreshing the lobby after a few tries and reinviting the joining fire team seems to help. Hope this helps, happy 12 Manning!"

0,"If you have a full engram inventory, instead of the exotic armor piece from doing a solo legend/master LS, you get an exotic engram, which might decrypt into the armor piece from the other LS.","I was doing the legend LS, which is Bunker at 1300 PL today. I didn’t have any of the new exotic chests, so I was hoping to pick it up on all of my characters.

When I got to my Hunter, he had like 8 or 9 umbral engrams (they still kinda do drop frequently), and in the course of doing the LS, I eventually ended up having 10 in my inventory - full.

At the end of my third run (I had gotten the chest on my third run on my other two characters, so I was expecting it at the end of the third on my Hunter), I got an exotic engram. I figured that since I had a full engram inventory, it didn’t decrypt immediately and I knew it was gonna be in my postmaster.

So I go to the HELM to decrypt some umbrals to make space, and as expected, the exotic engram was in my postmaster.

I was afraid that maybe, because I wasn’t inside the LS, I was gonna end up with a random exotic I already owned.

But when I picked it up from the postmaster, it decrypted into the exotic arms that are available in the 1330 master LS. I hadn’t yet gotten them in my collection, so there was no way it would decrypt from a regular exotic engram, as far as I know.

I figure that the game knows that it’s an exotic engram from a LS, but it doesn’t distinguish from legend or master. So when you decrypt it, you have a chance of it decrypting into the exotic from the other LS.

I did go back to the Bunker to try and get the chest, and I got it on my second run. It decrypted immediately cause my engram inventory was no longer full."

0,12 Man Raids (or other activities),"Big thanks to Scrub for finding this.

Split into 2 teams with the leaders as physically close to each other as possible (for lower ping), one with 5 people and one with 7 people.

Have the 5 person team launch into the raid. Have them call out when the countdown hits 2 (you may need to change that number based on how fast the connection is). The leader of the 7 person team needs to join the 5 person team, wait on the screen that says ""bring fireteam with you"", and when the leader of the 5 person team calls out you click ""bring with me"". If done correctly you will get into the raid with 12 people, but it is really tight timing.

If you end up with a 12 person fireteam in orbit, you need to join a little later. If you end up with 5 people in the raid you need to join a little earlier.

Good luck, it is really fun!

Note: Make sure the launching fireteam has 1 slot open for every joining fireteam, staying within the original player limit. For example, for nightfalls, have 2 people in the fireteam. Have another fireteam with 10 people. I have only tested it with raids, but I think it works in other places as well.

0,I think the witch queen armor stand for the three darkness subclasses!,"Everyone probably has seen the newly revealed ""The Witch Queen"" expansion armor.

Well i did some research, and i found some things worth noting.

First of all the middle guardian armor references Sodium Chloride or salt,

The right represents Sulfur and we can also see that it has the atomic number of sulfur.

The left one has number 80 the atomic number of mercury.

What many of you probably don't know is that alchemist start their journey at their body(Salt) to purified it to true salt with the other elements. They are btw called elements.

Now the salt element is explained as follows:

salt stands for condensation, crystallization, and the underlying essence of a body.

Kinda sounds like stasis to me, us starting out on this darkness adventure unlocking the darkness within ,becoming literally frozen and then breaking the ice to unlock our darkness powers. In alchemy they also believe you have to break down your body to get to the core because your body or salt as they believe is made out of mercury and sulfur. If this is indeed right this could mean the others are upcoming darkness subclasses

The other 2 are explained as follows:

\-(mercury) mercury was thought to transcend life/death and heaven/earth.

\-(sulfur) Sulfur was used to denote the expansive force, evaporation, and dissolution

I think the mercury one will be the next subclass because mercury is all about the mind like Savathun she sought to transcend life and death with Nokris and in the presage mission we hear the voices of the dead. The prophecy dungeon has a place called heaven and hell which reminds me of the heaven and earth.

And also what does a witch do she makes poison,many us expect a poisonous subclass in the witch queen expansion. What is mercury? Very poisonous.

And then in lightfall we will probably unlock the sulfur subclass, the core darkness one , what does the darkness do? it expands, evaporates and dissolves the light.

Also about salt being stasis, look at how beyond light focused on exo's ,literal bodies made out and vex milk and they later added darkness(clarity) but still the exo bodies do have certain malfunctions and degrade over time. Of course if we follow the alchemical explanation that is very logical because the body (pure) salt is build out of mercury (mind) and sulfur(spirit) what is it that the exo's have problems with, their memory mind and their spirit/personalities that change. Which aren't like they should b hence the malfunction.

&amp;#x200B;

[ErrantStriker](https://www.reddit.com/user/ErrantStriker/) also pointed out that the seven pointed star and/or the seven armed galaxy   could be referring to the 7 planetary metals in alchemy and considering that 6 of the 7 planets mentioned are, or at least where, in game, wether directly or via their moons, leaving Venus as the only one that isn't in game (yet).

0,"Ozletc, The Sky Piercer Returns! Sundial Boss Discovered Hidden in Plain Sight","Wha wha wha whaaaaaa?..

Yeah, 1 of Season of Dawns Psion Flayer Sundial Bosses is hidden in plain sight in Season of the Chosen. 
Ozletc is one of the Psions behind a barrier on the 2nd Objective of Battleground Oracle. 
Looking into the room doesn’t show any names, even if scoped in. When the objective is complete, she runs near the barrier, disappears and then the barrier itself comes down. 
You can only see her name from inside the room before the objective is complete.


The description of Battleground Oracle reads, 
A group of former Red Legion Psions are communing with Vex prediction engines deep within Nessus. They seek to gain tactical insights by analysing simulations of future events against their own psychic foresight. Eliminate this threat before they can deliver their intelligence to Empress Caiatl.
Ozletc does get away..

If you’d like to check out my video about it, you can find it [here](https://youtu.be/Pk1bICZsFPM).

Now for a Text Tutorial.

With a bit of Sword Flying, Dawnblading, Salvation Gripping or Stasis Nade Platforming, you can get over the top of the barrier and drop inside the room. 
Its that simple. 
The 2 small Psions have no name but Ozletc does, and you can kill them all.
Ozletc has a big health pool like any boss. May be the same size health pool as in Season of Dawn.
Either way, they all stand there and don’t fight back but Ozletc may stomp you.

0,VoG will be on Venus,"\&gt; In Season 14, the Vault of Glass will return. The team will have a lot more to say about it before launch, but there are a few things I’d like to clarify now. Our philosophy behind bringing things out of the Destiny Content Vault is to keep them feeling like the content you remember while updating them to meet Destiny 2 difficulty and raid standards. So, while the high-level experience remains the same, you should expect the raid team to have a few tricks up their sleeves when **you tackle the depths of Venus** this summer.   


Certainly not the full destination, and could still launch from any planet (with a Vex gate), but this is some lovely confirmation that the VoG itself didn't move."

0,Possible braille on Witch Queen Nova armor,"With the release of bungie's dev blog about Witch Queen they added a picture of a new armor set named Nova. (I don't know if that's it's actual name or a code name.) If you look at the armors' chest pieces you can see a bunch of dots arranged in patterns that strongly remind me of braille, with the titan having the most and easiest to see. Thought it was worth mentioning since bungie likes hiding things.

0,Before you leave the glitched Fallen S.A.B.E.R. strike...,"As you know, the Fallen S.A.B.E.R. stike is glitched: once you complete the strike, your team wipes and you will repeat the mission all over. BUT, you will be stuck at the beginning, with the warsat no longer dropping (without the warsat, there's no way to continue the strike).

I think that everyone already acknoledged that the bugged part of the strike also counts as part of the strike. You will be stuck with your own instance of the cosmodrome, with randoms joining and leaving all the time. You can make use of this and complete bounties and/or other quests without teammates stealing your kills. You can use the Velles Labyritnh to farm enemies for catalysts.

Yesterday, I got stuck in this instance, and I realised that I could complete the Salvager's salvo quest. Just use Fighting lion!

TL;DR: The bugged instance of the Fallen saber can be used to complete strike objectives

0,“All The Scattered Pieces” Exotic Quest Triumph With Interesting Description,"So I’ve been making videos guides for all the clues/scannables inside the Presage mission currently 5 scannables and 6 clues both connected to 2 different triumphs but noticed another 4 more clues to come on this triumph and the description I thought was interesting.

Sounds like we are not only getting more story but more things are going to play out in the Glykon possibly. After all the name “Presage” essentially means a warning or omen for something bad about to happen.

Things we also noticed
- the out of map player can also load into maze from outside by heading to the egregore link and shoot it while he's guiding us through maze having buff for all of us but we had to keep an eye on where he goes so that buff remains on us

- Sometimes when we loose buff he return to that link to get it faster than if we look for it because he can see all maze paths from above"

I think that season 14 or 15 will be about cleansing of Dreaming City, while it is being invaded by Darkness (revealed in one of BL vidocs, there was a shot of Guardian running in Dreaming City, with Pyramid shard hovering behind them) and the unvaulted VoG will be location of Quria we will have to invade to get rid of her, using the Oracles inside LW probably during community event to find or build a portal into VoG."
0,Morgeth Forever Fight Raid Challenge Cheese,"Building on the recent posts by u/fellowgamer837 and u/NonManifest, and the video from u/pastuleo23 a while back about damaging immune enemies with Stasis, me and some of my clan decided to do a bit of testing to see how much damage you could do to Morgeth using Lament and Stasis without killing him. This would allow the encounter to be started for a very quick kill and provide an easy way of getting the Forever Fight challenge (doing the encounter without killing the ogres that spawn).

Video of us starting the encounter and getting the kill here: [https://youtu.be/_ABcDNjLLXg](https://youtu.be/_ABcDNjLLXg)

A revved Lament heavy attack on Morgeth when he's frozen does 24,858 damage. My initial estimate based on measuring Morgeth's health bar turned out to be a bit off and we killed him the first time. We tried to do one attack fewer than that run but our numbers turned out to be a bit off because we also killed him the second time. 

I estimate that Morgeth has somewhere around a little over 3,604,410, because when we finally did it we did 145 revved heavy Lament attacks, which was enough to leave him with only a tiny bit of health. You could possibly do 146 attacks, but 147 was too many

After 145 attacks we started the encounter, hit him with Stasis again and did a few more sword hits. We rotated in and out for ammo as necessary.

Hope this helps anyone else who is still slowly creeping towards Rivensbane."

0,"Possible ""Escape the Ship"" ending in Presage","Now, this is a shot in the dark and I've been holding on to this for the last week to see if anything new comes up, but seeing as nobody's mentioned this, here goes nothing.

To start, we should have our expectations straight. Presage is obviously a puzzle mission with much higher polish and attention to detail than previous missions like it, so brushing things off as coincidence or existing ""for no reason""/etc should be the last conclusion we come to. 

In this mission, we have two main types of physical doorways we use to navigate the mission: classic Cabal ship doors and maintenance hatches. The first point of curiosity came when my s/o and I did the mission for the first time- in the first puzzle room, there is a second Spore that allows you to go back through the spore door back to where you started, up on the platform above the second wave of Screebs. Curious, because you can entirely ignore this spore when going for solo flawless, and there's a maintenance hatch next to it that matches 3 maintenance hatches used to progress through the room.

When we did the mission the second time to get our random rolled Dead Man's, she noticed you could open the giant door at the beginning of the mission from the inside. Looking out, and seeing your ship out there? It looks just like the end of a story mission where we have to run to your ship, like we did in Taken King and Beyond Light. On top of that, the Spore door in the same room can be accessed from both sides. That makes 2 spore doors that can be accessed from both sides, so that can't not mean something...right?

The last piece of evidence I have towards this idea is the only other Maintenance hatch I've found so far that seems out of place; at the very end of the Hangar segment, by the ship you have to jump on. Considering there's a Crown of Sorrows room underneath the bridge of the ship, it may connect back somehow. 

We still have to get Katabasis's Ghost. We may end up having to just grab it and run.."

0,Savathun's Song not included in... Savathun's Song,"I recently ran through Garden of Salvation and I noticed Savathun's Song was everywhere during the boss encounters music. [During one of your confrontations with The Consecrated Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft3kZcoTjzg), [as well as the fight against The Sanctified Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCae_Cj9aTM), the full, complete 8 notes pop their ugly head in our legendary battles with the Vex (Both found at the beginning of each of their respective Phase 1s, as well as later in the songs themselves). After this horrifying revelation, I thought to myself: What about that one strike on Titan? The one where Taeko-3 dies? Wasn't that shrieker's name Savathun's Song? Is Savathun's Song in [Savathun's Song?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjDFqEp5bac) 

With my semi-trained ear I couldn't find it anywhere in the song. It's sad, sure, but I'm not super surprised that this motif isn't found in one of the vanilla strikes, as that would've taken a considerable larger amount of foresight and planning, and I'm assuming planning 2 years in advance still takes a lot of effort.

However, I'm not entirely convinced that there isn't ANY reference to Savathun's Song. I mean the strike's boss's name is ""Savathun's Song,"" that in of itself is a reference to the approaching Savathun. I also know there are ways to hint at a melody without playing the actual melody. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K-9Ekzc2A) video from a Youtuber I enjoy watching points out (specifically from 13:07 to 14:11, but I recommend watching the entire thing) that one can take a handful of notes (Let's say, D F G E C E F B for example, because those are the notes in Savathun's Song) and play them backwards, or in a different key, or any other combination of modifications. My issue is that I don't have the sheet music to any of these arrangements, because if I did I might be able to do it, but I don't think any of the songs we would need/want to analyze have published sheet music, and I know that by the time that I transpose it myself the Witch Queen AND Lightfall will already be released because most of my musical experience comes vicariously through that Youtuber I cited and I would probably give up before I ever do anything. Hence why I'm asking y'all for help. Where else can we find Savathun's Song? Other than the places that already have been mentioned (Namely all of the instances found in [Byf's video from last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP28-xqkH1w), and from the Garden of Salvation), is there any other places that this lil' dity?

I do want to add something before I post, a theory/very educated guess: Savathun's Song is in the Garden of Salvation because Salvation was trying to corrupt us. I think this is already well established, as we know Lisbon-13 turned and embraced his Shadow-clone, found [here](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/legacys-oath-plate?highlight=Lisbon-13), and I assume that Savathun was trying to do the same to us. But I digress"

0,"The mission 'Presage' is, quite literally, an omen.","I was [reading a post](/https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/lmnjj5/bungie_foreshadowing_the_darkness_in_d1_and_d2s) by /u/The-Warlock-Osiris from a couple days ago, and I didn't see mention of one particular detail -

The definition of the word 'presage' is ""to be a sign or warning that something (usually something bad) will happen"", or it can be used as a noun. In this case quite literally, the mission is a presage for... what, we're not quite sure, but it's very interesting that the mission's name marks it as an omen.

It may be presaging the arrival of The Darkness, or I believe a new, Darkness-adjacent hivemind species, as indicated by the buff we receive in the quest, Egregore Link, which seems to ""attune"" us so we can pass through what are seemingly similar to barriers of psychic energy. An egregore is more than just a non-physical entity, it's a collective projection of thought and energy, which may be the creatures the Darkness has bonded with as a physical extension of its power."

0,"How to do 1,500,000 Damage with Thundercrash [Video Included]","**TLDR**: [1,500,000 Damage Thundercrash - Destiny 2 Season of the Chosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-3DhYsGYN4) (Philly was just there to hold the boss in place, he did nothing else, aka ""The Fluffer"")

This method requires 1 non-thundercrash user but the debuffs will stack onto more thundercrash - Theoretically you could hit 7.5m damage with 5 titans + 1 stasis user.

We tested this number at Karl and the Lake of Shadows boss, but the footage is just from Karl.




**Loadouts Used**

*Titan(s)*

* Cuirass of The Falling star
* Volatile Conduction (Artifact Mod)
* Focusing Lens (Artifact Mod)
* Something to redbar yourself on command, we used Mountain Top. Ricochet rounds would be more practical

*Other (In this case, Stasis Hunter)*

* Stasis Subclass w/ Duskfield grenade
* Divinity
* Sundering Glare




**Why Does This Work?**

There were a lot of little nuances that went into getting this right, the damage comes from a very specific string of events. 

The duskfield grenade is meant to freeze the enemy with a delay (a 3rd person can be used to throw a coldsnap instead right as titan is about to hit if you can't get this timing down). Once the debuffer throws the duskfield they immediately start tapping divinity - We are tapping to reduce the chance of breaking the target out of stasis. The reason we use duskfield for the delay is so that the divinity cage can proc as well as sundering glare (Divinity can proc sundering glare off its own cage). The tricky part is getting the timing right for the Titan(s), you have to hit the target while they are frozen for maximum damage (780k vs 975k) and that window is really small.

The reason this works is thanks to the [3.1.0 Patch Notes](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50097) including the following:

&gt; When frozen by Stasis, AI combatants now take 5% more damage from Special-ammo weapons, Heavy-ammo weapons, and non-Stasis abilities. 

We aren't entirely sure how the math checks out when going from 780k -&gt; 975k impact but someone can probably figure that part out. We assume it is because the 5% buff to abilities is applied first in the calculation. The rest of the damage comes from Divinity (30%), Sundering Glare (20%), Focusing Lens (20%), Cuirass of The Falling star (100%), and Volatile Conduction (30%).

We calculated the 1,500,000 number including the tick damage with a little bit of math because Karl or the LoS boss didn't have enough health. We took the base impact damage (150k) and determined ours was 6.5x higher (975k / 150k = 6.5). With that we scaled up the base damage with ticks from 225k to about 1.5m (225k x 6.5 = ~1.5m). Realistically, the damage is probably closer to 1.2m or 1.3m after ticks unless you can keep your target frozen for the duration of the ticks.




**Final Thoughts**

This is a niche application but there may be scenarios where it will work, the main requirement being that the divinity person has to  be far enough to proc Sundering Glare - If you add more people to the equation it becomes easier to perform. The problem with adding more people is that you quickly do less damage than if you just had 2 Thundercrashes. 

The biggest thing making this hard to accomplish is the tiny window you have to hit the boss while frozen before they break out or Divinity breaks them out. If you can control that better, you can more reliably hit the big number. However without the frozen buff, you can still hit 780k impact (~1.17m with ticks), which is still a very large number."

0,Constellation found in Shuro Chi's encounter under the Gazebo?," Hi guys, prepare a therapy session for me after this one. You will think that I am crazy but I did my best and I want to hear your opinion about this subject. Let’s begin.

**Context:**  
3-4 months ago, me and my friend were exploring through the last wish raid, we arrived to Shuro Chi, we climbed the rock and went straight to the puzzles and stuff, our primary reason for that was to “explore” cuz we were bored and verifiy if the wish plates are still there, why? As we know, Titan (which had 1 of the plates behind that door) was vaulted and we thought they might just remove or move them or something. After a few minutes, my friend called me under a gazebo to show me something that was shining, there was a “galaxy design” but with a few stars brighter then others. Shining, fading and doing their animation. My friend told me there should be something.. maybe a puzzle or something, I called him crazy at first, even tho- he was kinda right, the stars were a bit suspect at this point. My mind was like: This raid is old, there should be a post or something here, right? I couldn’t find any. But, I wasn’t really into this theory. After a while, I was thinking if there could be any puzzles left or any easter eggs besides 15th wish. After a while, there it was:

**Beginning:**

I was in my physics class (don’t ask) when I was thinking about the star map (https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLuETOCJ3rwAYy-IoYYxD-C\_bg1yQ8uvup&amp;v=k9QJEoxcPjo) that Shuro Chi presented us in a patrol mission. I linked it to trailers based on: Dreaming, **Stars**, Future, Curse and other key words. I was marked by: “**That map isn’t just decoration**”. Which made me think about other decorations that can lead to something. Maybe the stars found in Shuro Chi encounter?..

**Finding a ramp:**

After school I went to Shuro Chi encounter in Last Wish raid and thought about possible position of the stars. Why you might ask. Because, apparently all these stars are in a different place then the others. The stars are not disappearing (just fading), or moving. Some are brighter then others (like in real life), but It isn’t just decoration.. At least I feel like it. I took some screenshots and move it to photoshop where I tried to highlight with a different color and try to link them. But before that, I found others interesting things. Like:

**Shuro Chi standing place is part of the “star map”? (**I think that was known before, I couldn’t find it tho-**): https://imgur.com/a/qDE1Qnh**

**Shuro Chi plates has a design like wish plates (**Old and known, but might be useful in the future**): https://imgur.com/a/VLD5HSM**

**Stars are visible in the dark side of the Whisper of the Worm scope (**Some other light are visible too, but others.. even brighter, are not**):  https://imgur.com/a/8LppR0D**

**https://imgur.com/a/WXSoIcH**

(Not necessary helpful but It might say something about the lighting effect of the stars) 

**And more things like that (I will update this list if needed).**

**Theory 1** 

The stars are actually constellations from real life. We got the 4 categories in the “wall of wishes” symobl list: Fish, Dragon, Eagle/Bird, Snake. And we got constellation for every category AND some versions of it:

**FISH (Pisces): https://imgur.com/a/gXcGhHu**

**EAGLE (Aquila): same link**

**DRAGON (Draco): same link**

**SNAKE (Serpens): same link**

**..and some derivations of their main constellation like: Flying fish, water snake and others.**

Maybe we can link the stars from the gazebo in a pattern like the stars in real life and find symbols from wall of wishes. That can lead to a code that opens something if you introduce it in wall of wishes not necessary “15th wish”, mby?

**Theory 2**

The stars don’t relate to the stars in real life and we have to link them ourselves in order to find the correct symbol.

For example (from real life): https://imgur.com/a/42jaRvw

I found a dragon inside this gazebo: https://imgur.com/a/InO4qrS

This can be an infinite snake: https://imgur.com/a/XucFmOe

And the list goes on.

That was the first thing that I thought about. Maybe I wasn’t wrong, maybe I was.

**Theory 3**

Maybe we can make a map out of this stars which can lead up to somewhere on dreaming city. Why is that a possible Theory? Due to the fact that if you watch the map of the dreaming city, we can see some white stars similar to the gazebo stars

What I mean:

**Why I believe it can lead up to something?**

I think we can get something out of this because, as we know, Bungie left us with a “teaser” or maybe a hint linked to 15 eyes in a cutscene in the middle of the space, like a constellation. It was related to 15th wish. You can read more about this in this reddit post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep\_stone\_crypt\_cutscene\_constellation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep_stone_crypt_cutscene_constellation/)

Maybe Bungie tried to remind us about this little “puzzle”. Also, any progress on the Deep Stone Crypt Theory? Let me know.

Also, these gazebos are different from the others, not even Petra’s have those type of stars.

Maybe we can also form a constellation on that DSC constellation and link to Shuro Chi’s stars, somehow.

**Making of the code**

Ok, let’s pretend it is an possible theory. But.. How can we make a code after that?

Let’s say we include it in the wall of wishes. How are we sorting the code?

**Methode 1**

Some gazebo have a circular part around it: https://imgur.com/a/hRquntZ

We can consider it like a sorting mechanism where these parts represents the fact that the symbol is in the middle of other 4 symbols or 4 spaces.

Or, we can consider the little lamps some sort of positioning order or something like that.

**Methode 2**

We place it in the order of the encounter and position on the map. In different position based on the level of the gazebo and other place factors.

**Methode 3**

We can place every stars and make a map out of it which in that situation we can’t use wall of wishes out of that. Or we can unite only the brighter stars.

**Methode 4**

We link every gazebo and paste it inside the wall of wishes, after that we can count the number of bullets we need to use based on stars that are filled in the circles.

**We can try everything to sort it.**

**Conclusion**

This could be a great puzzle if it is supposed to be like that. Hope you understand what I am saying cuz I don’t have a great english overall. I hope this will lead to something, else.. I will get Therapy."

‘FRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Smuggler's switches still working. Maintenance side-hatch. Had to kick in the vent.’

This, quite clearly, is a clue to a smugglers compartment stated in the ‘Tucked away’ triumph. 12 lore pages suggests 12 smugglers compartments.

These compartments seemingly are attributed to the yellow-rimmed screens found lying around the place. In your next run, you’ll find that the first of of these you come across can now be activated, opening a door and revealing a chest (which for me contained an ‘at power level’ piece of gear). After finishing this run and after a lot of snooping, there are in fact 12 of these pads lying around throughout the mission, which adds up. Sadly however, you don’t get another piece of lore if you complete it again. My guess that it is going to be 1 captains log page per week.

By checking on Light.gg, each of the log books does have a clue at the end of it, lets hope 12 weeks of effort is worth it!

Other notable items I found that seemingly will be scanable in the coming weeks are; 

- a yellow data pad in the room with the large cabal ship, after the room with the two ultra abominations
- a dead scorn which appears to be on an examining table 
- a dead ghost in the area before the rally flag point
- a chalice under the walkway in the very final room

I guess it's kind of useless cause you can't do too much while you're there, but if you wanted to do stuff in the main patrol areas without being disturbed, that's a good way to do it.

0,"“Presage” Solo Flawless, Trash Compactor Encounter Cheese","Just a quick one for anyone attempting solo flawless on this great new quest.

From what I’ve been able to see so far, the majority of players are wiping during the Trash Compactor encounter, forcing them to reset their runs again and again.

This is largely due to the RNG factor which the spawning/ placement of where the fuses will appear. Every time the compactor fully “closes” and then resets, the fuses have a chance to move.

So here’s a way that I discovered to just eliminate all of those problems in one go:

So I was just doing the usual Strike playlist, nothing to crazy, but then i got loaded into a strike somewhere in the tangled shore, no dialogue, no indication of a mission, nothing.  


The strike started in one of the crashed Dreadnaught ships, there was only one wy deeper, with a bunch of Hive worshipping their worship like they always do.  
Me and my fireteam consisting of random players proceeded to kill them, but then there was just nothing else to do, only a door with a giant seal on it.   
I looked around there to find a way deeper in there, or some way to carry on the strike, but there was nothing.  


Then i tried backtracking, and i ended up in the Jetsam of Saturn, once there i saw some of these wierd bubbles, like some hive broodcells. I shot them and once i did that my game just crashed, and I had no way of returning to that strike.  
I looked for it on the Tangled Shore, as well as the other Destinations (just to be safe, not that i excpected it to be there)  


As i mentioned, i just wanted to post that on here, maybe that'll be something, or bungie just made a mistake there. And i really wish that i had prove for that, because i didnt see any of it on google, and my ShadowPlay didnt work for me there."

0,Bungie Foreshadowing 'The Darkness' in D1 and D2's Latest Exotic Quest 'Presage'?,"Bungie loves teasing what's to come several months ahead of time, hell even years before we get to see these major story beats unfold in front of our very eyes. The Darkness is a prime example of this. Since 2014, The Darkness has been the main antagonist of the Destiny Universe but was never directly addressed in major story plot points until Destiny 2's post credit cutscene. Before then it was only mentioned and talked about in grimoire cards back in D1. On the topic of 'The Darkness' and Grimoire cards... Take a look at the image of this Grimoire card called 'The Darkness' from D1.

Do you see it? Look at how undeniably similar the artwork from the card and the new environmental assets in the quest are. They are almost identical if not the same thing. The spores are glowing blue and growing from a foundation just like in the image from the card. The vein/tendril looking things are also sprouting from them just like on the image of the card as well the in game ones. Coincidence? I think not... However we are not done yet. Now it is time to connect these things with the darkness itself.

After shooting these spores you gain an effect called 'Egregore Link'. When you have this effect you are able to pass through these glowing, burning barriers which Osiris calls darkness radiation or energy. Now what is an Egregore? A quick google search:

**Egregore** (also spelled **egregor**; from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) *égrégore*, from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language) *egrḗgoros* 'wakeful') is an [occult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult) concept representing a distinct [non-physical entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity) that arises from a collective group of people. Historically, the concept referred to angelic beings, or [watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(angel)), and the specific rituals and practices associated with them, namely within [Enochian traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian_magic).

Very interesting stuff... Non physical entity? Sound familiar? The darkness has been described many times in lore to be a non physical entity. What is 'Enochian traditions'?

**Enochian magic** is a system of [ceremonial magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_magic) based on the evocation and commanding of various [spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit). It is based on the 16th-century writings of [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee) and [Edward Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley), who claimed that their information, including the revealed [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian) language, was delivered to them directly by various angels. Dee's journals contained the [Enochian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian), and the tables of correspondences that accompany it. Dee and Kelley believed their visions gave them access to secrets contained within the [*Book of Enoch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch).

Could this be a hint to our next set of powers? Very interesting stuff. The second word, 'Link' of the effect 'Egregore Link' seems to suggest that we have connected with this fungus or infection, spiritually to allow us to pass through it's barriers. Without it we seemingly burn when touching the barrier. Now look at the effect around the borders of your screen when you have this effect applied to your guardian:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y62aeOnRyGZeicE9QRNCAC8CBu--wcwE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y62aeOnRyGZeicE9QRNCAC8CBu--wcwE/view?usp=sharing)

Where else have we seen this effect before? Take a look at these...

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6Xc\_XF-bpFWcwO\_DUE1GKQ0gO-dVKC1/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6Xc_XF-bpFWcwO_DUE1GKQ0gO-dVKC1/view?usp=sharing)

That's right. The pyramid's barriers which Ghost also calls a massive energy spike. Does this connect whatever these tendrils and infestations are with the darkness directly? Going by the Grimoire card image resemblance to the in game assets as well as the visual connections with the pyramid's barriers, I think it is safe to say that there is definitely a deliberate connection here. However there is still one more thing to discuss...

The Drifter.

There is only one other place that we have seen these tendrils before and it is inside the Drifter's ship. Take a look at this.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TmuDR-wiiX4NRAttHIXv4k3Yp57iMPI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TmuDR-wiiX4NRAttHIXv4k3Yp57iMPI/view?usp=sharing)

You see them? Back in season of the drifter, you could go around the back of his ship to an icy area with these tendrils again and a tent with a tape recording in it. In the lore that came with season of the drifter, the Drifter explains and describes a trip that he went on with his crew to an icy planet. On this planet he said there were creatures that emitted an aura of pure darkness which repressed light. When they got close, his crew members lost their light and died in their sleep to the cold. The ice surrounding the room with the tent in it could be bungie trying to show a basic visual description as to what this place looked like. Throwing the container tent in there could also be a direct reference to the tent they were sleeping in whilst on that planet. Unfortunately I do not have an image of this room but I'm sure there are various videos out there where you can see it. Here is an image in the gambit prep room.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLx-W-AGIDcIXb8QSVZauANGweJED8fy/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLx-W-AGIDcIXb8QSVZauANGweJED8fy/view?usp=sharing)

So what does this all mean? Could this be the start of a new enemy race being foreshadowed? When could we expect to see these creatures that drifter saw? Judging by the story direction I think Lightfall is the most likely candidate for when we'll see these things arrive. This is all very interesting and quite deliberate referencing from bungie and so I definitely believe that we are in some state of foreshadowing for bigger things to come... and this is only the beginning. Expect more small hints as the seasons move forward whether they are physical or visual representations in game or through lore.

One last thing I forgot to mention is the black armoury papers' description on these creatures as well. 'Smell of wet earth and sound like a machine being stretched and then compressed'. This is some concept art from bungie on something that fits this description. Also when you are moving throughout the mission's tunnels and small spaces you can hear groans and breathing which fits this description of the papers. Whether those noises are from that scorn boss or not it still sounds rather distinct. However this could be a stretch.

Thanks for reading my post, let me know what you think.

Ps. If anyone from Bungie sees this, tell the talented team that they did an amazing job with this quest. From visuals to storytelling, sound design and gameplay. Pure Awesomeness. This is what makes Destiny unique. Keep it up!

In the dark maze area (you know the one where you drop down through the floor with the effect active) there is a small door that looks similar to the trash compactor door.  To open it, Proceed as you normally would in the maze to complete it. As soon as you pull the lever that is found immediately after exiting the maze, go back in the maze and find the door before the effect wears off. It’s now open. It opens a hallway with a small window that requires the effect to get through. Get the effect and go through. Unfortunately it’s completely empty and a dead end.


Our thoughts were a potential chest location in the future? Or a chest spawns there after completing something? Either way we we weren’t sure, but pumped to find a secret. Maybe you all can find something else out?"

0,How powerful is our guardian and how under-powered/leveled are other guardians in-game?,"So I want to start off by saying that our Guardian is probably the highest ""power"" level of any of the guardians besides the vanguard and the main cast (Osiris, Ana, etc) maybe even more powerful than them. 

At the start of the red war (Making a new character) everyone had the same armor, weapons, etc. However, as time progressed and we've gained more powerful, no other guardian seem to be anywhere close to our power, which has been bothering me for a while. Our guardian has high stat/high quality armor and gear. Our weapons are extremely good and we almost always have an exotic and always have at least 3.

We've seen other in-game characters like the Dredgen in that Drifter cutscene and now we've seen another guardian (the one in the new mission) The Dredgen uses the makeshift Thorn, and Shards and other Legendary gear but he has been around a while to know Drifter and about Shin. However, the guardian in the new mission is using all WHITE or Common gear but he had an exotic. So that begs the question, if the ordinary guardian is still using white/common gear than how overpowered is our guardian. 

That guardian in the mission wasn't a new light either, he had done quite a few runs of the Menagerie and is even well aquatinted with Calus; and again, he is using common gear, so I would say new lights are even worse off.  

Now I understand why the vanguard loses 9+ guardians in a simple strike, everyone/the average guardian, uses common gear..."

Or does something else trigger them to activate?

I think they are linked to a secret which may not be time gated because some people can interact with them."
0,[SPOILERS] The Presage variation missions and the Crown of sorrow.,"\[Note, this is both a data mine and a glitch post.\]

From the datamined voicelines and dialogue, there is a variation of the Presage exotic mission where you talk and investigate **with Caiatl.** The reason why she is here is that she wants to investigate what happened to her father, Calus, and capture/punish him. We investigate the ship with her and Osiris, but the voice lines mention **the crown of sorrow, and how it not only controls minds but merges them. I presume we later either find and investigate it or fight enemies corrupted by it, but again these are only presumptions.** Also, JLoughlen on Twitter went out of bounds and found the crown of sorrow on the Glykon. Here is the video that shows you how to go oob and find it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f\_6b3hOCA0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_6b3hOCA0k)

**Here is also the image of the crown of sorrow in the oob area:** [https://imgur.com/mPvda4N](https://imgur.com/mPvda4N)

Normally if you smoke grenade yourself, you get no melee energy.

Throw a smoke far away, run into it after it explodes.

When you become invis you will also get half melee energy. 

Because you didn't become invis immediately it thought you were an ally and granted melee energy. Doing this with a friend will give you a full smoke from the ally, then yourself. Combine this with 100 mobility and gamblers dodge and you can have infinite invisibility while solo. 2 smokes used then returned to 2 smoke charges. (2 halves + 1 Gamblers dodge every 11-14 seconds)"

0,Speculating on the Exotic Scout Rifle,"We know it is a Tex Mechanica scout rifle, and so is highly likely lever-action. This makes me think it will fire at a unique RPM for scouts, something like 100 RPM with higher, harder-hitting damage. It could be balanced by having to reload bullets individually into an internal tube magazine (a common design component of lever-action rifles). This would explain giving the rifle a (datamined) perk like “Cranial Spike” that gradually increases reload for chaining precision shots, as you would be able to rapidly hasten the process of individually loading rounds. 
The rifle probably has a magazine of around 14 bullets, and I honestly expect it to have very high damage for a scout rifle, if not closer to a hand cannon. The drawback of this high damage is probably a relatively slow fire rate (having to manually rack the lever to rechamber after firing) and a low zoom factor - the gun seems to have iron sights.
I’d expect some form of “Gunslinger’s Trance” perk allowing you to increase the RoF by chaining precision shots, allowing you to increase its versatility in PVE. 
Personally I just hope the levering animation and sound design are great. This thing should sound gritty and powerful, like it really kicks. Nothing fancy here."

Someone who is better at sparrow flying may be able to find an OOB and explore the pyramid, but these videos show what I was able to find.

0,shit-post theory (not really),"To cut to the chase, what if our guardians are actually being ""corrupted"" by Savathun? And she's currently deceiving us to hearing other guardians like Crow and Shaxx whistle it. As our guardians know from Eris that's an enormous red flag. Assuming Savathun knows WE know, could it be possible we're actually being ""corrupted""? 

A reason why I think this is a possibility is due to how unbelievably powerful we are as guardians, killing gods and all that. As far as I'm aware, no one else (guardians specifically) has done that. Savathun obviously knows who we've killed, etc. So to me, it'd make sense why she'd use us as a pawn since we are so powerful. I don't see the traveler helping us since we sorta? sided with the darkness and achieving stasis.

Savathûn’s song, having been around for almost a year I believe, in game at least, is supposedly an infectious tune, that burrows deep into the listener’s mind, and acts as a switch, once flipped, doing bidding for the host, in this case Savathûn. If she truly is the god of trickery, and we have a largely assumed Hive DLC approaching, could this all be a trick? 

Savathûn surely hates guardians, we’ve been there, figured that out for quite a long time. Thus, we keep hearing about the song, not always what it means (besides a few times), but we hear it. We hear it and know that whoever does so is infected, and sometimes, infected must be put down.

What happens when Savathûn decides to ‘activate’ one of these agents, one such like Shaxx, whose had his Ahamkara whispering into his ear for so long? We have to put them down, they are exiled, whatever we can do to make sure they won’t harm people. Recently, our semi-freshly revived avian friend has been whistling the tune to himself, but who would he have heard the song from? Shaxx has his bones, Eris has vast knowledge, but could have easily been corrupted by the eyes she’s placed within herself.

The point is, we have to deal with people when they’ve been ‘activated’, in a way that protects others. What if Savathûn is using this to her advantage? What if perhaps, the Crow isn’t whistling the obscure hive tune, perhaps Shaxx’s ‘Moon Cheese Song’ never happened, or if it did, perhaps it happened differently. 

What if we, as a guardian had heard the song, nobody else, save for the rest of us around on this post, and floating around the EDZ in orbit. What if we had been ‘activated’ already, and these tunes we’re hearing are Savathûn playing with us, turning our suspicions towards fellow guardians rather than her? 

Now for a really big stretch. What if Savathûn’s song had been with us for so much longer? What if her song was around when Cayde-6 died? Maybe Uldren deserved it, but what if like him, we weren’t thinking clearly ourselves? The Hive definitely have a connection with the black fleet, worshipping them, and Uldren just so happened to be corrupted by Riven herself, an Ahamkara just as the one that hangs above our Crucible master? Perhaps Uldren wasn’t just corrupted by ‘Darkness’, but rather Savathûn’s song? She’s already made deals with Riven before.

What if we are doing what she wants us to do? All of these things, where we’re hearing her tune burrow deep into our minds, where Shaxx sings for Saladin, what if they never truly happened that way? 

While the part about Forsaken is definitely not true, I think that there’s at least some small shred of information in here that may come true. We’re all hoping that the Witch Queen DLC has some extreme plot twists to play off of Savathûn’s nature, maybe this is it.


TL;DR: I think Savathûn has been controlling us, and the instances we here her song are false, her turning us against our own.

Thanks for reading this overly long, and half-baked theory, would love to here your thoughts!"

0,[SPOILERS] Nessus tank datamine information (Proving grounds strike),"From the Ginsor datamine, there are a ton of things about the season waiting to be uncovered. A few things I uncovered were about the Proving Grounds strike we are getting later in the season, and I will share some with you.   


* The Land tank is called the ""**Halphas Electus**.""
* The boss is not Caiatl, but Caiatl's ""chosen,"" who is called **Ignovun, chosen of Caiatl.** 
* Ignovun's helm was crafted by Psions and gives Ignovun the power of Psions themselves.
* Some text strings found include: ""Caiatl's chosen warrior waits deep within her fortified tank. But if we lose, we surrender Nessus and support her claim to the imperial throne,"" and “The Rite of Proving is over. By the victor's rule, the Halphas Electus, and the souls aboard it, are yours to destroy.”
* Another line is ""Overload power systems in the undercarriage section of the strike Proving Grounds,"" and there's also ""Eliminate all Cabal VIPS in the strike Proving Grounds.""
* ""Empress Caiatl has deployed a tank fortress to Nessus and opened an invitation to survivors of the Red Legion to **vie for a seat on her War Council.** Vanquish the Cabal and prove yourself in glorious combat against her Chosen. Join a fireteam of three and face the forces of Empress Caiatl.""
* ""Commander Zavala has informed you that **you have been chosen to fight for the City aboard the Imperial Land Tank, the Halphas Electus, on Nessus.** Caiatl has accepted the challenge. Zavala tells you to assemble your fireteam and bring Caiatl's champion to their knees. He reminds you that if Caiatl suffers defeat here, she will have no choice but to concede or risk humiliation.""

Extra: There's a line that talks about winning something, possibly winning in the strike or becoming the new ""champion."" It also says when that happens, Caiatl will cease all hostilities and her forces will never set foot on Earth again. **It also says that Zavala will become ""Bracus Zavala"" and will serve on Caiatl's war council.**  


**If there's anything I missed or didn't say about the strike and the Halphas Electus, please feel free to tell me in the comments below.

0,[TONS OF SPOILERS] The Glykon and the Dead Man's tale.," When looking into the 10,000 text strings that Ginsor datamined, I noticed a lot of interesting things about the new mission for the season exotic weapon we are getting.  

* The quest and mission for the exotic are called “Presage,” definition is a sign or warning. 
* The mission is onboard the **Glykon (Volatus)**, a cabal ship that used to be Calus's that disappeared and reappeared in reef space. 
* A guardian sent a distress signal with an encoded Loyalist signature used by **Calus**, so that means Caiatl is also investigating. It also says Caiatl helped us with the investigation, maybe meaning we'll hear dialogue from her in the mission since there are lines directed at her. 
* We need to discover clues inside of the Glykon, including a smuggling compartment. 
* The guardian that sent the distress signal says that if we get him out of the ship, he will offer his rifle, presumably the dead man's tale. 
* He also forged a replacement trigger assembly, and we have to look for it. Whatever that is.
* We are supposed to find clues in the ship, and instead of wine, there is concentrated dark ether on the ship similar to Gahlrain’s chamber in the royal baths. The text strings also mention the **crown of sorrow** multiple times, maybe the mission or another quest’s main objective is recovering or doing something with the crown of sorrow. 
* Dead man’s tale is an exotic lever-action scout rifle and a custom craft tex machina weapon that was never reported to the vanguard. 
* The catalyst is gotten through kills, but also **“hidden caches”** onboard the Glykon.
* From another Reddit source: ""Skull Piercing"" Consecutive precision hits grant extra damage bonus and the Catalyst ""Dark Forged Trigger"" Increase hip fire speed and accuracy.
* Presage mission has a master difficulty and there are many trackers based on time, carries, etc. 

There is a lot more about the Glykon in the text strings I haven't fully understood or uncovered yet, so feel free to search in this github link here: [https://gist.github.com/Ginsor/92f15c8cd29da05ad1e0a7beecaf1aff](https://gist.github.com/Ginsor/92f15c8cd29da05ad1e0a7beecaf1aff)

0,Few changes to Atraks I noticed after chosens patch,"All the previous shanks in the atraks encounter were called tracer shanks yet fired the same way a vandal would, now they have wire rifles which hurt a bit harder

During the down phases on each floor and the time between the first 4 and second 4 damage phases significantly more ads now spawn in, snipers, dregs, wretches and maybe more all spawn in pretty consistantly.

The break between the servitors spawning and the atraks damage phase seems significantly shorter, we were struggling to get 6 people up to the top before it started.

This is really anecdotal and will probably be extremely hard to test but I feel like everything is doing a ton more damage to you, we had a few deaths to adds compared to the usual absolute stomping of the raid.

And another note with my current colourblind settings ( yellow-blue ) the operator and scanner are completely indistinguishable.

0,Beyond Light title screen represents a new era of destiny,"When you boot up destiny now and you wait for the title card you'll notice what looks like a triangle stacked on top of a circle. My theory is that the triangle represents the darkness striking 12 and starting a new era in the universe and that things will be changing. The arrival of the darkness has also begun to redo what it has done before as shown and why the triangle and circle move counterclockwise as if to symbolize the idea of our progress in the new golden age comes to an end as we begin the new dark age.

I'm probably over exaggerating things but one of my theory's is that it's related to Savathun or something because they came from Wrathborn which were controlled by the Hive Celebrant I don't know if it's some kind of puzzle or something or just something that's decodable?

In doing so I found an article on said app about the new Scout Rifle coming soon. 

I used my phone camera apps ""auto translate"" to get the rough English discription, from what I can tell 

the main perk is called ""Skull Piercing"" Consecutive precision hits grant extra damage bonus

and the Catalyst ""Dark Forged Trigger"" Increase hip fire speed and accuracy.

There is also some implication to lore (rough translation from chinese): ""In terms of plot, a guardians invitation to Karus (encouraged). Go down and catch the Kabar ship with the crown of grief contempt for the family (Scorn, Charm), want to extract drakness for research. When the keeper and kabar logged onto the ship ,they found out, The flouting clan above is endless, and it is immediately resurrectd by dark energy. Last keeper and kabbah trapped in the ship, the keepers dexterity was infected by the darkness and the keeper had to shoot himself at TA's dexterity.""

Clearly there is a lot of incorrect translations throughout but the main gist can be seen.

So obviously siva still remains in the game to some extent, through some ornaments and other eververse cosmetics having siva themes, as well as Outbreak Perfected.

However this season we got a new anarchy ornament with siva on it, but this season isn't linked to raasputin and is about the cabal. 

As well as this, Lord Saladin has also been given a bit of story significance in cutscenes and voice lines etc. The last time he was given a main role in a story was 4 years ago when Rise of Iron dropped in D1, where we fought, you guessed it, Siva. With Bungie's new model of an expanding storyline, Lord Saladin should continue to play a part in the storyline and siva may come with him.

0,Next week’s nightfall and season 13 Iron Banner,"Parisito1234 made a post outlining findings on the seasonal Challenges [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/lh6n7v/all_season_of_the_chosen_challenges/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) based on these findings, some things can be determined:

Iron banner will happen weeks 3 and 10, both of these weeks have seasonal challenges related to iron banner

Week 8 has a challenge specifying that the ordeal during that week is going to be the new strike Proving Grounds. Assuming they keep the same 6-week nightfall rotation structure, this means that week 2 (next week) will also be proving grounds nightfall. Oddly enough the first challenge related to GM’s is actually on week 6, so it will not be able to be completed for a week.

Someone else in the comments of that post noted that the new exotic quest may release week 5 with the challenge “Investigate cryptic notes left in the captains log“"

0,All Season of the Chosen challenges,"Greetings Guardians

Rummaging around in the API has revealed *every single seasonal challenge, broken down by week*. I have compiled all of the information for you to view here.

As always - I've created a [Google Sheet with all of the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jQ1-QzsZKAyenmTgLhpoZ42R1J9LmUI47JR5EAu8wM/edit?usp=sharing). I trust the app devs will make this data available on their platforms soon enough, but this is what is currently available to us.

Weekly bounties have been consolidated and slimmed down to better fit the season while still encouraging weekly play of more than just a few hours via strikes, crucible, gambit, and battlegrounds. As we progress later into the season, the challenges grow in size but decrease in volume - so we have to do less things but they're harder to do.

This list is subject to change, since some of the objectives and rewards seem pretty slim and not fully fleshed out, so we'll see what changes in the future other than the 2 redacted objectives that likely have to do with the exotic and the ship.

Happy Hunting!"

0,(regarding the leaked Zvala-Crow scene ) full info here,"&amp;#x200B;

**Story highlights** :

an assassination attempt is in motion to take down Zvala in the City by one of  Caiatl's councilors after a truce was made.

The Crow managed to stealth his way to the City reaching Ikora &amp; Osiris explaining to them all about the plot.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Osiris:**  *Make your preparations. I'll reach out to Caiatl to discuss this.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Glint:**  *If we do not end this, it will escalate beyond our control. The City is at risk.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ikora :** *Keep your mask on. Always. Do not speak. Can I trust you to handle this with discretion?*  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Crow:**  *I should have kept my mask on, but I don't regret acting. I still think Zavala's in danger.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Mission descriptive :**

^(The Elite Psion you encountered on The City is plotting something. Help Crow investigate this further. Here you'll find the assets and information you need to complete our most time-sensitive operation.)

&gt;**Crow to Osiris:**  *You seem like a wise man.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:** *We both know that the best victory is won before the war even begins. I'm giving humanity a way out.*  *The Cabal have lost their home, not their honor. If we're to die, we will take many with us.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Crow:**  *Wait… you aren't going to tell the commander? This concerns him. He deserves to know.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ikora:** *This isn't the first time an enemy has infiltrated the City, and it won't be the last.*  *This is not an easy decision. You know that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Glint:**  *We need to act now.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:**  *We don't want Lord Saladin walking in while we're discussing this, trust me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Crow:**  *After everything the Cabal have done to us. After Ghaul! We are warriors. Why aren't we at war?*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Guardian:**  *If you want to repay me, keep that mask affixed to your face. It will protect you from the City's ignorance.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:** *I doubt such attempt to take down the commander can slip out of the empress fingers like that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ghost:** *if she's the one behind it, and Zvala knows after the truce. I can only think of an imminent clash that both sides can't handle.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ikora:** *This won't happen. If I truly understand him, he would prioritize the City over his fury.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*.. Zavala will challenge her to ceremonial combat, she must accept—or risk losing that support.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Humanity's champion versus the Cabal's. The winner dictates the future.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:**  *If we win, there's no guarantee Caiatl's followers will honor the result. Even if the empress herself does. That said, a lot of them are just as unhappy Caiatl tried to fold us into the empire.*"

The blacked out silhouette is the same shape as super good advice.

It also seems that this will be included in the base game since it has the destiny logo as the season identifier. I can see that they bring back the gun with the same perks, but it doesn't have a unique intrinsic. If anyone doesn't know, it originally had crowd control (rampage) and super good advice (mulligan). Could be a good replacement for 21% delirium, due to its perks and relatively high rate of fire.

Thanks for reading."
0,Likely Perks for the REDACTED Quest Exotic,"Did some digging through the Ginsor Text Dump

Likely Intrinsic Perk: Cranial Spike -  Chaining precision hits grants bonus damage and quickens reload speed. 

Catalyst: Dark-Forged Trigger -  Increased hipfire rate of fire and removes hipfire accuracy penalties

Some guys in discord shared the season 13 press kit. Under screenshots section is an ""exotic quest"" file. It shows pictures of that abandoned ship from the trailer.
I think most people suspected this, but here it is anyway.

0,Transfering ARMOR between different classes using Destiny2 App,"Apologies if this is already common knowledge but I have never seen anything about this.

I accidentally just transferred some armor from my warlock to my titan instead of my vault using the app. The transfer was successful, meaning this could be used to help with power levelling?

I won't have chance to test in-game until later today but just wanted to post in case this is helpful to others in any way."

0,Possible Divinity Cheese," 

Hey r/raidsecrets, longtime lurkers here, comprising of u/CaleSpen,  u/boiofsteel and u/Pacchimari had embarked on the journey to get divinity and needless to say, we were exhausted and tired of a horrible experience from LFGing as we were always short a few members (most of my clan plays on PS4 but I’m on PC). The hope of a shorter run by backtracking from the boss for a way quicker div run was patched out as of the 3.0.2 Beyond light update. Represented by the huge ass locked door which leads the way out from the 3rd encounter ( https://imgur.com/a/fXjaKYI)  


This marked the end of our divine hopes, or so we thought. We glitched out of the map using a no turn back zone to cross the locked door and reach the other side, and then backtrack all the way to the first encounter to start the divinity puzzle and platforming with Salvation’s grip ( ol’ reliable weapon yes?). Then again, we were stuck at the door, and how to cross it.  
Once we end up on the other side of the door, one can navigate to the extreme left of the path where the door sits and climb up on the little platform, and then use salvation’s grip to get to the roof and cross the door. Since this is the same instance of the raid, divinity will be obtainable.

Lo and behold we ended up at the other side of the door, successfully being able to start and complete the divinity puzzles, and beat the boss to get the raid exotic. Note that a boss CP is required for this to work (duh)  
Here’s the link to the full video guide for the glitch :)  
https://youtu.be/3u4EN1uVQ2Y  


We sadly could not get the 4th box and onward to spawn so currently there’s no way to complete the quest, but we found this to be cool nonetheless and wanted to share it with the community  


If any content creators want to make a video on it, make sure to give credit to all 3 members of this post, and you are good to go :)

Keep the cheeses coming!"

0,Unmentioned evidence for the H.E.L.M. location in the repaired Old Tower.,"Firstly, I want to apologise if anything in this post has been previously posted. I’ve done my research and I believe the ideas in this post are original and my own, inspired by what I have seen and read. I’ve included the Foreshadowing section as context but its nothing new, so feel free to skip to the Cubemap and Trailer sections for my findings.

**Foreshadowing**

If there’s one thing that we know for sure, its that Bungie doesn’t tend to put work in to areas that don’t get use in the game, and they certainly don’t post things by accident.

One ‘accident’ however took place during Season of Arrivals, where the PlayStation Store updated their emblem for Destiny 2 to the image here - [New Evidence May Reveal Destiny 2’s End Of Season Event Ahead Of ‘Beyond Light’ (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/10/25/new-evidence-may-reveal-destiny-2s-end-of-season-event-ahead-of-beyond-light/?sh=259905992a34). This so-called leak became the catalyst for theories around a return to the original Tower and a reformed Traveller. At the end of the season, we witnessed the traveller heal before the release of beyond light, lending credit to the image as a new image and not one of the landscape during the D1 era. Additionally, posts on this subreddit detailed the subtle structural differences between the Tower in the linked image and the D1 Tower.

Sure enough, when we logged in on release day the Tower was still the regular D2 Tower. One thing had changed however – the Old Tower, destroyed 3 years ago, was now bearing signs of repairs taking place. Scaffolding and construction cranes were situated around the base of the Old Tower after no change to its design in so many years and expansions.

It is my belief that Bungie has been subtly sending signals that the Old Tower will be repaired and returned to the game over the course of this year. The question was not IF the Tower will return, but rather WHEN will it return.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cubemap vs. the Destiny 1 Tower**

This week gave us the trailer reveal for the upcoming season. In this trailer I spotted a couple of potential clues that would confirm the H.E.L.M is in fact situated in the repaired D1 Tower.

Firstly, there is the datamined Old Tower cubemap - [Destiny Cubemaps (montaguem.com)](http://montaguem.com/cubemaps?cubemap=environments_57?ver=v2922). Upon viewing, you will notice that this Tower map has significant differences from the D1 Tower. Primarily, the central red carpet, the large cut-out area at the front centre of the main courtyard platform, the different hanger area. Here is an image of the D1 Tower for reference - [https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Tower\_Plaza](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_Plaza).

It must be mentioned of course that the environment shown in the cubemap is subject to being scrapped or outdated and is no indication of release content. The idea that Bungie would allocate a chunk of its limited bandwidth to developing a new Tower social area, only to never release it, is a crazy one.

The cubemap shows some changes that would be consistent with Bungies description of the H.E.L.M. on their website. The H.E.L.M. is described as the “Vanguard staging ground”, and more importantly a “Spaceport”. Spaceports, by definition, house spaceships. More spaceships require more space, more space requires building alteration, extensions, or *an entirely new building with a large hanger*.

The cubemap shows just this, with a new large hanger area on the right and areas suitable for ship storage/docking on the main courtyard (potentially the triangular shapes in the ground). These are a new addition to the Tower map in comparison to the D1 Tower.

**Season of the Chosen Trailer and Website**

The trailer gave us a better look at the H.E.L.M. room, which overlooks the city from a different angle than the current tower, suggesting a new location. From my POV and with my FOV slider down, the position of the H.E.L.M. seems to be consistent with the Old Tower’s location.

Additionally, the main reason I made this post is to make some comparisons of the view seen through the H.E.L.M. window to the cubemap and D1 Tower.

Firstly, the image of that view - [Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/qkwk5o9). Ignoring the drawn arrows, you can see a red and grey shape on the middle right side of the image (between the red line and the glowing buildings). Upon closer inspection this looks very much like the postmaster’s building in the D1 Tower Courtyard, which does also appear in the cubemap. The cubemap again -  [Destiny Cubemaps (montaguem.com)](http://montaguem.com/cubemaps?cubemap=environments_57?ver=v2922).

Secondly, in the centre of the image to the left of the Titan’s hip you can see at least one cylindrical-ish structure which looks very much like the D1 courtyard vault situated opposite the postmaster. It has to be noted that the vaults do not appear in the cubemap (although the cubemap is by no means final).

Thirdly, playing the video slowly at this point, the view can be split into 3 visible levels of depth; the foreground (the Guardians in the H.E.L.M.), the middle-ground (the potential courtyard area, vaults and postmaster), and the background (the city). Close inspection of the relative movement of these different levels confirms the position of the H.E.L.M. as being positioned in the large Traveller-facing windowed room atop the tower.

This can be backed up by the structure of the H.E.L.M. window area, with the rounded window and two separators being consistent with the rounded Restored Tower window in the cubemap.

(The screenshot is from approx. 0.49 in the trailer, I recommend playing this part at a slow speed or going frame-by-frame to get a good look)

Additionally, the image posted on Bungies website for the H.E.L.M. featured an area seen through the window that resembles the new hanger area featured in the cubemap. The image is here -  [nVLnOt2.png (1363×566) (imgur.com)](https://i.imgur.com/nVLnOt2.png) . Notice the angle of the outside walls behind the flags. Also notice the subtle yellow accent. These are consistent with the updated hanger area shown in the cubemap and fit with the theme of the H.E.L.M. acting as a spaceport.

Edit: It's come up a couple of times in the comments now, so I'll say it in this post. The Old Tower does appear in the trailer in its destroyed form, alongside a Guardian and Iron Banner decorations. As per the season calendar, there are a couple of iron banner events on the calendar before the Guardian Games kick off. The most likely solution here is that the H.E.L.M. will launch as the only accessible part of the Old Tower, then over the course of the season the repairs will continue. The fact that the calendar separates the Guardian Games and the Guardian Games Closing Ceremony implies that there will be something significant happening during the ceremony. I believe the Old Tower, now the fully built H.E.L.M. will be accessible to players. This explains the separation of the games from the ceremony on the calendar as well as the shot of the unrepaired Tower in the trailer.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

· The presence of the vault and postmaster in the H.E.L.M. eliminates the possibility of it being an updated/new area in our current tower.

· The H.E.L.M. window design is consistent with the window seen in the rebuilt Tower cubemap.

· The H.E.L.M.s position is consistent with the Old Tower's position relative to the city.

· The structure spotted outside the H.E.L.M. window on the left is consistent with the Hanger design and position in the rebuilt Tower cubemap.

· The view in the trailer from the H.E.L.M. window also shows structures that look like the postmaster and vault in roughly their D1 Tower positions.

0,Potential Glitch in Thrallway 'Super-Nade',"Ok, so I found a glitch. I am not able to repeat it consistently. I have no idea if it can be useful or if it's a waste of time. I have not done a ton of testing on it. I was in the first Thrallway in shattered throne right after the Ogres in the rafters area. I was afk grinding grenade kills for the triumphs on a bottom tree solar titan. I was backed way into the corner against the fence where you can still farm XP, but I had to reposition the mouse every once in a while because the character slowly turns towards where no enemies come. I usually just point straight down because it takes longer for the character to move to the empty area and can easily survive a grenade going off even on his foot.

As a test, I thought maybe I could turn my back to the enemies and bounce it off the wall and have better luck not having to babysit him. So I took 1 step away from the fence and then jammed him into the corner [where the cross hairs are pointing.](http://imgur.com/a/DadOTQg) While facing horizontal (not up or down), into the corner, I threw a 'nade, but heard 8+ audio cues all on top of each other and died to the explosion on full health standing in a sunspot. I got it to happen twice more, seemingly randomly, but not since. Took me maybe 10-12 minutes. On the second one, my body went SAILING. Like, Prospector flag plant sailing.

Since I have no idea what matters, I'll just tell you everything. I had on the Hallowfire chest with discipline, melee resistance, and void resistance. All other armors had only discipline on. I was holding a Gnawing Hunger with demolitionist with a Hailing Confusion and Commemoration stowed. And I had on the Fusion Grenades."

Hello,

After some digging and code breaking, I have formulated a theory about the Cabal text at the end of the Season of the Chosen trailer. But first, how I got there:

**The alphabet**

Like many did after seeing the Cabal symbols at the end of the trailer, I began my search here at r/raidsecrets. I search for a cabal alphabet. I quickly found one [(this one)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8gkyfg/decoded_the_cabal_text_in_the_warmind_web_comic/) and started to decipher the code. Or so I thought. It turned out the code does not use any (that I'm aware off) letters from the Cabal alphabet. First solution busted. Onto the next.

**The Numbers (Mason, what do they mean?)**

My next step was to find a decoder for the Cabal numerical system. Again, my search led me here. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/71k3n2/cleaned_up_the_cabal_numbers/) linked me to a clean set of numbers I could use to decipher the message. However, this was easier said than done. Some symbols are flipped or upside down. Making it harder to decipher.

While I was deciphering, I noticed something. I had seen some of them before. My search led me into a deeper hole. Unfortunately I can no longer find the post that helped me further, but this post gave me a new insight. ***The first code we see in the trailer is similar to that of the Skyburners Command Beacon on the Dreadnaught. It's flipped, but otherwise completely the same.***

The rest of the code is all pretty hard to decipher because of the distortion, but [I found similarities](https://ibb.co/V216Zrk) between the code in the trailer and other Cabal symbols (for example: at the drill in one of the strikes).

**The theory**

The text shown in the trailer has major similarities to the Skyburners Command Beacon from the Dreadnaught and [the trailer even shows](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/744432512503119882/806184865329971270/unknown.png) (credit: u/pulpfree) the Skyburner's Oath symbol. I theorize that the ship we see in the trailer is an older Skyburner's ship which Calus uses to keep his Scorn (in some of the SotH armor, the lore talks about Calus abducting Scorn. ). There is a high probability this ship is floating around Phobos (Mars). Hinting at the fact the ship is 'corrupted' (?) and has shutdown. Also linking to Osiris' ""There is no light here"".

I have the weird feeling a god is playing with us as we speak. Controlling this game from the shadows. It requires more time to truly formulate a coherent theory for (I assume) Witch Queen.

u/MatrixDiamonds and  u/LettuceDifferent5104 talked about the ship being similar or maybe even the same as [The Cassini](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cassini). A concept art dating back to 2013, which would be a location that can be explored by players.

**Expanding the theory**

[Another theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/lc3rxo/discussing_the_no_light_ship_from_the_trailer_as/) by [u/mrmeep321](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrmeep321/) has come to my attention and I’d like to use it to further develop my theory of the Distress Call and the mysterious ship floating in space. 

[u/mrmeep321](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrmeep321/) and my theory clash on some points, but I believe that they can form a more coherent theory about a possible storyline. If you want to read the full theory, [you can here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/lc3rxo/discussing_the_no_light_ship_from_the_trailer_as/). To summarize MrMeep’s theory: he thinks the broken ship is floating around in the Kuiper belt and is overrun with Darkness. According to The Chronicon, Calus has sent some of his shadows to Athanaeum X, the planet on which the Drifter lost his crew and encountered the unknown creature of Darkness. MrMeep theorizes that the ship doesn’t hold Scorn, but rather these creatures.

Now, I don’t think the broken ship is floating in the Kuiper belt, but rather near Mars or Phobos. It is a Skyburners ship. I do think that  the broken ship can hold or shelter the creatures of Darkness. If the ship is truly overrun by Darkness, I cannot see why there would not be any of these creatures on board. That could be the reason for the Distress Call. And would lead back into MrMeep’s theory about the ship linking to the Redacted Exotic Quest.

***This makes me think that the first frame of the Distress Call is in fact THE Distress Call, an SOS if you will. The rest of the frames can be coordinates of the ship.*** Which means we might not have to translate. That doesn’t stop me though. I am searching for an answer regarding the Cabal language system.

**Possibility of storyline:**

* Calus came into contact with the highly ranked Skyburners and hired them to transport and guard captured Scorn (we have seen Skyburners guard high value targets before).
* The ship collects the Scorn from the Tangled Shore and return to their base near Phobos.
* The Darkness engulfs Mars, Titan, Io and Mercury, and thus the Cassini.
* A Distress Call is send (we know that takes ages as we saw during the time between the Taken King and the Red War).
* Empress Caiatl and Osiris(?) receive the call.
* Meanwhile, rampant scorn and creatures of Darkness overrun the broken ship.

0,Strange pillar above the Cosmodrome gangway tower.,"In the recent [Season of the Chosen Trailer](https://youtu.be/_XlFBp_ZmyE?t=71), when showing footage of the reprised Devils Lair strike there is a [strange beam/pillar above the right gangway tower](https://i.imgur.com/ki2AwZG.jpg) (or whatever those towers are) of the colony ship. This is the same tower that we went up during the [Cayde's Stash mission of The Taken King](https://youtu.be/t1oenwa-8lw?t=310)

Anyone have an idea what this thing is? It doesn't make sense to be a physical part of the tower and it terminates somewhere behind the rocket engines so we cannot see the top. I thought maybe some kind of fallen lift/tractor beam but that wouldn't lead anywhere and it is too dark to be that. 

Alternatively it could be some kind of graphical glitch. My best guess is that the elevator shaft from Devil's Spire zone is being incorrectly rendered in The Devils' Lair zone. But even this makes little sense as the [load zone between those areas happens before the elevator room](https://youtu.be/t1oenwa-8lw?t=353). and not during the elevator ride up. This would however explain why the pillar is so high however, as the impostered assets for the colony ship and gangway towers are both really small/short compared to the actual size of those locations.

Anyone have some insight here? Given the Fallen S.A.B.E.R. zones were part of TTK's additions to the Cosmodrome, I think it is feasible that he Devil's Spire bubble, another part of TTK, might be the culprit of this little anomaly, if it does return, I'll be curious as to what they'll do with it."

0,The HELM is most likely not in the current tower,"TLDR: The HELM is most likely a separate location in the last city and I believe that it takes place in a small section of the old tower and in season 14 the old tower will get fleshed out. Much like the cosmodrome this season and next season.

This is what the bungie.net post says about the HELM

&gt; The Hub for Emergency Logistics and Maneuvers, or H.E.L.M., is the new base for all current Vanguard operations within the system. From the H.E.L.M. players can interact with the War Table Seasonal vendor, access the Prismatic Recaster, decode Umbral Engrams at the Umbral Decoder, manage their vault, and retrieve items from the Postmaster.

So know a few things here and from the trailer

- The HELM is in fact in the last city, as seen at [0.51 in the trailer](https://youtu.be/_XlFBp_ZmyE)

- The HELM will have a vault AND postmaster 

- Not confirmed but this could be ""New location"" that crow will be at since he can be seen at the end of the trailer with zavala, it would also make sense thats why they didn't specify that it was the current tower

So

I have come to the conclusion that the HELM is in the last city and is a separate location from the current tower because of the vault and post.

Now stick with me, if this is a separate location AND in the last city. Could this location take place in the old tower. I very well know the new tower isn't going anywhere, it can be seen in the trailer and promotional art. However it may be possible that the HELM is a small section of the old tower and next season the old tower gets fleshed out, very much like the cosmodrome this season and next season.

What do guys think?"
0,"The screeb in the trailer has been known about for quite some time. More specifically, 2 months.","https://youtu.be/zYzz6oCjcvE as we can see in the video by JB3 posted 2 months ago, it is a singular screeb that is not hostile. It's environment models that of what we see in the trailer, however it is rotated in the trailer (makes sense, 2 months so marketing team probably didn't want to reveal what was around it that's a dead giveaway) 
So now you might be wondering, what's the dead giveaway? The pipes. As we can see, there are pipes all along the walls, further confirming that there is indeed scorn aboard a Cabal ship.

0,The H.E.LM is not the same location as the cube map . (At least not that version of the tower),"Some people are trying to make the connection of the [HELM](https://imgur.com/a/9pGcbqz) being located in a ""new tower"" due to the window having the same geometry as the one in this [cube map](https://i.imgur.com/K7PK8wC.png). This in not the case as other screenshot of the helm with a [different angle](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148611/S13_DPS-Banners_HELM.jpg?cv=3983621215&amp;av=3245488895) show a big structure at the same height as the windows. This structure seems to contain stairs in the outside and a ship in the inside making it seem like it could be located closer to the hanger in the current wall. While in the cube map there is nothing at the same height as the windows other than the white pillars.

There is somethings that leaves me wonder as to where exactly the HELM is, as it is shown to be [elevated and able to overlook a location](https://imgur.com/a/qkwk5o9) that I can't make up. This means that is has to be in a high place while still having other tall structures that resemble the wall around it? 

The only thing that I can think of is that maybe they repurpose some of the assets from the cube map that we saw into the current tower or a new social hub (second one is unlikely) as the cube map is known to be quite old (even before shadowkeep). Stuff is always changing while deployment and old concept get reused while others never see the light of day."

Apologies if someone's already spotted this!"
0,I think we'll have a scorn dungeon,"[https://imgur.com/a/ajl6560](https://imgur.com/a/ajl6560) that's where the scorn comes from. The dungeon part comes from the floating freighter and a strange looking armor set which people are claiming is Tex Mechanica (which is consistent with the way that dungeon unique armor has been before). The fact is that we have had a fairly consistent pattern of a dungeon every couple seasons, and the timeline adds up. So, I'm calling a scorn infested cabal freighter on the edge of the system."
0,there is most likely a dungeon coming- the evidence (possibly I don’t know for sure),"this armour was leaked not too long ago, and even though the armour is hakke and this season is cabal, the season of arrivals’ dungeon was daito armour even know the season was darkness based
(armour link is at bottom of post)

A large, random month space in the roadmap, this could be an exotic quest but it usually states that in the roadmap.. maybe it’s the dungeon keeping us busy

strange abstract scenery at the end of the trailer, almost like in the prophecy dungeon (which was nine based)

3 exotic weapons per season, each have catalysts, some are just randomly completed while others have specific tasks (shoot eyes of savathun with ruinous effigy in the prophecy dungeon) usually unique spaces aren’t shown for that long if they weren’t significant (though this might just be a teaser for next season)

that’s all my evidence

Anyway haven't see any speculation on this yet so thought I'd get the ball rolling."

#*Gameplay-wise*

**What makes it seem like it could be the New (old) Tower?**

[In the image on the Bungie website](https://i.imgur.com/nVLnOt2.png), we can see the H.E.L.M. is on the outskirts of the Last City and it is pretty high up. The craters outside the window also show that it is on the same side of the Last City as the New (old) Tower and the current Tower. The window also lines up well with [the cubemaps that were leaked a few weeks ago](http://montaguem.com/cubemaps?cubemap=environments_57?ver=v2922). It definitely looks like this area has been in development for a while, and while it could have been scrapped content before, it could be brought back into the development pipeline for future.

**Why would Bungie put in the resources to retrofit the Old Tower and bring it back?**

If Bungie wants to go with the Seasonal model, they need to keep the player base happy. A lot of people are nostalgic and have voiced their wants for the Old Tower returning. It would generate a lot of hype in the community, and to Bungie, hype is money.

**It's such a large area, they should put those resources into gameplay. Besides, we still see the current Tower in the Season 13 trailer!**

Well, maybe. Bringing back the Old Tower would take a lot of development time, but it doesn't have to be immediate, it could be baby steps. This season, it's the H.E.L.M., next season it's an armor and blacksmith, the season after it's a hanger, etc. Those baby steps eventually culminate into a full-fledged move from the current tower to the New (old) Tower. This would also be why we still see and will use the current Tower in Season 13 and for the forseeable future for most things, and why we still see cranes around the Old (new) Tower in the trailer.

**Why would we need a New (old) Tower, anyways? There's still more room in the current tower for vendors!**

Because we don't need more room for vendors. We need more room for armies.

---
#*Story-wise*

**Okay, now you're talking out of your ass. What do you mean ""armies""?**

Currently, in the story, we're facing the Darkness coming to destroy the Traveler and we have approximately seven seasons left until the Lightfall. A few seasons ago, we saw the introduction of Mithrax, the leader of the House of Light, and we helped each other assault those loyal to Eramis during the Zero Hour mission. In Season 12, we helped Variks evacuate the fallen in the House of Salvation from the ruins of Riis Reborn, and those Fallen promptly went to join Mithrax in the House of Light on Earth. In the Lore, they never hated us because we were human, they hated us because the ""Great Machine"" (the Traveler) was on our side, not theirs. Eventually, the House of Light was formed because those in it realized this and began to help us and work with us so that they could hopefully fight under the Traveler again.

In Season 13, we see the Caiatl, the current leader of the Cabal. In the trailer, she offers an alliance with Zavala, and Zavala wants the alliance too, or at minimum a truce. Otherwise, why would he bother talking to her? Of course, however, in asking Zavala to bow to her, she doesn't want an alliance, she wants another army at her command. Zavala says no, and that's that. During Season 13, we fight her forces and by the end of it, we prove ourselves as equals to the Cabal, at which point, Caiatl and Zavala agree on an alliance as equals. Enemy Cabal would still be in the game, and they would likely just be those who split from Caiatl and refused to ally with us, ensuring that we aren't losing an enemy type. This would be similar to how the Fallen are effectively split, with House of Light wanting to help us and work with us and other Houses like House Salvation under Eramis who still want to defeat us.

**Why would we want to ally with other races? They've been trying to kill us!**

Because we know the Darkness is coming, and we know we can't stop it alone. The Fallen have already tried, and the Traveler gave up on them. If we are alone, it's entirely possible that we end up like the Fallen, where the Traveler leaves us and we go to another system and fight a new race, where _they_ now have the power of the Traveler, and we just want it back. If we unite, we would likely unite in a new base built for all the different Xeno races, and it would be a common place where all alien forces can come together to plan things. It'd effectively be like a NATO base, but in Destiny, where everyone can come to help the fight in their common enemy: the Darkness. The title of Guardian would no longer just be human Guardians, but rather anyone/anything that fights under the Traveler. The Tower would become a common meeting ground for the Guardians to unite, no matter the race.

---

#*What about the Future?*

**Okay, so let's say we ally with the Fallen and Cabal. What about the Vex and Hive?**

The Hive? Good luck with that.

The Vex? In Destiny 1, the Vex worshipped the Black Heart, which would take control of the Vex in order to fight us. Ikora Rey later hypothesized that the Black Heart was an aspect of Darkness. If this is true, would it be possible to install an aspect of Light from the Traveler into the Black Garden? If we can do something like that, is it possible that the Vex would now fight along side us? In order to keep some Vex as enemies, similar to the Cabal and Fallen, we might have some Vex that are strong enough to resist the Aspect of Light and still do their own bidding.

**What would this mean going into Lightfall?**

Well, with Lightfall being a pretty ominous title, I see it panning out in a couple different ways (assuming the above is true):

* Lightfall will be about the _immediate danger_ that the Darkness presents to the Traveler. We are now fighting the Darkness on the ground, together with our allied forces. It will be all the Guardians (i.e. all humans and aliens fighting under the Light) fighting against anyone under the influence of the Darkness.

* Lightfall is just as the name implies, the fall of the Light and the fall of the Traveler. In uniting all the races to fight against the Darkness, even without the power of the Light, fighting together is now our only chance of actually coming out on top against the Darkness.

I only started playing Destiny again with about a month left in Season of Arrivals, and while I've been super into Destiny since then, I am still not very well-versed with the lore. All of the above was written with my current understanding of the lore and where the lore is currently going, and some things could very well be straight-up wrong. Thoughts and criticisms would be super appreciated!

---

#*TLDR*
The H.E.L.M. will be a part of the new (old) Tower, similar to how the Annex is part of the current Tower. The old (new) Tower will not be fully introduced in Season 13, but rather will be slowly built leading up to the release of Witch Queen. We will ally with hostile alien races under the Light of the Traveler and work together to defeat the common enemy we all share: the Darkness."

0,Possible screenshots of some new Stasis Aspect stuff from the trailer today.,"Around 2:00 in the new Season of the Chosen trailer, the video flashes through a bunch of different shots. Two in particular look a lot like new aspects for the Titan and the Warlock.

 [Both shots on this link](https://imgur.com/a/QxI8mCU)

Warlock: Seems to be a grenade charge aspect that you throw, it looks kind of like HHSN from what I can see.

Titan: The titan leaps in the air with an explosion in front of some stasis crystals. Looks to me like some kind of slam ability or movement ability."
0,How to super jump with game physics,"I was looking around reddit and didn't see anything actually showing people how to do this. I feel like it's got to be common knowledge (I've been doing it since the beginning of the game) but incase you didn't know, you can use angles in the game to launch yourself with your jump.

You just have to land on a slope (or stairs) and jump at the same time. This works best with a warlock using burst glide as you can increase the speed further with your glide. It works on all classes though.

Below is a video of me doing this in the best place I know of to give a good example.

0,The Screeb in the new Trailer is a Normal Screeb,"So I’ve been seeing a lot of discussion about the screeb in the trailer, some saying its Calus, others saying that it’s a jacked-up screeb.


It’s none of those things.


I made a side by side comparison of a normal screeb and the trailer screeb, with color coding for each lump, and they’re the exact same model. The angle and lighting in the trailer make this less obvious however.
[Here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/ofQDXaO)


This screeb was mostly likely inserted into the trailer to establish the Scorn as possible plot point in this season or seasons to come, nothing more, nothing less.


Edit: u/Cityofsaints shared [an image](https://imgur.com/7rgFJaZ) which is almost a 1:1 copy of the screeb from the trailer, take a look."
0,Calus May be the screeb in the end,"Is it that far fetched to believe that that thing is calus? We know that the abandoned ship is a cabal ship (I haven’t heard whether or not it’s the leviathan yet). Also osiris quoting xol could imply hive magic is in effect. Is it possible that something has deformed calus.

0,"A s13 dungeon would be sick, but I don't expect anything to actually come from the bit at the end of the trailer there.","In the Season of the Hunt trailer, we got a teaser of the Cabal meetup scene. Which wasn't expanded on until the week before the season after. I wonder if this is just a thing Bungie's doing now, putting a bit in each seasonal trailer teasing the season after the next.

I know Bungie sometimes likes to do surprise reveals, and I'm really hoping for a few, but I feel like some more realistic things to hope to get in s13 would be new PvP/gambit maps, a new Trials matchmaking system, Stasis tuning, strike-specific loot, etc."

The wording on the website also makes it seem like a new social space. What if The Helm is a new tower that we only get access to that portion during this season then at the end of this season or the start of the next the current D2 tower is removed and replaced with the Helm tower. This would explain why we still see the D1 tower in construction and why the Helm looks like it doesn't really fit in to the current tower. Thoughts?"

0,More info on the H.E.L.M and the Hammer of Proving from the player support page,"Taken from: https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/50004

**The H.E.L.M**
&gt;The Hub for Emergency Logistics and Maneuvers, or H.E.L.M., is the new base for all current Vanguard operations within the system. From the H.E.L.M. players can interact with the War Table Seasonal vendor, access the Prismatic Recaster, decode Umbral Engrams at the Umbral Decoder, manage their vault, and retrieve items from the Postmaster.

**Hammer of Proving**
&gt; To prove their strength in the eyes of the Cabal empress players will need to challenge Caiatl's warriors in the new Battlegrounds activities across the system. Use the Hammer of Proving to forge and socket Challenger Medallions out of pillaged Cabal Gold for the right to take on Caiatl's fiercest commanders in ritual combat. Visit the War Table at the H.E.L.M. to upgrade your Hammer of Proving through three tiers of pursuits that will unlock Hammer upgrades, new Proving Runes, gear drops, and more.

Basically, the hammer is just a new version of the Menagerie Chalice/Lure mechanic. It's still not entirely clear if the H.E.L.M is part of the current Tower or a separate location, but we now know some of its functionality."

Of course this is likely just a distress signal symbol considering the ship we see in the trailer is clearly half destroyed. But this could also be calling more cabal to sol (likely caitl)

Edit: u/WreckG pointed this out. You can see a glimpse of a Behemoth titan doing a double handed Striker slam rather than the usual single handed slam at [2:00](https://youtu.be/_XlFBp_ZmyE?t=120). Seems more likely to be Stasis Aspects.

Edit 2: u/AtheK10 pointed this out. You can again see a glimpse of what looks like a Shadebinder warlock doing something with their grenade at [2:01](https://youtu.be/_XlFBp_ZmyE?t=121) (you can see it better if you slow the video down). It looks to me like they're charging it."

There is also the end of the trailer with a darkened cabal ship and what seems to be a screeb aboard it. My best guess is the scorn coming back and dealing with their ""father"" the crow?

0,EoT RNG math help for the statistically challenged,"There seems to be some intelligent people here that understand statistic, so maybe someone can help me out.  Just for my own curiosity when my fireteam has someone getting bad RNG, I like to figure what the chances are of that happening. As with many others, we are having some bad RNG with EoT. Let's assume a 5% drop rate (not confirmed as far as I know), and I have 31 lootable clears.  I don't have the EoT yet. Chances of that happening are 0.95^31= 0.20, so like 20% chance of that happening, correct?  1 in five.  So actually its should be pretty likely that most raid groups of 6 who have run the raid 3x per week should still have someone looking for it.  

My group still has 3 out of the 6 people looking for it. WE actually had it drop for TWO people on our VERY FIRST CLEAR! After that, 1 more person, and a couple duplicate drops.  It ""feels"" like the RNG is broken (as it always does when you don't get the drops) but I don't know the match to calculate the chances of that actually happening. I'm sure it's not some unbelievably small number, we are just getting unlucky. Since it could be any 3 people out of the original group of 6, I just don't know how to make that math work correctly... And actually I would be more interested in figuring out the chances of 3 or MORE not getting it after X number of runs.  The chances that 3 people would all not get the drop after X number of runs is (.95^x)^3.  But that is a useless statistic, because I would have just cherry picked the 3 people who happened to no get it from a larger group. Since I am starting with a pool of 6, and 0-3 of those could get the drop and still meet the criteria, I don't know how to set up the problem... Been like 20 years since I took a statistics class."

At the back left corner of the campsite, we get to place 5 different things we retrieve from high-rank Eliknsi we kill on Europa: A piece of Praksis’ gear, Phylaks’ scarf, Eramis’ device to control stasis, Kridis’ tooth and Tanik’s head. However, one of them is missing. Between Kridis and Taniks’s pieces, there is a plat with nothing to be put in it. And which is the fallen that is not mentioned? Atraks. Something from Atraks is missing right there and we have no idea where or how to find that something to finish our collection of pieces of slained fallen. 

What do you think ir should be done to get this final piece? Is it in the encounter itself or anywhere in the raid? Is it non-related to the raid an it’s somewhere in places like Riis-reborn? Let me know what you think and we can crack out this missing piece together."

Each season is about 10 weeks, look at the seasonal weekly challenge is you wanna see that, and then multiply 120bd x 3vendors x 3chars x 10wks = 10,800 while making it 4 vendors would make it reach that 14, 400 we need.

0,Freezing Warmind Cells,"Warmind cells are back at it again, this time with a smaller insignificant thing that won't happen very often and is pointless to know.

Warmind Cells do not act like their own entity, well, sorta. While they can affected by the Hunter melee ability, Warlock melee ability, and duskfield grenades, ~~they do not give any benefits...at all.~~

[Example of Duskfield grenades freezing Warmind cells.](https://imgur.com/a/vwpcvmx)

Freezing them will not [increase or decrease duration](https://imgur.com/a/rZ8NDnL), still 20 seconds. [Comparison here](https://imgur.com/a/GdPNdWi)

Freezing them [will not stop them mid-air/stop them from coming back to you](https://imgur.com/a/Af1pMgZ) with Grasp.

Freezing them does [not affect Power of the Warmind](https://imgur.com/a/RxCRS1h), it does not give more damage or take away your bonus damage.

Freezing them does [not affect Protection of the Warmind](https://imgur.com/a/xZhsw3G), there was no different damage taken values. (Running 40 res)

Freezing them does [not allow them to act like a grenade or frozen enemy](https://imgur.com/a/fwPR599). In fact, you can not damage Warmind cells when slamming.

Freezing them does [not stop Cellular Suppression from occurring.](https://imgur.com/a/YVyFvwk)

[Dodging will not slow Warmind cells.](https://imgur.com/a/dEpl2Iv)

&amp;#x200B;

There is absolutely nothing to gain from freezing Warmind cells, just thought I wanted to share :)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Special Thanks to u/-Schrae- for asking for this, you can now crash your own game...sorta. With some Teletso shots and a warmind cell inside of a duskfield, the particles can cause enough fps dropage that it can crash your game.

Example A: [https://imgur.com/a/yF0bjzk](https://imgur.com/a/yF0bjzk) While the clip is extremely short, I only started recording when I was firing the Telesto shots, I hard crashed D2 right after the Warmind call explosion. I dropped from 147fps to 87fps and the game stopped. I have not been able to replicate this since, even after trying the same thing over and over again, very odd.

Also, Warmind cells can only be frozen by duskfield grenades after you pick them up and throw them. - [https://imgur.com/a/SNhtmjC](https://imgur.com/a/SNhtmjC)

Also, also, you can now cause an explosion when throwing a Warmind cell at a player next to dead enemies. - [https://imgur.com/a/aRf0L1s](https://imgur.com/a/aRf0L1s)

Edit 2: u/CharlieZard2001 Yes,  you get a damage buff from freezing Warmind cells if you are running the Fragment, Whisper of Hedrons. - [https://imgur.com/a/s1CPNFA](https://imgur.com/a/s1CPNFA)"

0,"Shaxx’s Atonement (Concept, Please Read)","(I want to start this off by saying sorry ahead of time. I know this isn’t technically the place to put this, however I want to reach as much of the community as I can, so I’m trying it here as well.)

Shaxx’s Atonement (Concept, Please Read)

To all my fellow creators and lore enthusiasts out there, I have a concept for a short animation that I’ve wanted to put together for a while now, and if anyone else is interested in helping, I genuinely think this is something that could be incredible.

So the idea: The story of this animation would basically be that the Last City/Tower is being attacked, everything is going south, much like what we heard The Bombardment was like. Now, as we’ve heard from Eris and the Drifter, Shaxx’s Ahamkara skull has already planted Savathûn’s song in his head. So in this animation, we’re running with the idea that Shaxx realizes this.

So it begins with Shaxx helping civilians and other guardians escape through the streets of the city, being chased by some unseen creature or entity.  They make their way to the tower, where he meets up with Ikora, Saladin, Osiris, Ana, and an Exo Rasputin. Ikora states how Zavala is nowhere to be found, nor is The Guardian. Shaxx tells them he’s brought the last of his civilians and lost whatever it was that was chasing them, and with this he turns and we see the first shot of the whole city. Pyramids are everywhere.

Saladin states they have to go, he knows when they can’t win, but Ikora says there’s no way they’ll escape with the civilians. All the while, Shaxx is abnormally quiet. The arguing swells until, Shaxx:

“Quiet. I’ll stay”

Everyone disagrees, saying he’ll die, and Shaxx says he knows. Saladin orders him to go with them, and Shaxx refuses. Saladin gets angry at Shaxx for disobeying him again, and asks him to listen just this once. But Shaxx turns and just says, “Please, Saladin. That witch’s hymn has been echoing in my head for some time now. Sometimes I can’t even think over it’s deafening tune. Please, let me atone”

In the end, they have no choice but to leave him, and Shaxx turns to face a rising tide of formless creatures. The helmet comes off, but we never see his face. The last thing we see is Shaxx, a brilliant ball of Arc energy, Thundercrashing against a tidal wave of pure Darkness.

The final shot is Mara, in some distant place, turn and look, almost as if she knows.

Anyways that’s the idea I’ve had, obviously I’d love to tweak it where it needs to be tweaked, especially the dialogue (I know, trust me).

So yea, again to any creators out there, musicians, animators, anyone interested really, I would love to bring this idea to life. If anyone is interested, feel free to message me on Discord. I’m going to try and put together a server to structure the work of this, assuming we get that many people interested anyways. I don’t know if anything like this has been done before, so apologies if it has. Either way, just let me know. 

Discord: Half Empty Bottle of Whiskey#1667

Honestly any help would be appreciated. I just want to show my love for the series, through the highs and lows.

Also any suggestions or thoughts for what should be done would be super appreciated as well, so just lmk down below"
0,"In regards to Crows ""dreams""","Screenshots from cutscene in question: [https://imgur.com/a/fin2UW6](https://imgur.com/a/fin2UW6)

Don't know if this actually means anything, but I haven't heard anyone else talking about it so I thought I'd bring it up. I was watching a lore video on the Hawkmoon, and the topic of Crow's dreams came up.  When it was brought up how he was in the form of a hawk in the dreams, it finally clicked in my brain why it sounded familiar. The cutscene from the original Red War campaign that played right after Ghaul captured the traveler. I know people have revisited the scene in the past after certain events came to pass, and it appears that one of Crows dreams line up almost exactly with the cutscene. Like I said, it might not be anything, but to me at least the comparisons were a little too close to be a coincidence."

0,Top Tree Dawnblade Heat Rising - Xbox One vs. Series X &amp; PC,"Didn't know this until just recently, but top tree Dawnblade's heat rising on Xbox One doesn't work the same as it does on Xbox Series X. On Series X, if you consume your grenade as you jump, you will float in the air until heat rising finishes (10 seconds). On Xbox One, it will only hold you in the air for about a second, and then you slowly descend. Furthermore, on Series X, if you super at the end of heat rising, you can stay in the air without descending until the super is finished. The way heat rising behaves on Series X is the same as how it works on PC. This is likely due to a frame rate issue. Other bugs like this have been seen as well in the past between console and PC. We only tested Xbox, but it may be similar on PS4 and PS5. \[Video here.\]([https://youtu.be/DYS663Ym9n0](https://youtu.be/DYS663Ym9n0))"

As I was timid, I basically stood on the plate for 2-4%, ran off to hide behind the boxes and came back after it was clear (I.E. nothing spawned, or I killed anything that spawned). I got to 100% and the fluid lowered, but the two Solar big shanks did not spawn, and neither did any Vandals. The only enemies that spawned were the small shieldless shanks and the exploding shanks.

0,Graviton Lance has Zen Moment,"After 2 years of sitting in my vault, I decided to whip out Graviton again, for old times sake. When I was using it, I noticed that it seem to got more stable while damaging enemies. Due to its maxed out stability, MnK players (AKA every youtuber) never even notice this. If you play on the sticks, it becomes quite noticeable. This weapon has barely been talked out and I feel has been slept on. Cosmology + Catalyst makes for some incredible crowd control capabilities, also to be utilized with Anti-Barrier rounds in Grandmasters, and along with that you have the second shot in the burst effected by Zen Moment that has NO damage falloff and high damage could make for one of the best utility weapons you could use. Its also cool to watch the chain reaction of cosmology kills in a hoard of ads whilst spawning absurd amounts  of Orbs of Power.

Graviton is underrated; has Zen Moment, very useful, and fun to use."

**Context:** We were proceeding with the Taniks boss fight like normal, were midway through the first damage phase and suddenly wiped. Luckily, one of our fireteam was able to record the wipe (see video above).

* The cause of death for all of us was ""Shared Fate"", which normally occurs if you don't revive a downed teammate.
* We didn't notice during the encounter but, in the bottom-right, the ""Light fading in x:xx"" timer was present, warning us that we needed to ""REVIVE PLAYER"".
* No-one was downed. You can see all six of us on the radar in the top-left alive and well right up until the moment that we wiped from the ""Shared Fate"".

0,Possible function for Ascendant lens.,"With be new twab this week it was said that the prismatic remaster was returning permanently. In addition to this bungie announced that a prismatic lens could be used to focus loot on what a player wants.
My theory is that:

The ascendant lens will be used in conjunction with the recaster to focus into some new dreaming city themed gear.

The seasonal content hasn't been revealed yet, and I think it could involve dreaming city. This leads me to my next theory being:

The ascendant lens will be used to locate the oracles within the last wish raid.

Oracles were heard/seen in the last wish raid at the start of season of the hunt. And could be used to locate and shoot to activate a quest. Similar to the template encounter. (Maybe exotic quest) but most likely not. Maybe even wish 15.

* Pretty much the entire platform can be stood on so there's more than enough space if you needed to duck back for cover, but if you go to the far back edge then it will cause ""Joining Allies"" to appear.

* About 70-80% of the arena can be seen from the platform (the best view is obtained from walking along the front edge as far back from the centre of the arena as possible without triggering ""Joining Allies"")"

0,Garden glitch or cheating...?,"So yesterday I played a round of Garden and we decided to do the challenge. Well one guy we were with asked to do the left side motes by himself.

I was defending left, and watched it all unfold three times (we missed our two phase).

We pulled the left portal, he went over alone....only once...came back...stood by the conflux for about 20 seconds...and pushed in all 30 motes.

0,New joining allies on Crypt Security?,"2 friends and I were trying to do the new 3 man on security without the OOB, and we somehow found a weird bug where the person down in the panel room got joining allies, and was pulled up top again with us. Immediately after 1st dps phase, the person on dark side had died and the light side player ran in to revive. After the doors closed the player down below for some reason got joining allies and was pulled back up top. For some reason though, reviving before the joining allies timer had finished counting down actually cancelled it. We haven’t been able to replicate this more then twice and it just stopped working randomly. Not sure if anyone else wants to give this a try and help figure out if it’s any specific requirements you need to fit, but it seems like it could be something if we can manage to make it more consistent. 

P.s. sorry if I’ve explained this badly at all but im as confused about it as you probably are reading it 😬"

0,So we got 2 seasonal exotic this season !,"Since the exotic quest tab on season of hunt doesn't show anymore triumphs related to any other exotic quests than harbinger I assume that we aren't gonna get a 3rd exotic for this season.   


Every other season from undying before season of the hunt had 3 seasonal exotics with 1 being a  season pass exclusive exotic and the other 2 being free to all players be it a random drop or quest exotic  ( Except season of Dawn for some reason )  


Season of Undying :  

1. **Eriana's Vow** ( Free to all Players )
2. **Monte Carlo** ( Free to all Players )
3. **Leviathan's Breath** ( Season Pass Exclusive )  


Season of Dawn ( This one is different ) : 

1. **Symmetry** ( Free to all Players )
2. **Bastion** ( Season Pass Exclusive )
3. **Devil's Ruin** ( Season Pass Exclusive )

2. **Heir Apparent** ( Free to all Players )

1. **Duality** ( Free to all Players )
2. **Hawkmoon** ( Season Pass Exclusive )  


Now i don't know if we are getting another exotic or not ( most likely not ). But if we are to get another exotic it will most likely be a free to all player exotic. In any case I won't hold my breath."

To open the cage just look towards you left(while looking towards the feather)
You can see a switch interact and the cage will open

0,Possibly the COOLEST glitch in all of destiny!," [Destiny: Possibly my favourite barrier surf yet! (Barrier Surf Glitch) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xygv3i0PPP0&amp;lc=UgwGxOPZjcmHd4lK8yx4AaABAg) 

&amp;#x200B;

Its been a few months now since players have been messing around with the new barrier surf glitch and we've found some pretty cool stuff, but this surf is by far the BEST one discovered, by whom originally I'm not sure. this glitch starts in the winters run strike boss area where you hit a fairly difficult barrier surf to then launch into the sky then due to the fact that you aren't allowed to summon your sparrow in this specific load zone you must sword fly to the Ketch where you can walk.

Other than that, like always, stay curios guardians!"
0,Another skip for the first part of dsc,The new skip involves the airlock effect which is slow and sometimes annoying imo so I was fiddling around and I found out you can get the same effect from atop of the airlock and if you let your sparrow slide down you can have the effect indefinitely. It won't take that much practice and is fairly easy so you can guide your lfg through the glitch fast and easy. Try it out. If you can't do it I can post a video tomorrow.

It is to the left of the feather in the room.

0,Harbinger Mission Weird Area,"At this point I think most people know about the mission, but I think I found something interesting. So once you kill the 3 emissaries, you go into the final boss room for lake of shadow, and it says survive. You can see that when you enter the room that you aren't entering through the regular way from the strike but through another way. I saw that once you teleport into the black bubble, and if you are fast enough, you can actually go through the door that you come out through the strike into the final boss. It has one of those doors that are blocked with a taken orb and can be destroyed to get inside the room. Once your inside the room, their are enemies and a completely destroyed room with the tunnels, but I wasn't fast enough because it kicked me out and said joining allies. At the moment the triumph for all feathers in a week hasn't been achieved yet, and I feel like the room if you explore it, will have another feather maybe?"

0,Paracausal Feathers for Bird of Prey,"A lot of people seem confused on the feathers for the quest. In each of the antechambers where you go to fight on of the initial 3 taken bosses, I.E. the Witch, the Captain, and the Centurion. There are spots to grab the feathers.

Witch - Before entering the room to fight there is a lever on the wall that opens the gate to the cage and you can collect the feather.

Centurion - on the highest catwalk in the room where you fight the centurion after it flees

Captain - on the top level of the little resevoir room you have to climb to get to the captain

There are also two other spots in the Hollow on your way to the final encounter both in the area leading up to it. One should be in a well lit up area with a few taken enemies after you exit the small room with the acolytes in it into the big room with the chasm. The second one in that area should be to the right of the group of enemies you fight before reaching the shard. Hope this is somewhat helpful, I'll try to post screenshots of where to find them soon."

0,"The ""Hidden Village"" Out Of The Box In The Reservoir - Exploration","[https://youtu.be/tJUDyYx6HAc](https://youtu.be/tJUDyYx6HAc)

[For context](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/k7z095/something_new_in_the_edz_not_related_to_hawkmoon/) \- About a month ago, I made a post discussing this ""Hidden Village"" of sorts outside of the Reservoir. See the linked reddit post for relevant links and discussions.

* TL:DR - A seemingly obscure and random area far out of the box was changed significantly with the launch of Beyond Light. The area in question is where we now find this ""village"". Originally, it was just a [peculiar texture outside of the box](https://imgur.com/a/pdbprSx), but it is now an (although intangible) fairly textured set of aged and broken down buildings along with a pretty interesting bridge. Before the [Ship area in The Reservoir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUnqOpKQoeE) was accessible, there was a penalty box below that area.

This penalty box is now gone, with the ability to teleport outside the box going with it.

Still, I have no idea if this could have any ramifications for something in the future. This is such a seemingly random change to a very random area, but one that seems to be very intentional.

0,Acquiring the Augment Buff for a directly previous Week (Scanner Aguments),"Video:  
[https://youtu.be/10qZR4UtVdY](https://youtu.be/10qZR4UtVdY)

I would hope it is common knowledge that you can pick up the augment buff from Variks towards the end of the week and complete it the following week. This trick is picking it up and completing the previous week's agument.

What you Need:  
An Old instance (held from a previous week, so has to be done at reset), and a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to preform this trick, have your friend hold the old instance of the given eclipsed zone (most useful if you are attempting to get an extra in for either Eventide Ruins or Cadmus Ridge), while you sit in orbit. When reset hits, join on them and fast travel to Charons Crossing, purchase the item from Variks that allows you to pick up the buff, and then travel by sparrow back to your friend. Once you have the item from Variks, kill the Scanner Vandal, and you will be able to pick up the scanner from the previous week's eclipsed zone with the current week's item purchase from Variks.

Once you have the scanner buff, DO NOT DIE FOR ANY REASON, this will remove the buff from your character and force you to pick it up again, which could cause issues with your ability to complete augments.

&amp;#x200B;

Detailed Explanation on why this works (and why the completing the following week works as well):  
The Augment ""buff"" has 3 Stages to it. First is the Item you purchase from Variks, which gets consumed immediately. This can be purchased once per week per account, and is not affected by anything outside of itself. Second is the Signal Buff in your inventory, this lasts for 7 Days, and allows you to pick up the scanner buff in patrol from the slain scanner vandal, this buff does not do checks on the week it was acquired or when it was used, it only makes you eligible to pick up a scanner buff. Third is the ""\_\_\_\_ Sectors x3"" buff that you see on the right side of your screen, this is acquired by picking up the scanner in patrol, and only checks where it was picked up, so if you have an old instance of Eventide Ruins, it doesn't care if the ""current"" eclipsed zone is Asterion Abyss.  


Sorry I took so long to upload and post this, I was super lazy the past 2 weeks, thought it might help anyone who would be up at reset this week."

0,Out of bounds the crashed Morningstar while still in Orbit?,"Obligatory first time posting, etc. 

I don't know if this is anything new or if I've just missed it being posted, but I unexpectedly got into an out of bounds I've never seen before. I was attempting to get into Restricted like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf5Nb50Wezw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf5Nb50Wezw). I've never had an issue getting this to work until yesterday, when I was a bit slow and ended up attempting to slide into Clarity Control right as the Morningstar crashed. 

Instead of surviving the crash and the game now recognizing me as in Clarity Control like it should have per the above video, as soon as I slid I died of a misadventure. I expected to be respawned at Taniks with the rest of my team, but instead I was spawned in an area of Clarity Control I've never seen before. It looks like the crashed Morningstar, however it was still in Europa's orbit. I could walk around mostly freely out of bounds and when I fell down, I was nearly directly above the Winnower statue. I hit a couple of invisible boundaries down there and couldn't get into the room with the statue, but could walk around mostly freely atop near the Atraks encounter. 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to explore nearly as much as I wanted to because our team was on a pretty tight schedule, but I'm going to try to replicate this if I can whenever we raid next. In the meantime, has anyone else experienced this? 

I apologize, I'm not very knowledgable when it comes to streaming/video uploading and the such so the only recording I have is a very short stream found here - [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/873004625](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/873004625). (You can very well skip the last like five minutes because it's just me trying to get a screenshot and failing.) If this isn't acceptable I can look into figuring out how to save it and upload to youtube or something else, but I just wanted to post this before I forgot. 

If this isn't anything new I apologize! I've personally just never seen this before and I try to keep myself up to date with the out of bounds and such to mess with my teammates haha."
0,Secrets in the prophecy dungeon?,"Hello, I farmed this dungeon along with my friends for a long time.. but lately we found the emissary of the nine after the cube encounter. It was strange but we knew about that because of a reddit post in the past. (Reddit post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/h7swwj/emissary\_of\_the\_nine\_in\_2nd\_wasteland\_encounter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/h7swwj/emissary_of_the_nine_in_2nd_wasteland_encounter/))

Later we started to search hidden things in the dungeon and here is what we found:

\- Strange looking geometry figures on the wall like a ""map"" somehow ([https://imgur.com/a/QGaC09l](https://imgur.com/a/QGaC09l))  
And they are visible in a lot of location, which makes me wonder if that intentional design or not.

\- You can shoot the balls before and after the cube encounter. Which again makes me wonder if there is an way to unlock something if you shot different balls in a different way or something like that  


\- Also, At the first encounter we can see a progression of the balls, some have metal plates on them, some dosen't but you can see every ball from above if you go to the encounter. Can this lead to some sort of a puzzle and the map could be an hint to it? Btw, the ""map"" was found in the dark room right after you open 2nd door. Where you can find urn 3 for the triumph 

\- Why are the urns there if the triumph is not on anymore?

\- What are the glowy sprial above mars, io, titan and mercury before the cube? We can also see one in the nine's room along with the lights that we can spot in different locations in the darkness.

Idk why but there might be something hidden in there.. even if it is an old dungeon..  
If you have any answers please let me know and I just want you to know that I am not that old in the puzzles and stuff, just wondering if there could possible be something. Have a great day guys"

I couldn't find anything here about this yet so apologies if someone already did this and this is already known. I was able to breach the door in the secret hawkmoon fireplace area. It appears to only be a small hallway that leads to an invisible wall that would spit you out of a window by the start of the reservoir.

0,Weapon Spreadsheet Updated for S13,"Hello all remember me, and the spreadsheet that I made prior to Beyond Light? The spreadsheet that focused on getting your weapons prepped for the sunset upcoming?  


Well I am happy to report that I am continuing on updating the sheet, and make it viable for every season hence forth. Until, well some app comes along, and makes it obsolete.   


Link to the Sheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnSQjqBqEqBQY3R203V5Y5b0il4gSeOIiPlsJfEErGfztmx9BHxzBA9wPlFo8oFMHNOddqrjpmx-hZ/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnSQjqBqEqBQY3R203V5Y5b0il4gSeOIiPlsJfEErGfztmx9BHxzBA9wPlFo8oFMHNOddqrjpmx-hZ/pubhtml) 

&amp;#x200B;

Small tweaks to it:  
\-- I have added all the Beyond Light expansion, DSC Raid, and Season of the Hunt weapons to the sheet so they can be hunted respectively to prep your vaults.  
\-- Added all the new exotics, associated quest, and catalyst if applicable that was added in Beyond Light/Season of the Hunt.  
\--Added a new sheet that will be updated towards the end of the season of weapons that will no longer be end game viable so its easier to prune them vaults.  


Per some questions that will be asked:  


\-- Hawkmoon does not have recommended perks since it would make the page longer than need be. Personally, I would recommend maximizing its handling, and using a perk for range/stability. I am going for Small Bore, Alloy Mag(Default), Surplus, and Heavy Grip.  
\-- Nothing really changed information wise. I kinda like the current state, and only really need to add/remove weapons when applicable.  
\-- Still no numbers cause I like science, experimentation, and encourage all to do the same.  
\-- I will update the sheet closer to the end of every season when prep begins for most of the community, or when I feel like getting around to it.  
\-- Feel free to continue to provide feedback, and if there are any weapons I missed be sure to let me know. As well as share it willingly with the creditation applied!  


Thank you for checking it out prior to Beyond Light it meant alot to me! &lt;3"

I was wandering oob in the resevoir area to see if I could figure out how to get past the barriers without communing with the light. I followed the path with the ""doorway"" we don't have access to yet and found a giant room with what looks to be generators. I kept going along the opposite side and there was an indicator on the mini map that there were enemies spawned ahead so I followed it and found 1 solo taken goblin just chilling on the edge of a solid area. I approached it and it attacked me so I killed it. Nothing seemed to happen and it wasn't like the placeholder Atraks that took minimal damage without showing numbers. It died just like normal. I killed it with Hawkmoon just in case as well.

0,Tire Game Perfect Score w/ Salvation's Grip,"Someone had previously posted something similar on this, but I can't find the post. I tried multiple searches. That person showed a video using Salvation's Grip to get a perfect score on the tire game on the moon. However, he said he could not replicate it, and others could not either. Well I did it! I saw someone playing the tire game, and went over and shot my salvation's grip on his game. Even though he wasn't getting the tires in the middle, I noticed at the end that it said near perfect score. So I thought I'd play myself and try a few things to see if I could do what I saw in the previous video. It was not tied to a specific game instance because I did go to orbit, and come back.

&amp;nbsp;

My strategy was to push the tires off in front, the direction they should be going. As soon as I pushed them, I would shoot the salvation's grip shot. Do it after every tire. You need to be able to reload and spam the shot to be able to do this. Hit the middle each time, and at the end it should tell you that you got the perfect score. It took me a few tries to get this. Sometimes it would only say I got a near perfect score (timing must have been slightly off). You'll see in my video that the tires actually go in to the craters that are not in the center, but it still gives a perfect score.

Edit: [where the first inside should be](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779264549919391757/798987567185264670/image0.png)

0,Random Vex Portal/Cannon near the Chamber of Water on Nessus,"I've been doing some exploring, both in bounds and out of bounds in the area of Watcher's Grave and the Chamber of Water. I believe, based on other users' posts, that this could be the entrance for the upcoming return to the Vault of Glass.

&amp;#x200B;

While exploring OOB in the Chamber of Water, I found a random Vex portal or cannon hanging out above some far out platforms leading to what looks like the sun. Without zooming in, it looks as if there are some circular patterns around it that could be interpreted as a large vex gate. I was trying to think of any location that this could be of use, but couldn't come up with anything off the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Unrelated to the portal/cannon, there is also a rather large platform that you can reach outside of the Chamber of Water that you freely walk around on without any weird clipping or textures missing. It's very detailed, moreso than just some random ""filler"" background.

0,Crouch Jumping with Stasis,"Crouching in air is a real rarity in Destiny 2. For whatever reason, Bungie has decided that Guardians can't lift up their legs in the air. Instead, we have to rely on abilities, mostly Code of the Missile, to sneak into tight places in the air.

However, recently Bungie made a mistake. They patched the base form of the Salvation's Grip Breach, and in doing so, they locked our crouch/uncrouch state while inside an ice shard. I don't think it's currently well known that this gives us our first true crouch jump in Destiny 2.

How useful is this?

There are many cases where there are small areas you'd want to get into, but can't because you'd need to crouch. Most of the time, you can just place your own ice shard and crouch on that. However, that isn't always possible. Perhaps there isn't space for ice below the hole you want to jump in, or ice can't stick around precisely at the right height. You can just cover the spot with ice, and then crouch jump into it. I foresee it potentially being useful for a small vent, like something a lost sector return path might use. Certainly a very niche tool.

See a toy example here: [https://youtu.be/0wUsEQk5J2M](https://youtu.be/0wUsEQk5J2M)

Maybe we need to find laptops instead of switches? or both? I don't remember this here before. 

Could be wrong tho."
0,What I've gathered pertaining to the reservoir/ hawkmoon area.,"Firstly, there are two doors in the area that contain enemies but are currently closed: one to the room in the left before the taken wizard, and one on the left near the bottom in the 3 story room before the bosses. These could be connected however it is uncurrently unclear to me if they are. Shooting them with hawkmoon yields no result.

Secondly, while the room kinda looks like the lake of shadows boss room at a first glance, it is not. from observation I can almost confirm that room is above us, and as I'm not good at breaching, the taken barrier to the left is currently unaccesible to me due again to my lack of ability to breach,  maybe tied to doors I spoke of earlier as it turns back towards that direction.

Third, behind the ship under the walk way there appears to be an odd silvery texture on the panels next to the stairs, again shooting with hawkmoon yielded no result.

Nothing odd about the ship. 

Nothing of note in the ""hallowed rift"" area, though it just seems like a zone change that will contain a taken portal at a later date.

It is of note in the boss room that the ""storm"" around the shard of the traveller is very well visible.

On to the recently discovered ""fireplace hallway"".

The closed doors in the surrounding area do nothing when shot with hawkmoon. There is a sort of lever to your left as you go in with a flashing blue light, and what appears to be an ""off"" green light above it.  From what I can see there is nothing else of valuable note here besides for the laptop at the very end.

On to the hallowed grove:nothing strange noted.

This is by no means meant to be a list of everything on the areas pertaining to hawkmoon, but some observations I've made on the trips into these areas. If you would like to add anything feel free."

0,There's something hidden in the Coup De Grace mission...,"While redoing the mission today, right before the final confrontation with the High Celebrant, i noticed there are barely visible platforms leading away from the final arena out in the Darkness.

I tried following them and to my surprise, they had a timer on them that covered them in the same dark damaging liquid that you see in a lot of other Dreaming City content, quite likely in order to make it easier to make a mistake and get sent back to the start of the now revealed jump puzzle.

After about 3 platforms, a new objective marker will appear. However, in my hurry due to the damaging platforms and in a panic due to the ABYSMAL vision during the puzzle, i messed up and ended up starting the last phase of the High Celebrant fight and had to watch as the objective marker, clearly pointing elsewhere, faded.

I ended up completing the mission and am now locked out from trying again for the week. Can anyone else try and confirm/finish what i started? I haven't found anything about this yet. Forgive my lack of evidence, i'm not yet in the habit of taking screenshots.

EDIT: Possibly a previous Ascendant Challenge as the area is apparently Re-Used. In which case, damnit."

With the recent finding of Crota ''eating'' stasis,it can be theoried that he will return later this year. Why? Each season needs an aspirational activity - this season had the raid,next season will have trials,season after will have VoG,leaving a dungeon for the season before Witch Queen.

I talked about it on my Youtube channel, looked through +10 gameplays going through the same room and only found another one passing by the shadow (it's the video from Esoterikk showing the penguin locations), and recently, one of my subscribers sent me a clip recorded with his phone, showing a better look at the monster/ shadow: [https://twitter.com/TheWildGamer95/status/1347880550787395584](https://twitter.com/TheWildGamer95/status/1347880550787395584)  


It looks like 2 shadows, one of which seems to ""attack"" the other one, and ""ride"" it. Or something similar. We can speculate what they could be doing but in my personal opinion, they doesn't seem to be anything we've seen. Let me know your what you think!

I also have another mini theory that Erasmis isn’t dead she’s just stuck in Ice (stasis) I believe she could come back in the future and also bring back atraks with her maybe by going into the deep stone crypt and putting his conscience into another exo suit maybe different or the same as the one he had in the raid, anyway feel free to speculate and theorise just thought I’d say what I think"

The higher this equation equivalents to the more quality content we get. But with all this information there is a flaw. With the number for F2P rising the more EV purchased the more likely they are to buy dlcs and before part of PB. This makes the charts something like this 📈📈📉📉📈📈📉📈📈📉📉📉(F2P) in ￼￼￼￼ order to get the most content out of bungie we need more PB this is where hardcore players come in ( HC) the longer we have to wait for more good content the more HC we lose without HC EV will ruin the game.

Mechanics: im started finding a way to deposit 2 nukes as a solo player, 9/10 mobility with movement exotic is required, i dont use scanner, but im certain there is a way to circumvent this by using the oob.

i start with suppressor, whatever side the operator is on/goes to is the side i will finish suppressing on, as the timings are not possible without finishing besides it. i deposit buff after i finish, and grab operator quickly, a late pickup will cause the operator to get deactivated before you pick it up. if done correctly you will have about 3 seconds to get positioned to grab nukes before all 3 spawn. i then shoot one of the FAR panels (in hope to make the nukes spawn in both catwalks, i grab the closest nuke on my side, and take a chance at the close deposit on the current side. if correct, i grab the second nuke and oob with it, making the phases a little bit longer, but also activating the scanner glitch where an extra spot can be deposited in, while i have only gotten to the second phase. i have not been able to verify if you can do the glitch twice to make it 100% chance at every dunk spot, once i finish a normal round without oob, i oob with operator, as it will always be deactivated (suppressor is in terminal, scan is still on vandal) once im back up, i rinse and repeat, grab sup from terminal, start on opposite side of operator vandal, stun, and dunk. this is just a theory, most of the mechanics can be done with skill, while the nuke spawn locations are RNG based, making the solo statistically improbable."

Also hopefully dispelling a few theories going around. (All streamable links were done in one run. Just had to split it up due to the websites 500MB limit)

https://streamable.com/un93or

This first bit is where I see the most hang-ups. The key point here is that you should **NOT** shoot him when he teleports beneath that rock archway. The same location as the Portal. After he has disappeared, you're free to shoot the portal. You don't have to wait for the mission objective to change nor do you need that ""burst damage"" or w.e people were saying with Shotguns. Aside from that, as long as you don't kill him, you can damage him as much as you want.

https://streamable.com/shswwf

Same point here tbh. Just do **NOT** shoot him when he teleports away, again, same place as where the portal spawns. After he disappears, shoot away. No need to wait for mission objective to change.

https://streamable.com/l2x1et

Idk if people get locked out here, tbh. Haven't seen it happen. Just thought I'd put this in as well just so people can watch it. I bursted him down super quickly and it was fine. Idk what happens if you kill him before he goes down on that knee though.

https://imgur.com/jTLnnuP

Did this around 8-10 times to get the ship and never bugged out. From what I've noticed, it just seems like you shouldn't hurt him as he's spawning the portal. That simple.

Hope I could help someone. Good Luck!"

Now everything visible on the warden title is obtainable, but there still isn’t enough to unlock the title. At this point there has to be a third secret exotic weapon because it would probably finish the warden title. 

Since beyond light was delayed festival of the lost was is season of arrivals and we got the ascendant lens then from spider for no reason(at the time). If the festival of the lost was in season of the hunt then it would make sense. 

So I’m definitely not the first to say this but the ascendant lens probably is involved in finding the secret exotic. I’ve seen people oob into a platform in the EDZ that looks like it is in the queens court or something. And the logs Osiris leaves to Zavala in his office are interrupted by Mara Sov so maybe we will see her soon(maybe even with the Crow).

For me and some others, it is impossible to progress the mission once you place the lure, and the boss teleports for the 4th time, he just stands there, and no adds spawn to give the buff which makes killing him take ages. Once he finally does go down, nothing happens, and you still have the 'Engage the High Celebrant' objective. Bungie so far has not acknowledged this"

0,Various ways to do DSC Security encounter - best method?,"So far I've come across 3 different ways to run the security encounter and I was wondering what people thought were the best methods?

1. The very first time I did the raid, we did it the ""normal way"" where the operator goes down, scanner picks up buff on dark, calls out the terminals for the operator to shoot, passes the buff over to the light side and repeat, operator sends buff up and scanner buff sent down.

2. I then come across this other method while farming spoils, where someone glitches out of the map and you end up with the operator and scanner both downstairs together....

3. Yet a 3rd method was the scanner staying up stairs but moves between the dark and light rooms while the operator shoots the panel to open the doors for the scanner...

For 3, I wasn't sure exactly how this was done but I'm assuming that the operator stays upstairs until the scanner scans both dark and light sides, and then the operator proceeds to head downstairs, shoots the panels, buffs are swapped, etc

I think 2 and 3 seemed to be the more straightforward method but...I wasn't really sure how 3 was done...

Does the 1minute timer before the basement is set on fire not start until the operator actually goes down there? That's the only way I could think of for doing method 3..."
0,"Using Destiny Datasets (DestinySets), I think I'm able to see which exotic catalysts are placeholders, and which ones will appear in-game sooner rather than later.","I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole when looking at DestinySets while drinking a beer, as one does, and for whatever reason started to look at Exotic Catalysts in the database and noticed something strange.

When we look at the catalysts that we know are in the game because we can acquire them, the symbols representing the catalysts in the API look like the gun itself. These are the symbols that pop up when your masterwork objective is complete, or when they're in your Quests tab. 

**Examples below:**

**Trinity Ghoul**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3457865914](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3457865914)

**MIDA-Multi Tool**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3466057365](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3466057365)

**Whisper of the Worm**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732814938](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732814938)

**Crimson**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1783582993](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1783582993)

You can also see what I'm calling placeholder catalysts -- they aren't ""fake"" per se -- after all, they exist in the API. But the icon looks like a trace rifle (the same icon as Coldheart) and look nothing like the gun that the catalyst is referencing. 

My bet is not necessarily that these catalysts won't ever drop, but -- at the very least -- they're not going to drop any time soon, relative to the next batch of catalysts (coming soon!)

**Examples below of some of the weapons the community's been more vocal about catalysts for** (sorry, dudes)

**One-Thousand Voices**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:82994288](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:82994288)

**Le Monarque**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:466834938](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:466834938)

**Malfeasance**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1234111636](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1234111636)

**Arbalest**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1880379474](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1880379474)

**Queenbreaker**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1061006937](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1061006937)

**Anarchy**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1178660677](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1178660677)

There's a third class of exotic weapons --- those that have iconography that look like their respective weapons, but haven't shown up in the game yet.

**Here's a list (and links) to those weapons.** Some of these have been guessed based on a post (that I can't find right now) where icons of exotic weapons were revealed in some sort of image prior to the release of Beyond Light. 

**Heir Apparent**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1324556594](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1324556594)

**Devil's Ruin**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732252706](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732252706)

**Traveler's Chosen:** [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3967134106](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3967134106)

**Bastion**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:4273298922](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:4273298922)

Other oddities:

The catalyst for **Eyes of Tomorrow** has a icon of its own that appears to be classified: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2835258088](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2835258088)

**Deathbringer** is listed as ""No Name"", but has its own icon: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1298151900](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1298151900)

SHORT VERSION (tl;dr or whatever)

We may be seeing catalysts for **Heir Apparent, Devil's Ruin, Traveler's Chosen, Deathbringer &amp; Bastion** sooner than later. The rest of the exotic weapons that currently do not have catalysts are all treated equally within Bungie's API.

FWIW: As a trace rifle, it's hard to say if a **Wavesplitter** catalyst exists, or is simply a placeholder."

0,Iron Temple Reflections in the Chamber of Starlight have changed.,"Hey all,

My brother recently made a YouTube video regarding the reflections in the puddles in the Chamber of Starlight of the dreaming city. 

Here’s the link if you’d like to watch for yourself : https://youtu.be/m1PnnKMgics

For those that’d rather read, the puddles in the Chamber of Starlight have never reflected the surrounding areas of the Lost Sector. They have always been essentially Windows to other areas of the world. Prior to Beyond Light, a particular puddle showed the Iron Temple, which is odd because clearly the temple doesn’t reside on the Dreaming City, nor is it even in D2. Could this possible be pertaining to the Ascendant Lens? Furthermore, why has the reflection changed? 

Would love to know your thoughts and see if anyone could look into this. I highly recommend watching the video for a more thorough explanation."
0,The dreaming city lens from the last event,So i don’t usually post on here but i think we should really look at this lens from the last Halloween event. I think everyone looked on the dreaming city and i think that was too easy and not the right place to look. There already are so many of them in the dreaming city and making this one portable seems to be on purpose. Maybe I’m just crazy but it could be on other planets and we just haven’t looked but who knows. (Praying it’s not time gated)

Unfortunately I run out of time and I couldn’t take a picture or explore more. 

If someone is willing to investigate maybe we are into something. It reminded me of Niobe Labs and the weapons.

0,Theorie | Destinys Future: Season 12 + upcoming year,"So guys it got a Theorie down here which will could be pretty interesting.

little disclaimer: i know some things could just be foil hat thinking but... who knows. I had i just fun thinking  what could come next.

(I will separate it in different parts)

1. Things happening now: You are all aware of the awful dawning event present. It was trash but we didnt get an exotic weapon. For me that means that there is still a new secret exotic or something coming in the Future. 
Additionally there is this thing with secrets on europa couldnt that be Linked to that. I know there is mich spinfoiling but what if there will be something. I mean there is so much on Europa. I just mean Clovis Bray, the Stranger, darkness, eclipsed zones, lore secret things. There would be such a great potential to make something like a secret as a developer. The last time we got a weekly Rotation of the overworld After the raid was completed with a cutscene there were many things left. I know its not forsaken but there still many things left and because of the Community bungie is less teasing the content because of some events in the past (corridors of time... with a crazy unknown reward! -.-).

2. Future story of destiny:
Disclaimer everything what is know coming is just some thoughts i had because i thought... mhh yeah... that would make sense you know?

Ok, lets Start. 

You should know that we are fighting xivu arath this season (her i forget the name thing which Killed sagira) and we know we are getting Savathun next year AND ON TOP OF THAT we know that the dreaming city will come to an end in this year (Multiple reasons: like uldren, mara, upcoming seasons, maybe sunset in a year).
We are getting a 100% a raid with witch queen and we know we released riven who granted a last wish to the queen (savathun). This would fit pretty good.
But who is the queen and how are we going to meet her?. THATS THE POINT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE WONT FIGHT SAVATHUN IN WITCH QUEEN. I mean could be really possible that we will fight her, the title already says. But if you would Think a little bit more you would notice there is more. Savathun tried to Interefere and wanted to stop us talking with the darkness in Season of Arrival. Savathun has her power from the darkness too so maybe the darkness slapped her ass for doing that(correct me if i am wir but a friend of mine talked of something like this but i cant remember if it was his thoughts or the grimoire he bought). So Savathun could come to our side and fulfill her Bigger plans (and teach us hive magic as a darkness subclass as well).
Another point why i think that savathun will least not be the raid or story Boss of the witch queen campaign is Xivu Arath. He is also a Hive God. I dont think that we just going to Kill him in a 8min season mission in some months so there has to be a raid with him. This whole year (seasons) could be the introduction of Xivu Arath as a whole and we learn more about savathun. But the point is... the two siblings wont get together in witch queen. Its known that the whole Osmium Trio of Oryx, Savthun and Xivu Arath arent so good friends(additionally they are going conpletely different paths). If Xivu and Sava dont come together on the same boot or somewho habe similar plans, they wont be friends either in witch queen. Therefore i think they wont do a raid WITH 2 HIVE GODS in it and also not a simple season mission to Kill Xivu Arath a HIVE GOD.

I could also come completely different that savathun is still our enemy and Xivu arath will Follow us until light fall. But i dont Think that. I think she will use us to get rid of her Sibling and fulfill her bigger plans with the Power the medley we heard a whole year...



Pls dont be too mean These are just some funny thoughts i had but i thought i must them."
0,Create warmind cells with witherhoard (and maybe anarchy),"I was running the decent encounter with witherhoard and the ikelos smg on a warmind cell build and I noticed that witherhoard would create warmind cells. Doing some testing, it appears that if witherhoards damage area kills an enemy while you are holding an ikelos or seraph weapon, the witherhoard kill counts as a warmind cell generating kill.

I have not tested this with anarchy yet, or other weapons that have dayed kills to get to the source of the glitch, but all I do know so far is that the damage area on the ground can create warmind cells if you are holding an ikelos/seraph weapon.

If anyone tests this further put your results in the replies and I will eventually add more details to this post. 

Tldr: shoot a shot from witherhoard and immediately swap to a seraph/ikelos weapon, kills from witherhoard count as seraph/ikelos weapon kills while you are holding the ikelos/seraph weapon."

once we got in we set our sights on the final goal of the traveler shard, we knew it was close by but the dark alliance area was surrounded by barriers. after a while I was just messing around when I [hit a push barrier and went really fast](https://youtu.be/OhfpAixB7R8), now at this point I thought it was some weird pull so I went back to try and hit it again before [realizing](https://youtu.be/1k_Rph-zjgY) that I was below the death barrier for the dark alliance area.

I tried again and [found the shard just vibin up there](https://youtu.be/qzJ1m64pOqs).

Because i'm an absolute idiot I forgot to shadow play it but once your on the stick you can thundercrash to a [higher spot](https://youtu.be/vwQ5ccpYEl0). once your up here there's a couple other areas you can stand on as well. biggest thing to note is that there a a bunch of decent crouch spots here that may be useful.

I was about to hop off aswell so as a last ditch effort I tried the res glitch solo. The thing about doing it solo is that its MUCH MUCH harder than with a friend as you have to hope you actually get respawned in the place you want AND you basically have to get it first try or bang your head against the wall for 3 more hours. I guess that today was my luckiest day of 2021 because I hit it [solo](https://youtu.be/Y5QR5m5Ha8M).

From here if you go [high up](https://youtu.be/E60MjSM1N6c) and to the left you can land on a new? piece of land and get pulled by something [very strange](https://youtu.be/YXiRbSWnjyk).

At this point one has to ask, ""why is any of this possible?"" well my idea is that the cave we saw at the very start of this OOB adventure was actually supposed to connect the two dark alliance areas together as it connects very neatly the two, there's [push back barriers](https://youtu.be/nqRYR7PiQwM) on both sides of the cave and a [hole](https://youtu.be/p9_bHeRhxvw) on top of it. To me its also the only reasonable explanation as why else would we be able to go to it and climb up if not that it was cut content.

big spinfoil for me here but I also believe that at some point the devs wanted to connect the Dark alliance area with the shard of the traveler. this is because the only way we can get to the shard is by following the weird hill path with again more pushback barriers on both sides very similar to the cave.

special shoutout and thanks to u/Froggy618157725 and u/CriesOfeternity for helping me out with the whole thing as it wouldn't be possible without them. if anyone wants to try and do this for themselves then here's the full [route](https://youtu.be/n3ikjDX0Q7g) minus getting on the stick and another [route](https://youtu.be/mICg3kTdNZc) going from the cave up to the dark alliance first area."

It talks about Hezen Vex coming from Venus. Thought it might be new/related to other Easter eggs popping up about Venus (e.g., Moon lost sectors) and the fact that VoG is coming back. 

[Here](https://youtu.be/vaPM0ODhlw8) is a link to the video. Ghost says, “Hezen Protective. But I thought they were only deployed on Venus. Does this mean different Vex units have started traveling through gates? That’s... not great.”"

0,"Strange humming, ice cracks, and growls on europa","DISCLAIMER: Not sure if this has been posted i tried to scour through and find a post but couldn’t find any so hopefully i didnt gloss over it.


I was patrolling Europa to get some screenshots and my last stop was the pyramid by the exo stranger. After sitting for awhile I noticed some humming so i turned off music and kept listening. After staying for awhile more types of sounds occured like ice cracking and some growling coming the big ravine.

I also went to other locations like cadmus ridge and eventide but there was not the same sounds. And if you walk back towards the stranger the sounds stop until you get to the ravine again

Could be nothing but ambience and ice is known to make weird noises when it cracks so maybe its some bungie audio magic. But the growls left me questioning if something is down there. Maybe it could be the same type of easter egg as titan with the giant hive worm swimming. 

Let me know what you think!

0,Getting to Rivens heart room in patrol,"With the recent discovery of being able to [get into the dark forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV6F1k2_h-c&amp;ab_channel=Eternity), Me, Eternity, and  [u/Froggy618157725](https://www.reddit.com/user/Froggy618157725/)  went and tried the same concept for rivens heart room (the place you get teleported to in queenswalk).  


I had varying levels of success being able to do it with

[30 frames](https://youtu.be/YTQd_iSgCtg)

[100 frames](https://youtu.be/5mVB0uxgo5g) (you dont need to pop super you can just jump up)

[dying by sparrow instead of grenade](https://youtu.be/K6RT96jPaO4)

and even [dying by sparrow and then changing my frames to 30 to get revived](https://youtu.be/YSxS9PWL2aA)

In all honesty I think the only thing that matters is staying in crouch only spots so that game is forced to spawn you uncrouched in a crouch only position. Framerate might have a chance to help/hinder you but its so RNG that its hard to tell. For me I got it 1/10 times I tried while  [u/Froggy618157725](https://www.reddit.com/user/Froggy618157725/) never got it once in the hour that we tried.

I also think how high your rez is can effect where you get spawned as [sometimes you just get spawned above](https://youtu.be/CVrconnlQQY) without having to do anything

this would be possible in the raid if there was a way to actually get up there without sparrow flying and as far as i'm aware is worlds first. again special shoutout to Eternity and  [u/Froggy618157725](https://www.reddit.com/user/Froggy618157725/) as it wouldn't be possible without them helping."

0,Extremely late theory I have for Wish 15,"Here’s this post from someone who has more information: https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/jyf9af/deep_stone_crypt_raid_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

So it turns out that this was sitting in my drafts for a few weeks and I hadn’t posted it, so that’s cool. Also, seeing how wordy I had written this I have put a 5 word summary at the very bottom of this post.

As many are aware the theories of how to find Wish 15 for the Last Wish raid have begun to uprise again (see the post above if you haven’t already). With this I’ve decided to try and jump back in and I think I’ve figured out a few things. These are things that I just thought of recently but I wouldn’t doubt that some other people have had these theories before, but in case not here’s what I came up with.

One of the things that I recently figured out is that we likely need to use the symbols to tell a story of the wish. In the lore for the Titan armor piece Helm of the Great Hunt, the lore has dialogue from Riven which says “What [the Queen] wants, the Techeun move worlds to obtain. And so the Witches devise an impossible machine that speaks a visual language with very few spaces between its words. This machine speaks [wishes]. Makes [bargains]”. The idea that the symbols are used as a visual language kind of reminded me of Native American totem poles. From what I remember, the totem poles carved by the Native Americans show carvings of several different animals in a way that tells a story. I would also like to say that the designs of the hawk symbols in the Last Wish raid do look relatively similar to Native American artworks of birds. Looking at most of the wishes that we currently have it’s hard to say how the symbol patterns tell a relating story, but at least one is pretty obvious to me. 

Wish number 9 is the wish that adds dialogue from Failsafe throughout the raid when you make the wish, the wish is a very simple input using only the six wish plates in the center of the Wall, the wish input involves a Bird2 symbol in the bottom right of the section of six and the other five involve a Fish2 symbol in each of them. From my own guess, the way the fish is seen on the symbol makes me think it’s a dead fish, which lead me to think that the fish symbols represent the 5 dead crew mates that were aboard the Exodus Black, and the one hawk symbol is meant to represent Failsafe(with the hawk having a stern and practically emotionless face which shows that Failsafe has suppressed her sorrow of her dead crew, this might be a stretch though). As for how to interpret the other wishes we have I’m not sure, but I think that this is something to go along. I would also like to say that the mission where you find Failsafe’s crew is called “O Captain”, and as we all know everything in the raid revolves around the phrase “O _______ mine”, so we may need to find a few other links.

If anyone else has other ideas or theories I would like to hear them in comments. And if anyone is going to try and look into the totem pole idea further, thank you and I wish you luck :). This entire thing has just bugged me for so long and I want to see it solved some day, so I’m hoping this might lead to something. Good luck everyone!

Summary: Wish wall is totem pole."
0,question : Secret Weapon / exotic and tough of the curent season,"Do you guys think there will be a secret weapon this season or not ?  
Also what are your tough on the current season ? good / bad / not noticable / etc etc  


For me i feel like there might be a secret this season but i don't think it will appears before the last hunt  


and this season feels kinda underwelming in the sense that the activity is cool but not really big, its just glorified lost sector and there is only 4 right now  (i wish there was more diversity) ... the hawkmoon well its like the 6 or 8 exotic handcanon, i feel like they just added it to the game so they could milk again eververse skin  
(just look at the ornement tab in exotic the handcanon one have 2 pages, while most of the other almost have a hard time to get to half a page)  
but at least i love the warlock ornament from season pass

0,"3-Man ""Solo Lost Sector Mastery"" Triumph","###Background

A couple of my friends were running the 1280 Lost Sector (Bunker E15) earlier on to farm Essense of Dawning. Right at the end, one of them had an internet connection issue and got booted to orbit. The other one opened the chest and received the triumph ""Solo Lost Sector Mastery"" (Complete any Europa Lost Sector on Master difficulty without a fireteam) plus an Exotic helmet.

---

###How to perform the glitch:

1. As a fireteam (2-3 people), enter the 1280 Lost Sector on Europa (today it is Bunker E15).
2. Complete the Lost Sector (i.e. reach and defeat the final boss). **Do not open the final chest!**
3. All but one player leaves the fireteam and returns to orbit, leaving one player remaining in the Lost Sector.
4. The remaining player opens the final chest.
 * If they have not yet obtained the ""Solo Lost Sector Mastery"" triumph, they should obtain this.
 * They should also have a chance to obtain whichever of the Exotics are available.

This can then be repeated as needed. :)

###Evidence

I hadn't obtained ""Solo Lost Sector Mastery"" yet, so they offered to show me the glitch and help me get the triumph: https://youtu.be/HSA1bRY7VXA

Special thanks to JJ and Mr Cube for finding/helping share this glitch! :D

NOTE: I posted this glitch earlier with emphasis on being able to use this to farm the [""(If Solo) Exotic Armour""](https://i.imgur.com/Ql1Nh0u.png), but a few people have said that it was easier to get the exotics just running it as a normal 3-man fireteam, so I've reposted with that part edited out. This method can definitely be used to obtain exotics that are listed as only being obtainable through Solo Lost Sector completions, though. :)"

They weren't sure if it was because of the connection issues or whether or not it would be possible to replicate by just completing the lost sector two-man, one leaving, and then the other opening the chest, so they tried it a few more times (this time with one leaving deliberately) and on the fourth try the remaining player received another exotic helmet.

0,Less confusing Of All Trades,"I’m sure most of us have seen some videos, read some strategies, and run this weeks DSC challenge. My clan and I had theorized the challenge weeks ago and came up with our game plan. I think it’s easier than everything else I’ve seen so far. The video is from a clanmate’s perspective. I’m not new to this community, but I did create a new account to rep my clan.

Key points:
Three teams of two.

One from each team always picks up the augment first and guides their team with the other being in the backup role for their team.

Move left to right across the room: operator -&gt; scanner -&gt; suppressor.

Backup roles deposit nukes, so make sure you have designated spots for them ahead of time. How you do that is up to you. We have operator on far left, backup operator left catwalk, backup scanner right catwalk, and backup suppressor far right. Operator always shoots the leftmost nuke.

With the method we used, no chart is needed, nobody needs to know what phase you’re on, it just moves along naturally.

We didn’t plan out swapping buffs, but I think it should be suppressor first to give them time to get in position. Then operator and finally scanner.

We play on Xbox and we did this challenge with a clan mate that this was his fourth clear of the raid. Our goal is to always try to find better ways to accomplish challenges in Destiny.

0,"""Chain Strategy"" for ""Of All Trades"" Deep Stone Crypt Challenge","I've run this with several teams now, some successful and some not so successful.  I've seen multiple different strategies proposed, but this is the one that has consistently lead to success with a minimum number of wipes.  I searched the sub for this to have been posted but didn't see it - apologies if this is a dupe.

Start by opening the roster view and checking the order.  Tell everyone to remember the \*\*name\*\* of the next person in order, with the person at the end remembering the first person's name.

Assign first round roles to everyone.  First person gets Suppressor, third person gets Operator, and fifth person gets Scanner.  Second, fourth, and six are first round add clears/bomb runners.

Once both bombs have been deposited, anyone with a buff is going to go to the station and call out the name of their buff and the person whose name was next in the roster.  That person is going to take that buff.

For example, let's assume your fireteam consists of:

1. Alice
2. Bob
3. Charlie
4. Dani
5. Elsie
6. Frank

Then you'd start by saying: ""Alice, you're calling out Bob.  Bob you're calling out Charlie.  Charlie, you're calling out Dani.  Dani, you're calling out Elsie.  Elsie, you're calling out Frank.  Frank, you're calling out Alice.""   (Confirm that everyone remembers the name they're calling.)

""Alice, you're first Suppressor.  Charlie, you're first Operator.  Elsie, you're first Scanner.""  (Confirm that everyone knows what buff they're picking up)

Remind everyone that they should not put buffs into the station until after both bombs have been dunked.

With this strategy, every player only needs to remember two things - what they are doing the first round (if anything) and whose name they are calling out when they drop buffs (if they have a buff at the end of any given round).  No numbers, no geometry, no teams, no JPEGs, etc."

TLDR; After finishing a phase, the timer goes away as if the phase completes but the plates don't let you read making you stuck in the encounter causing a guaranteed wipe, aka soft locking the encounter. This happens randomly, but very commonly.

But why does this happen remains. In Beyond Light Last Wish has seen many changes. A lot of these aren't even bugs, but intentional changes. One of these occurs in Vault where when you complete a lock (phase) during the encounter the cube in the middle spins. This seems to be the only intentional change to Vault and may be why the soft lock happens. However, I am not sure about this and it is only a theory.

This happens very commonly and makes Petra's Run significantly harder."

When you enter the boss room you can go into the right doorway. Then look to your left and jump up. There will be a hole in the wall. Run and jump into it. Then crouch through it. Go to the bottom and to the left. Crouch walk on the radiolaria under the wall. You will be in the floor. Walk a little forward and or to the right to move your gun model through the floor. Now you can kill wyverns, hydras, goblins, harpies, overload minotaurs etc by shooting any weapon through the floor. You can tell if it worked cause you will do damage. If not, move slightly in any direction until your gun shoots through the ground. Kill 90% of the enemies then push the main boss and kill anti-barrier hobgoblins and repeat."

0,Atraks - 1 you can get rid of purple stuff without using the airlocks,"This may be known already, apologies, and better explained too. 

While doing the challenge for atraks, we managed to get some of the purple things to disappear (and never come back) rather consistently with the following method:

Once we had 3 people carrying the purple things (we tried with 2, but success rate was lower) , we would make sure operator would shoot them so they drop all in the a very small area (we shot them all standing against the wall of the big pillar, left of the lifts. I don't know if the location matters). 
Then the people supposed to grab them would rush all together over them aaaand... Only 2 would come out carrying it, while 1 would be free of it.

Is there any explanation for this based on the fight mechanics?

[we will try and recreate it next time we raid so we can record it]."
0,Some More Info on the Confluence Wrong Warp (New Ascendant Challenge Routes),"Contrary to what I initially thought, you're not falling through the ground when you hit the confluence portals with someone in Chamber of Starlight. It's a straight up wrong warp. From the Confluence side, it drops you off rather close to the region's ascendant challenge. From the outside, it drops you off almost underneath the distant city, way out of the box. That's the side I used for [Queen's Court](https://youtu.be/FILbBr07oqw). Thanks to Steppe for testing and realizing that all those warps were to the same two locations.

Naturally, while it's only two locations, you can hit each in 3 different regions, making for 5 independent locations (6 if they ever fix Harbinger's Seclude's confluence portal). At least some of the ascendant challenges overlap partially, if not fully.

One of the wrong warp locations is suspiciously close to Chamber of Starlight, as well as three different Ascendant Challenges. The other is mysterious, but I wonder if it might be near the Morgeth portals. That requires more testing. It may hold clues into why these regions are chosen for the wrong warp, and if we're very lucky, clues into how to do this in other areas. I currently believe this sort of glitch was behind the [Corridors of Time teleport bugs](https://youtu.be/5sKOusBhH_s) where people fell out of the map.

&amp;#x200B;

Check it out for yourself here: [https://youtu.be/pum2El-fO8o](https://youtu.be/pum2El-fO8o)

&amp;#x200B;

In other news, if any of those portals had been inside of Confluence itself, we could be in Shattered Throne from patrol! Or if one of the load zones to Confluence miraculously extends outside of the box...

Anyone have any ideas how this bug could possibly work? Or how we might apply it elsewhere? If I'm right, it's existed in at least one other area with a completely different style of teleport."
0,Weird space platform in the EDZ.,"Hello, I've found this Video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF50TXUZ0tE&amp;ab\_channel=Az-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF50TXUZ0tE&amp;ab_channel=Az-1)) in which someone is somehow glitching out of the map into a weird platform from which you can see our galaxy.  
It looks like the spot where you could find Mara in Forsaken in the Dreaming City. I think it is related to the next season, or something with the Exo Challenge, maybe Clovis is going to predict some future events to us?

0,"""Of All Trades"" Challenge might require ""three-core rounds"" from the non-augmented players?","This is kind of a follow-on from the [current theory](https://redd.it/ka37nu) (i.e. each of the six players must complete one round with each of the augments over the course of the encounter).

Each round, three of the players will have an augment and three will not. 

**My thought was that, so that *all* players will have a role/""trade"" each round, the three players *without* the augment would *all* have to collect and deposit a core as part of the challenge.**

---

###The basis for this theory is:

- The Taniks (Phase 1) Encounter has **four** ""core dispensers"".
- The normal role of the operator is, at the start of each round, to shoot one of the glowing panels next to a dispenser.
 - If the operator does their role normally, then **two** bombs will be dispensed.
 - If the operator does **not** shoot a panel within ~15 seconds of the start of a round, then **three** bombs will be dispensed instead (and an extra core disposal box will become illuminated to the scanner).

It seems odd that:

1. This encounter can be completed entirely with the [operator not operating](https://i.imgur.com/jDAB3sp.png).
 - To be fair, this is also true of the scanner for the final boss fight if you are using the four core method, but that is heavily speculated to be the final DSC Challenge: ""The Core Four"".
2. Despite there being four dispensers, only three are active at any one time, and so a maximum of three cores can be obtained during any one round. 

They have also shown, both with the [wipe screen](https://i.imgur.com/H55fclY.png) and with the ""Short Circuit"" Triumph (*""Confront Taniks while allowing only one player from your fireteam to deposit nuclear cores.""*), that they have the ability to track who deposits the cores, so it could be possible that they are also tracking the augments of the depositors?

###**So what is the role of the operator during this run?**

My initial thought was that the operator would basically become a ""second scanner"": they can see which of the four dispensers will *not* dispense a core (the one with an inactive panel next to it), and so can direct players to the correct core dispensers before they are dispensed.

However, I think that everyone can see this anyway because the active dispensers glow yellow to everyone ([inactive](https://i.imgur.com/fRqVt3g.png), [active](https://i.imgur.com/3bVJcN7.png))? I can't confirm this because the yellow glow only becomes prominent after a few seconds and most operators (including myself) have normally shot a panel within a second of the round beginning. In this case, the role of the operator would just be to clear ads and *not* shoot a panel?

To ensure once we get a good run we can kill, I am curious what the best swaps are. Current plan is long shadow/adored/anarchy with titan swapping to bubble. Is the warlock better off running chaos reach or slowva, and is this the best load out for final stand? Console if it matters so accuracy of snipers may be slightly lower than on PC.

0,Of all trades challenge possible solution.,"Next reset brings us to our 3rd challenge for DSC. Of All Trades is the triumph. The challenge is for the 3rd encounter. I believe the challenge is to have all 6 guardians use all 3 augments during the encounter. If that is the challenge i believe i have a possible solution. After each nuclear core deposit phase (6 total), all augments will swap with their sub partner.. 

Hopefully this break down makes sense.
   
The numbering is head count of each guardian

(1/2)Scanner
(3/4) Operator
(5/6) Suppressor

1st phase: deposit core.
--between phases 1/2 , 3/4 , and 5/6 will swap their augments deactivated or not with each other-

2nd phase: deposit core
--between phases 1/2 need 3/4 augument. 3/4 need 5/6 augment. 5/6 need 1/2 augment. Everyone swap with respective augment. 

This gives everyone a turn at 1 augment and then they're passing it over to another pair.

Repeat these two core runs and by the 6th core deposit everyone should have done all 3 augments. 

If you have an understanding of my explanation but can break it down simpler or have another solution I'm all ears!

Guess we won't really know until reset. See you out there guardian."

Does this need to be a flawless attempt?  I've wiped a couple of times (FYI - individual sparrows will allow two wipes before it doesn't respawn back at the first bubble causing you to start all over from the beginning of the raid).

0,Discussion on internal names and devstrings from the game files,"I preface this post saying that all the content here comes from the game files. It isn’t particularly easy to provide proof of this, but I hope the evidence I provide is enough (or my previous posts here).

I've come across a lot of interesting internal names for things in Destiny 2 over the past few months, such as 'Blacker Hammerer' for Whisper or the Last Wish raid being called 'Beanstalk' [1] [2]. Most of them don’t mean too much and are made up on the fly (see the names of the packages, especially for crucible) [3]. However, some are definitely more interesting. 

The first interesting name is ‘veil’, referencing the Darkness. There is extraordinarily little information available for this. [Here’s a post on DestinyLore](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k7j7xv/the_name_veil/) that I found about it, which poses the word ‘veil’ in current lore as difficult to link to the Darkness. In the game files, there are a few references to the world veil. As seen [in this reference image](https://i.imgur.com/GX7xzbB.png), it specifically describes a “veil pyramid ship” and “veil statue”. This shows Bungie internally use the name veil as a reference to the Darkness, even if it may not be used currently in lore. 
Some may also spot the 'S13 ...' line which is in standard English, a very rare occurrence for game files outside the text files. These are left-over devstrings that describe how an activity happens. [This is the description](https://i.imgur.com/NxQ543Y.png) for the Deep Stone Crypt raid. Bungie, please get rid of these as some of them are quite telling of future content :)

The second interesting term is the ‘Dark Vanguard’. From what I know this idea is just a running theory that the new trio of Eris, Drifter, and Elsie represent a new Vanguard to represent the Darkness. This is referenced a single time in the game files shown [in this image](https://i.imgur.com/C9D8slF.png).

My last interesting term is for the wish plates. I’m able to identify how many wishes are active on the wish wall (of which there are only 14…), and funnily enough the wish plate sequences are named [‘gameshark codes’](https://i.imgur.com/8dnS11G.png).

This isn't much, but I think it provides an insight as to what Bungie is internally calling some bits and pieces.
I personally don’t like making distinct statements or conclusions about the future of the game, but merely present the information. Please don’t take it out of context of this being internally-used naming, as much of the internally-used names never get used in the live game or in lore.

Since there seemed to be about 8 spawn points throughout the entire staircase that didn't shut off when you got close, and that the area could sustain multiple Doom Fang Pauldrons Bottom Tree Sentinel Shields, I surmized it to be a better farming spot for Dawning Spirit. I did some testing and I got 122% Dawning Spirit gain in one hour, as indicated by the Triumph, Get In The Spirit.  


Is this faster than the thrall room with the slow effect?

0,Here's what the Dawning quest will end in,"Bungie clearly doesn't want us to fail this quest, as they tripled dawning spirit rewards recently which will allow us to complete the quest and eventually claim the overflowing dawning presents. But why?

Based on what Bungie has done in the past, I'd wager that it's a new exotic weapon, for four reasons.

\- Bungie doesn't like handing out cosmetics. That's putting it lightly. They used to have Dawning engrams as rewards where you could get the ornaments, but they removed that. The Prismatic Matrix? removed that. Individually, there are players who aren't really doing anything to generate Dawning Spirit but will most likely acquire the reward because the only other steps are to bake five cookies and deliver them to different vendors. Because cosmetics are Bungie's main source of monetization besides expansions and season passes, why give one out as the final reward of a quest involving MILLIONS of players when you can just sell it at Eververse? Bungie often also makes certain cosmetics more difficult to come by than certain exotics. Racking up 6,000 Bright dust playing on one character for a Dawning armor set is no easy feat, and look at how this stacks up against the exotic quests for Rat King, Traveler's Chosen, or MIDA.

\- On the other hand, we know that Bungie loves FOMO. Again, that's putting it lightly.  Heir Apparent exotic was one of the worst offenders, available for just three weeks during a seasonal event and it was tied to a super tedious quest, although this one was not a community event. Thunderlord, Arbalest, and Heir Apparent were all tied to Eva Levante's seasonal events in the past, so it's certainly possible it could happen again. At least Thunderlord and Arbalest were made into RNG drops after the event ended.

\- The other massive community event in Destiny's history rewarded an exotic quest (I understand the huge differences between this event and Corridors of Time, however the result is likely the same)

\- Finally, seasonal exotics (not counting Raid exotics) have come in threes ever since Joker's Wild. If this trend continues, we are still waiting on the third."

Went all the way through the reservoir in radio silence, killing taken with no feathers or birds that I could see, got to the end room, killed the boss (which actually spawned) and then decided to take a look around to see if there was anything weird.

Went up to door on the far top left (from where you come from in LoS) and had an interact box saying ""commune with the traveler"" (no traveler bird to signpost it).

Interacting with it spawned a traveler bird above the door and played me some dialogue where Crow wonders why that section of the reservoir is closed off, saying that there is only a broken ship in there. He then says that he had been sent on an errand to destroy it by Spider at some point, but had left it and claimed it as his own, trying but failing to fix it. The bird disappeared after, and the visual effect when a taken blight door is broken played (the door still remains sealed).

0,Solo Skip ALL of Garden of Salvation in Beyond Light (USING BLINK ONLY),"#VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/6tP-hfdY-tI

I wanted to demonstrate a full Garden of Salvation Solo Skip and Out of Bounds by doing it in a unique and challenging way, so I decided that Blink would be the best option for this.


Salvation's Grip made some of the rock climb a lot easier as a Blink Warlock.

100 Mobility and Astrocyte Verse helps a lot for the ""Astrocyte Verse Wall Climb with Nova Warp + Blink"" segment where I use my Super to help aid me towards to end of the rock wall. 

I then switch over to 100 Intellect and Transversive Steps, as I needed to wait for my Super 2 more times to get across hard obstacles.  For example, without the use of Nova Warp it seemed very unlikely that you could get around the ""Turn Back Zone"" at the top of the rock wall while using Blink, so super seemed necessary.

I also failed the radiolaria fluid lake towards the end with the 3 sword ammo I had left.  My idea was that I would blink and then tesseract over with Worldline Zero... but it was not sufficient and I fell down the vines and died in the lake.  With no ammo left, I waited for my Super again and used Nova Warp to get across. 

Overall, this was pretty fun and something different.  Maybe even the first ever **full** skip showcasing as a Blink Warlock, but don't quote me on that!


I hope you enjoyed and Merry Christmas!"

0,Need help with something for solo crypt security,"I’m trying to solo crypt security, but a problem i’m often facing is that when after I’ve identified the panels to shoot, during the joining allies a servitor always spawns on dark side. It’s happened so many times 

From experimenting I know that when you’re solo the servitor will always spawn on the opposite side of where you’re standing, but my problem is the timing of the servitor seems random. I’ve had runs where no servitor spawned, where it’s spawned very quickly (within 10 seconds or so), and where it’s spawned 2 servitors very quickly.

Does anyone have an idea of the servitor spawn timings after killing the vandal with the scanner buff? Is it a speed thing where I need to kill the vandal faster?"

0,“Of All Trades” Challenge roles,"From the name of the challenge for the Descent encounter, I think everyone may need to do every role in the encounter once. I would think it would just be the three augment buffs that each player must do, but it could also be that each player needs to deposit a bomb as well at least once. 

If this is the case, I’ve created a spreadsheet to help visually organize each player’s roles during each phase. My plan also takes deactivation into account by giving a player an augment only on every other phase to give enough time for the timer to run out. 

I’m not sure if this has already been done or not, I just wanted to share what I came up with.

0,Breaking into Queens Court in Beyond Light,"Ever since we lost the Quantum Finisher, we've no longer been able to [access](https://twitter.com/Djxyz0/status/1248138094236360704) [Queen's](https://youtu.be/gmCvKeHf0F4) [Court](https://youtu.be/WVPNaw5AlYI) at will. Sure, we could go once on week 3, but do we really want Bungie telling us where we can and can't go?

A few days back,  my buddy u/[Ironytheloreaxe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ironytheloreaxe) sent me a [curious video](https://youtu.be/n58BfUxA4T8) of falling through the ground while entering the confluence portal. With the help of u/stepmuffin, we eventually narrowed down the steps to reproduce to what is possibly the dumbest glitch I have ever seen. I was completely flabbergasted. It's hard to describe how ridiculous I found the whole thing. All you need to do to break the confluence portals is have a fireteam member go stand in the Chamber of Starlight lost sector in Rheasilvia.

With that mystery out of the way, it didn't take long to theory craft a route to Queen's Court. Utilizing the ironically simple teleport break, a bit of [infinite sparrow flying](https://youtu.be/mi4dT5WAnEI), and some good ol' [stasis climbing](https://youtu.be/yvyyeikvMcA), I was able to cross the vast expanse to reach Queen's Court once again.

&amp;#x200B;

Check out the results here: [https://youtu.be/FILbBr07oqw](https://youtu.be/FILbBr07oqw)

&amp;#x200B;

This was no simple task. It took [nearly an hour](https://youtu.be/6sGJN6SOuh4) to pull off, and most of that did not have room for breaks. However, it is theoretically doable on any character. I'd recommend a Titan though. You'll need Stasis unlocked, with Whisper of Shards, and high Discipline for fast recharge. I'd go for 100, but Khepri says 80 will cut it too. You'll want a sword to cross gaps if you're not cool enough to sparrow fly the full way, and a nice reliable gun for ice chipping.

I wonder if this is how the strange teleport in Corridors of Time worked. Might need to investigate other teleporters for similar bugs. I have no idea why being in one particular lost sector can break teleporters in 3 unrelated regions..."

0,Devrim Kay seems to be selling God Roll Armor this season.,"Hey again guys, 

I feel like this is worth posting here as I think it'll be extremely helpful for new light players and almost everyone looking for high stat rolls. 

For some reason, Devrim Kay appears to be selling insanely good stat roll armor this season, with a power cap of 1360. 

Last week, Ekuegan shared a tweet of Devrim selling Titan Boots with 30 Resilience and 20 Intellect.  https://twitter.com/Ekuegan/status/1339450127077920768

This week I've now noticed that Devrim Kay is selling Warlock Gauntlets with 30 Recovery.

https://youtu.be/EpiNLrF6bqU

&amp;nbsp;

I think if this trend keeps up, it should be a reset ritual to go straight to Devrim to see what he's selling... He's basically the XUR of Legendary Armor right now and not many people are aware.  I'm actually excited to see what he sells for Hunters. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'll mark this under discussion.  It could also be a glitch that the armor has a power cap of 1360.  Really not sure.   If you're in need of amazing stat rolls, hit up this Vendor now and keep an eye on him throughout the coming weeks."

0,You Can Combine the Debuff on the Atraks-1 Encounter,"Exactly as the title says. My raid team and I noticed that we kept losing a buff randomly and assumed it was a glitch but while we did challenge we realized that it might actually be a mechanic, due to the fact that we doubted Bungie would make the challenge force you to one phase. 

We lost one of the buffs then me and Hikari kept standing next to each other until we lost the other. When it happened he told me I was standing between the two buffs and picked them both up at the same time. 

We still ended up doing a one phase but this will definitely make it easier for people who can't do the one phase!

0,ATRAX BUFF DESPAWNING GLITCH *VIDEO INSIDE*,Hello! So I'm sure some of you are aware this is possible but I haven't seen a post like this yet so allow me to explain. During day 1 I remember shooting the Atrax buff off a teammates head and it despawned when another tried to pick it up. Since then iv found you can replicated this by having 2 teammates run in a corner and shoot it off their heads at the same time and have BOTH of their character models touch 1 buff. It works better when you have multiple people since it despawns more however this was used for the copies on copies challenge yesterday and WILL NOT WIPE YOU. This clip is from xbox one from my most recent run. Its pretty easy to do and iv replicated (pun intended) many times[Atrax despawning buff](https://youtu.be/bsbLr0-gRTU)
0,Efficient Route to get from Deep Stone Crypt's Entrance to 3rd Encounter (Skip 1st and 2nd) [1:56],"#VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/T8_AKpCzjig

A video of me utilizing my Sparrow to get up and Out of Bounds in the Entrance before the 1st Encounter and doing some Sparrow Launches along the way to essentially get outside Crypt Security's Out of Bounds. 

I proceed to jump down the pipe until I hit a load zone for the Atraks-1 area ""Clarity Control"" and then go back up.  Once I'm at the top I then hit the ""Morning Star"" load zone. I continue over to where a Checkpoint would initiate later on — once I've been in this spot this will auto-complete itself later on once the Atraks-1 encounter is completed. I then make my way back and load the ""Rapture"" load zone which loads up the area for 3rd encounter so I can then find an entry point to get inside which I show later on.  

You can use this routing for real in a speedrun or a general raid.  ***How?***   You will need to quickly make your way outside of the Atraks-1 door as the encounter is starting and the door is closing, then you can climb up and die, to which you will then respawn/death warp back to where this video actually starts.  

If done properly, you can execute what is shown and essentially pull your fireteam forward to the 3rd encounter once they've killed Atraks-1.  Quite technical, but pretty fun.  It's moreso used in Speedrunning, but thought I'd show the routing. Enjoy!

0,Atraks-1 cheese still possible fully solo,"I don't think I've seen any content about the Atraks-1 cheese being possible fully solo since you need to use a super to get through the door. So here's how I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to do it fully solo using the following method:

I used Heritage with recombination, Seventh Seraph shotty with trench barrel and The Lament. I was on hunter with the stasis super and using Mask of Bakris for some extra damage. The charged with light mods were: Stacks on Stacks, High-energy fire, Charge Harvester and Lucent Blade. I used one grenade launcher reserves and one shotgun reserves mod and a shotgun loader.

What i did was kill the two shanks at the pods to get two stacks of recombination, go upstairs and try to kill all 4 wretches with the stasis shurikens to get 6x recombination.

I did the glitch and usual then switched Salvations Grip for The Lament.

When I got to the boss to damage, I used the doge for the bonus damage, shot the recombination shot, then fired all 6 Seventh Serpah trench barrel shots, then changed to Heritage and unloaded it into the boss. By then I had another dodge charge, used it to reload Heritage and then used The Lament with the bonus damage from Mask of Bakris. Once I only had 7 sword ammo left, I changed to the shottys to unload them. I threw grenades whenever I could. 

I only had about 5/10 seconds after getting her health down to the final stand part to reload my guns and charge the sword melee so it's a bit tight. 

I thought I'd post this since I've not seen anything else about if it can be solo'd without a super. I hope this helps some people get the challenge!"
0,My Take on the Atraks-1 Challenge,"Me and some other people were discussing last night about the nature of the challenge and came to the conclusion that the challenge has yet to be figured out.

Reasoning: Currently it is a DPS check, kill Atraks-1 before you eject any replication buffs. This isn’t really a challenge, so much as asking groups to kill the boss as fast as possible.

Every single challenge in the past has been able to be completed in multiple phases (sometimes forced) and flawlessly (more on this later)


Currently, there are 2 known methods of doing multiple phases for challenge.

Method 1: “Combine” buffs by shooting off multiple near each other, condensing and reducing the amount you have to carry. I disbelieve that this is the intended way because this appears to be a glitch, not an actual mechanic.

Method 2: Eject players holding the replication from the airlock and chain resurrection. Also believe this is unintended because this only allows 2 phases and removed the flawless stipulation.

These are my thoughts on the challenge and I encourage us secret hunters and raiders to figure out what the challenge actually is. I’m going to include a list of challenges below that show what I mean about flawless multi-phase to show that there is a pattern.

Baths: No inherent reason it cannot be multi-phased or done flawlessly (having one person in the middle pool permanently)

Dogs: Challenge requirements reset each phase (each person can only shoot one spore per phase)

Calus: Closest we have to a DPS check, but allows multiple phases, which Atraks-1 does not

Kalli: No inherent reason you cannot multi-phase (activate all 9 plates each phase)

Morgeth: No inherent reason you cannot multi-phase (keep small ogres alive entire fight)

Riven: To remind of the goal, no player can shoot the same eye twice. There are 10 eyes per phase in groups of 2, 2, and 6. Each person can shoot 10 eyes so on a lucky run you can up to 6 phases without failing challenge, while an unlucky run could go through a minimum of 2. This is the best example of why Atraks-1 still has not been solved, as Riven was and has been 1-phased since early forsaken as the “usual” strategy.

IP Phase 1: Forced 3 Phase (Each person must pick up exactly 1 of each buff from underground)

IP Phase 2: no reason it cannot be multi-phased (each player shoots out exactly 1 shield generator on IP)

Deception: No inherent reason it cannot be multi-phased (each phase must have 5 shield breaks exactly)

Gal’ran: No inherent reason it cannot be multi-phased (each person shoots out one hand per damage phase, though it’s buggy and controversial, may be a max of 2 phases depending on interpretation)

Both Consecrated and Sanctified have mechanics based on the mechanics leading up to damage phase. No reason they cannot be multi-phased

0,Cookie Cutter Sword Meta.,"So originally I wasn’t going to post this but with new light players and heavy sword meta sticking around for a bit I decided to make my first post.

This is my generalised build across all three characters. The cookie cutter build do everything bar raids. So for the new players that are getting slapped around, this may be for you.

What you’ll need.

1 - neutral energy item (ie any element)

You’ll put charged up for gaining charged stacks from orbs. (Of course this is best used with masterworked weapons)

2 - 2x void energy armour for stacks on stacks and protective light.

3 - 1x solar energy armour for super charged.

4 - 1x personal preference for other mods.

How it works.

So essentially you are forgoing damage mods in preference of damage reduction which can be more helpful to newer players.

With stacks on stacks you’ll pick up 2 charges for every orb you pick up.

With supercharged you’ll be able to stack 4 charges.

With protective light and a 4 stack of charged with light, when your shields break you’ll receive a hefty damage reduction. This reduction lasts longer the more charges you have. When your shields regenerate you’ll still have the damage reduction (to my knowledge, I’m open to new info) which makes a character like devour lock or top tree sentinel ideal for this build but ultimately it’ll work with anything as it’s not weapon specific.

This build is focused around sword heavy. The reason being is the damage is so good for swords right now that for me, there’s no other alternative without owning anarchy. Your other 2 weapon slots are preference. The damage reduction from the mod build will help keep you on the field longer. 

Ideal build for 1250 lost sectors etc.

The 5th piece of armour you can slot whatever you want. Raise the charge stack to 5 or take powerful friends for mobility etc etc. There’s a few choices depending on what you want from it.

Fairly simple cookie cutter do everything sub raid. It’ll stand up to 1250 nightfalls and lost sectors and pretty much anything else sub raid.

Hope this helps a few folk. My first post don’t on my break at work. Don’t be to harsh."

Therefore you must hold all 4 debuffs until the first phase of the encounter finishes. This will repeat after each phase.**  

The cheese for this encounter will allow you to have 1 or even 0 debuffs, once you concluded the first damage phase. This cheese is pretty simple, all you have to do is have 2 or more players with debuffs stand next to each other. This can be done easily right next the drop pods when entering the space platform, there is a small area on either side that will confine the balls. This will be a very crucial part of this cheese, you wanted the operator to knock the debuff off when all players with the buff are in close proximity, when the balls are knock off and close to each other one player will try and pick them up. This will cause one or even a few balls to despawn."

0,Here's an original (to my knowledge) theory about Wish 15,"In season 15 (number coincidence, or not?) I believe Mara Sov will come back to the Dreaming City to end the curse.

In order to do this, though, she will need to bring back Sjur Eido, the first champion of the Awoken who promised before she died that she would rise again someday (Wish-Ender lore). I think that she knows something special about the darkness, and this is why she is required to break the curse. This is for two reasons:

\- She was assassinated and the Nine are heavily implied to be the perpetrators. The Nine must have had a reason, and they are all about balance. A strange coin, like Xur's from D1, was on her body.

\- She was the only documented person ever to survive an Aphelion attack, an entity of darkness known only to the Awoken and Calus.

I believe that with this season, once Sjur Eido is saved, Wish 15 will be introduced through a community puzzle like the Corridors of Time, and when it is entered on the wall Wish 15 will transport you to to the Distributary to fight an Aphelion. 

The Aphelion and Dreaming are two Awoken-known entities of the Darkness and Light respectively, and destroying a being of pure darkness in the Distributary will, through some primordial space magic, restore the balance of the Awoken realm in favor of the light and counteract Riven's curse, making the Dreaming City pure again.

Because of Sjur Eido's connection to the Nine, and the entities of pure light and dark, and the Nine's underlying connection to the Awoken (such as the Ahamkara, the Emissary, and Xur playing a part in the reef wars) I believe this plot of Season 15 would be the perfect opportunity to further the plot line of the Nine as well, first expanded on in Season 6. The Nine are going to have a large presence in Lightfall, if not the Witch Queen."

0,Riven dawning spirit cheese,"I was doing a last wish with my friends and went to give riven a cookie, and when i did so, my whole team got the loot and dawning spirit. This happened every time thereafter for every person that gave her cookies.

This means that you get about 180 dawning spirit max per person per 10 cookies. 1 run of your entire team giving riven 10 cookies each equates to 1080 dawning spirit generated and a crap ton of loot. If you have 100 cookies each, that's 10800 dawning spirit. If we got enough people doing this method, we would reach the 1 billion goal in a matter of days. Getting 2 teams of 3 to grind lost sectors at the same time for a few hours and then getting together with around 1000 cookies total would equal roughly 108000 dawning spirit just from 1 group of people. imagine if there was 10's of 100's of these groups doing this, we could get this done in days."
0,Atraks-1 Mechanic,I haven't seen anybody talking about this or any posts about it but it seems like if two people are carrying the purple ball debuff if you shoot that off of both of them and their balls fall near enough to each other that you can absorb that ball into the one you already have so rather than still having two balls you would then just have one making copies on copies far more manageable as long as when you drop the balls they are close enough to each other to absorb into each other on the ground

0,7th Penguin Location in Nexus,"The 7th penguin souvenir on Europa is located in Nexus. This one involves shooting Oracles. There are 4 oracles you need to shoot to spawn the penguin. 

1. The first Oracle will be available as soon as you walk into the Nexus where the room splits (left is the Glassway strike, right is the vex structure). It is located above the left side of the giant Vex structure in the middle of the room. It is pretty high, so look up. 
2. Second Oracle will be to the right of the room. Once you drop down on to the Vex platform (where the Wyvern spawns in the Warrior Empire Hunt that you have to kill to open the gate), stop and look down behind you, the oracle should be below in the kill area.
3. Third Oracle is located above the Vex structure/platform you are standing on. It is a bit to the right, and might be a little hidden behind the giant vex strut, so you may need to backup back to the area where the room splits to see it and shoot it. 
4. Fourth and final Oracle is located to the left side of the giant vex structure on the right side of the Nexus. As soon as you drop down on the Vex platform again, go left and run all the way to the back of the vex structure, and the Oracle will be right in front of you. Shoot it, and it will spawn the 7th penguin.

Hope this helps y'all out, I'm new to making guides, and I wish I took some pictures, but hope y'all can understand this!"

So My small theory is that Atraks didn't want to be resurrected again. 
I imagine that short conversation went something similar to:
Taniks, ""WWHHHHHYYYYYY""
atraks, ""The Guardians are back""

Then when he sees us he just wants revenge. 
But what It seemed like was, Taniks just didn't want to be brought back that last time."

0,Potential Darkness Enemy,"No clue if somebody already posted this, but in the Dreaming City, out of bounds, in the unreachable ascendant realm that is identical to the rock island that Petra stands on, there is a a sort of [miasma](https://imgur.com/a/er4DYue) on it, which, my friend group believes is the first look at a darkness enemy, here's why:  


Our theory of why this Miasma could be Darkness is mostly somewhat plausible because of [this concept art](https://imgur.com/a/7m99C7m)  


The concept art is clearly showing the Darkness, as there are black triangles (The Pyramids), a ghostly humanoid shape (The Nightmares or the mirror of your guardian, as seen at the end of the Shadowkeep campaign), and a mist/miasma.  


I also have a reason why I believe that this is not just some taken effect/aura, this particular ascendant realm has a much lighter background than any others, not only this, but there is many more particle effects that can be seen all around that aren't any other realms  


In a Drifter lore book (I do not know which one), The Drifter mentions creatures that emanate an aura that suppresses Light, similar to a Darkness zone, and he describes the creature as being ""a gooey, vacuous form with no head."" I feel that this description fits the bill pretty well, however, there is also a piece in Cayde's Journal which describes what is widely believed to be some sort of Darkness entity:

 ""Sky is torn open and there's nothing and nobody left in this ruined world but me and the **boiling shadow** all around. Whatever it is hits me before I can level my gun. Doesn't matter. Tendrils of pain crawl over my splayed fingers, my outstretched arms, my shoulders, my neck, my screaming mouth as it consumes. I'm being enveloped. Everything is wrong. Primordial. My systems go sideways. All but my sensors. It wants me to witness this, the world."" 

Here is the [image](https://imgur.com/a/J8IAjUk) that goes along with this part of the Journal  


Both of these lore pieces have some clues in them about the creature's shape ""Gooey, vacuous form with no head"" is a good description of the miasma found in the ascendant realm, and in Cayde's Journal, he describes it as a ""boiling shadow"", not only this, but I find that the word choice is quite interesting, ""**Tendrils** of pain"" I feel as though that may be somewhat describing the tendrils that come off of the miasma (however, I also acknowledge this being a stretch).

That's basically all of what I've gathered, please give feedback, as I would like to know as much as possible on this."

I've explored the Prodromus Down area (beginning area of Exodus Crash) from Nessus Patrol dozens of times before, helping clanmates get the two lore items by squeezing through Failsafe's backend and continuing into that area.

Prior to Beyond Light / S12, going through that gap let you fly over some debris and able to explore that area, just showing a patrol area change on your screen (like when normally traversing around patrol - see [(462) Destiny 2 - Breaking into Prodromus Down - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh-yyMnZQbw)). Now, when jumping over the debris you hit an instanced loading (the sound and black screen we all know).

No timer. No listed mission/objective. No way to get back to patrol. I've explored the area, scannables, cave system but can't find anything yet. But I have **no idea** why Bungie would change an area you could previously walk into without a load zone into an instanced zone.

Was this thing always scannable, or am I just a bid dumb idiot for thinking this is something new? I never remember thing being here, and especially with the Crow and other new Dreaming City shenanigans this season, I thought this might be something important.

0,Skip Vorgeth but Still Access Statue for Wish-ender?,"My son and I spent the afternoon Thunder Crashing our way past Vorgeth. We got out of the map and around Vorgeth no problem. 

But, we were unable to find a way to reach the statue, so I could interact with the statue for the first time in the Wish-ender quest.

After getting past Vorgeth, we tried a number of things to get a checkpoint/spawn at the statue.

We approached the statue, and were teleported back to the Vorgeth fight. We then: 
- Died in the fight, exited to orbit, and then spawned back in to see if we got a statue checkpoint. Nope. Back at the start of the Vorgeth fight.
- accessed the map, selected the Shattered Throne, and spawned in at the start of the Vorgeth fight. Darn.
- returned to orbit, travelled back to the Shattered Throne, and spawned in at the start of the Vorgeth Fight. Dammit.

We figured winding up back in the fight we were trying to avoid was a bad idea.

For our next attempts, we didn’t go towards statue.
- We walked in the opposite direction of the statue, and died as we plummeted to our deaths. We then revived: at the start of the Vorgeth fight. Grrrrr.
- We just returned to orbit after going around Vorgeth. We re-entered the dungeon, and we wound up at the start of the Vorgeth fight. We ran out of ideas.

In December 2020, is there any way to interact with the statue after bypassing Vorgeth? While we’ve put a lot of time and effort into going around him, we’ve spent a lot more than that trying to kill him.

We were doing this on Xbox, but we can also attempt it on PlayStation or PC if one of those would work better/offer a solution.

We did it together, but we could try it solo. He was carried through the dungeon previously, so he has his first interaction with the statue. I don’t have mine yet."

While I was farming Dawning stuff in here, I decided to think outside of the box and do something different utilizing Salvation's Grip.  

The first skip displayed in Thrallway is a lot easier to hit for any player, and the second skip is pretty cool as I've not seen Salvation's Grip utilized here to skip over to the Vorgeth entrance.  The 3rd skip (out of bounds only now) is the old Vorgeth Skip strategy that got patched and no longer works (does not yield the next checkpoint).  But this is a VERY consistent way of getting out of bounds and you don't even have to use blink anymore.  Not really sure if the first two strategies are useful at all to some in a speedrun scenario, so I just listed this as being situational at best, and for fun. Enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for watching!"

0,Strange mystery scannable on Wormhaven,"Tonight, I was exploring out of bounds on wormhaven when I found this. I don't think it's anything important, as it is in a turn back zone and nothing happens when you scan it, but I find it interesting in the first place. There could be more hidden discoveries out of bounds in the crucible that we don't know of.

[Link to video](https://youtu.be/sSv4uMb_ZOI)

Yes, this can be scanned from ""inside"" the map, but it is still in a turn back zone, and I find it easier to scan and see from OOB."
0,"Taniks fight, question on the primary","So I've got Anarchy and a great First In Last Out but I don't have a primary slug (yet🤞) so my question is this:

Do I use a regular shotgun (if so, what's a good choice), a sniper rifle (again, a good choice)  or experiment with a Chaperone and maybe a line rifle heavy or something (granted I don't rate this as a likely choice but it's safe to assume I know next to nothing compared to most of you 😛 so I thought throw it out there)

Anyway, thanks for the input and here's hoping Heritage rears its glorious head and makes my question irrelevant"
0,2-3 minute Lure Charge (Shattered Throne),"While farming the Lures out of boredom I noticed that Supers give 1% per kill rather than 1% every other kill with weapons (And 0% with some weapons like Trinity Ghoul)

[So basically 25 seconds with Bad JuJu and then super and you will gain about 25-35% each time.](https://imgur.com/YtjQGBH) Makes grind so much easier now with the buff to the charges as well."
0,Salvations Grip Door Breach 2.0 on Hunter - Patch 3.0.1.3,"[Hunter breach video](https://youtu.be/Vg5Nl8J83R0)

Patch [3.0.1.3](https://3.0.1.3) made it impossible to crouch while trapped in ice walls.

Supers like Code of the Missile (Arc Middle Tree) super on Titan forces the character to crouch, and Silence &amp; Squall (Stasis) super for Hunter moves the character back as well. This strategy is even more consistent than the old breach. The video I did only took one try to make it work.

Also note that you don't need much ice walls placed like what I did in the video. I just wanted more for fun, otherwise just place two walls on your feet (just like the breach 1.0).

Credit goes to Squirelockholms for doing the same strategy for Titan.

[Titan Breach video by Squirelockholms himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dcsm4ciWJg)

I've tested all Warlock subclass (especially Chaos Reach) but no luck for me. The same strategy might also also work in Last Wish.

Also thanks to Mooplays for sharing Squirelockholms's video and testing out other subclass with me"

0,"Corruption, Dredgen Yor, and a fistful of crayons.","Bear with me fellas, this is a long one.

So I heard conjecture recently on the subject of other darkness subclasses, on being discussed was that of corruption, more commonly known as soulfire. Guardians already wield Corruption in limited amounts, be it hive weapons or the effects of the original Thorn. No documented accounts exist of Corruption being utilized without slowly turning the wielder towards Sword Logic. 

I have noticed a pattern with releases in Destiny 2 as of Late. Both of the major expansions centered upon one Guardian race, With Forsaken being the Awoken, And Beyond Light being Exos. We're due for one focusing on standard Humans. Each expansion featured major players we hadn't seen since Destiny 1. With the return of Prince Uldren and Petra, as well as The Stranger, we can only assume that  this return is of some significance in the long run.

Here's where I go from vague Conjecture to pure guesswork. We have never directly met either Shin Malphur or Dredgen Yor. Yor is dead, killed by Malphur, but his ghost never died. The two parted ways before his final Confrontation with Shin Malphur. So I believe Dredgen Yor can be resurrected. He never genuinely lost his connection to the light, simply forgoing it in pursuit of his own madness. If he was to be brought back, it is almost certain he would have access to a throne world, due to his slaughter of countless lightbearers. The only other known throne world not belonging to the Hive is that of Mara Sov, to whom our resident Hive Expert Eris Morn is a close ally of.  Mara Sov's throne world is large enough to be a sizeable threat to our good friend Savathun the Witch Queen, who is most likely the focus of next year's expansion.

We have met friendly members of every enemy race except for the Hive. Calus, Mithrax, and the harpy on Nessus being our primary examples. While Eris Morn is an expert on the Hive, we have never been allied or even on steady ground with any ascendant hive members. leading me to believe that we will at some point meet one who sides with the Traveler or at the very least sympathizes with the ideology of Guardians.

Now how does this all tie together? I believe that in the next expansion, we will gain access to a new subclass under the darkness, most likely corruption (soulfire), and who is more likely to teach guardians how to wield it other than either Savathun herself or Dredgen Yor? The Original Hive or the Original Dark Guardian?

Alright, thanks for sticking with me as I rambled, this has been on my mind for ages now and I finally managed to stick it into something vaguely resembling Cohesion. Apologies for the disconnected thoughts and loose ends."
0,Possibly new aspect/fragment/exotic that can change titan super coming soon?,"I was re-watching the trailers bungie has made for Beyond Light and came across a very interesting scene showing a titan wielding not one but two stasis gauntlets when he activates his stasis super. The super/ability the titan casted was different because instead of sending 3 lines of stasis in multiple directions, it sends out one huge line of stasis rising up from the ground that has a different pattern than the stasis behemoth slam we know. I noticed that the icicles created by the super are also different as it's not pointy like the behemoth slam but more squared off like teeth. It looks like this ability is a one time thing as the titan stopped glowing with stasis after it so it probably won't be a roaming super if it actually is implemented into the game. The recent polygon interview with Luke Smith stated that the destiny team will ""sunset"" supers essentially condensing everything down into one super and not three. If we get aspects/fragments/exotics that can change our super to 1 of the 3 in the subclass then it might actually save destiny from sunsetting supers. An example of this would be inserting an aspect or fragment into the solar warlock that changes the dawnblade into a well of radiance.

P.S: This could all be a hoax and maybe this wasn't intended to be in the final cut but it's interesting that bungie showed us this during a trailer for the game. Don't take it too seriously it probably wasn't meant to be in the game."

0,Titan Sword+Stasis Melee patched?(And a discussion on skating strategies),"At the start of this season a new type of titan skating was discovered, with lion rampants, a sword, and the titan stasis melee. It revolved around jumping, swiping with the sword, swapping off the sword and using the stasis melee, swapping back to the sword and jumping again, swapping off the sword and using the normal melee twice, which for some reason gave you back melee energy. It sounds complex, but it is easily the easiest type of new skating as you have a lot of time to do the inputs. I was able to do this pretty easily but since last tuesday it seems like the swap back to the sword and off the sword is delayed, and it breaks up the skate. Am I now doing it wrong, or have you guys seen this.

I also made this post because I was trying to find the newest ways of skating/compile finds on it. There is this titan melee skate(which seems to be patched). On hunter there is a shatterdive worldline skate(which I cannot seem to get consistent with), a lament heavy attack skate(use lament, jumping while blocking, heavy attack and swap weapons and jump) which may or may not increase speed, and a block in air with lament into light attack into heavy attack while falling kindof skate really just way to sword skate in air on hunter. On warlock there are a bunch, first there is the well worldline skate(hunter shatterdive skate but with well instead of shatterdive). There is the top dawn normal burst+icarus skate. There is the top dawn sword swipe, swap weapons, skate. There are the lament skates: you can block, jump, swipe, swap weapons and icarus dash to go fast but I don't know how to do it consistently. You can block, jump, swipe, jump right before hitting the ground and then jump right after before doing the normal icarus which seems to be the fastest method(if you can get it down), faster than the normal swap skate bar well skating. Any other finds on these, and any new skates you guys have tried out?"

It unfortunately wasn't, but I decided to just throw my super and it and it ended up opening. Since shooting it won't activate it you don't have to worry about someone accidentally closing it.

0,Another version of farming ingredients for dawning in Shattered Throne.,"So I'm guessing all of you know the previous way known to farm the ingredients with the solar titan. 

I'm here to just share this setting so you could farm some other ingredients than the solar titan setting.

The whole point of this setting is three mods :

Light from darkness (void warmind mod)

Grasp of the warmind (void warmind mod)

Reactive pulse (arc charge of light mod)

How the build work goes like this :

1. Light from darkness gives you a stack of charge of light when you defeat opponents nearby a warmind cell.

2. Grasp of the warmind will make the warmind cell you're holding permantly exist, thus all enemies coming close to you would be affected by light from darkness forever.

3. Reactive pulse will kill the thralls that comes close and will also give a stack of charge of light back dying to the pulse.

This works best with warlock void bottom tree, or with any other class with 100 recovery for the best. This build can work crazily well at the thrall section on 2nd/3rd encounter. 

Thank you for reading the long post, and have a happy dawning guardians!

Btw you can literally afk as well with this build, just like the solar titan farm."

The best thing about this is that it doesn't consume a Lure Charge, so you can keep grinding this if need be. Takes about 3 minutes ish to solo and you get 15 Essence of Dawning each time you do it. Note that you won't get loot from finishing the Wrathborn Hunt as the Lure will have been reset.

0,Using glacial grenades to get through doors it's possible too 🥳,"Hello! Yesterday I've found a way to get all the way to the second chest of the raid DSC without using the exotic grenade launcher salvations grip. Instead you will use your glacial grenades from the stasis super. Using it correctly, it will serve for the same purpose of getting you through walls.

I haven't seen anyone using this method with the stasis grenades and I love to share it with everyone.

0,In depth DSC third encounter questions,"These questions are almost only applicable to speedruns (and even then they are VERY specific), so I'm sorry if this isn't the place, or if most people will find this useless. But any help or theories would certainly help.

1: Is there a bias as to what augment gets deactivated? It would appear, to us, that operator and suppressor at far more likely to get deactivated than scanner. You'd assume to see a 1/3 chance over a large amount of runs, but that's not the case. The further question is then, are there set strings for which augments that get deactivated? Sort of like calus. Or is the order based on some unknown trigger, like ad clear etc.

2: When spawning the first nukes it is possible to spawn them by killing 50, 60 or 70 ads. Why is there a difference? Shouldn't it always be the same? Is there a certain order of killing ads that dictates the amount of spawns or is it simply random?

3: Do you have to kill captains to progress the encounter at max speed? Or is there a certain amount of ads you have to kill for each wave, because then it's be quicker to leave all captains alive.

Thanks in advance."

Here are some videos that I have put together that aggregate multiple methods to get both ""hidden"" Last Wish chests for each subclass solo using only 1 wish per character. 

The key to getting the Shuro Chi chest is to use a pretty easy OOB. The only catch is you might need to set your Resolution to 1080p and cap your Frame Rate to 30 prior to getting into the loading zone. This is because the loading zone may kill you if your frames are too high.

Video: https://youtu.be/2PdF8sEEe3A

(Note: In the video, I only managed to get through the first door before running out of ammo on Salvation's Grip.

(1) Use the hole in the lower floor of Crypt Security to go out-of-bounds

(2) Follow the path in the video to enter Rapture and backtrack to Morning Star

(3) Use Salvation's Grip to get through both doors

(4) Backtrack through Morning Star to claim the chest"

 Does anyone know what causes him to start moving? Over the weekend, 50% of our attempts had him moving to snow/spawn very early. Despite spawnkilling all the dregs/captain/vandal, Taniks would be in place and unleashing purple death within moments of picking up the Operator augment from under him.

 The next attempt would have him sat in the middle for &gt;30s since clearing, before casually drifting to orange. Any ideas what controls this?"
0,Six Man Patrol (Europa and Dreaming City),"I've been doing some messing around from Deep Stone Crypt and Last Wish, and it turns out you can break out into patrol zones in both.

For Deep Stone Crypt, this gives you basically the full patrol experience, minus, like, patrols, since you're already in an activity and can't start a new one. Can't launch flags either for the same reason, and because of player limits. You can, however, do public events and normal lost sectors.

Dreaming City puts you in a pseudo patrol. Only Blind Well is public. Everything else is private, leading to the three normal public areas being completely devoid of life. No ads, no random guardians, no corsairs, and no Petra. The privately instanced offshoots are all normal. And the Strand Diving Board is disabled, so you can freely explore [the Ascendant Realm](https://youtu.be/zJgL4kKf2UM) down there. 

I'm issuing two challenges to you fine folks:

1. Get a 6 man fireteam on Europa where everyone has their own tank.
2. Get into Spine of Keres after completing the Last Wish Queenswalk instant clear cheese.

Both should be possible, but the second seems pretty difficult.

my question is, how are you able to complete the boss with a team consisting of void subclasses?"

0,"[Bug] Debuffs do not work on Atraks-1, only the captain outside of the map.","TLDR; Despite showing more damage in the wipe screen, applying a debuff to Atraks-1 does the same amount of damage as applying no debuff to Atraks-1. However, you can apply a debuff that works for everyone damaging by applying a debuff to the captain outside the map that hold's Atraks' health bar.

Video showing/explaining this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYFWimMqno&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYFWimMqno&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

To start this, damage numbers do not work properly on Atraks-1. They do not translate to actual damage during the encounter. In the video provided, it is seen that although applying a debuff shows more damage in a wipe screen, they do the same as not using a debuff. My clanmate Scrub and I tested this by having me go out of the map and apply a debuff to see if it made us actually do more damage. We found that applying a debuff to Atraks-1's Exo body in bounds may not work, applying a debuff to the captain in the out of bounds actually makes everyone do more damage to Atraks-1 how applying a debuff normally would."

0,Fast Movement: You can send yourself flying at lightspeed with Lament.,"TLDR; doing an air heavy attack with lament when an enemy does an animation/gets stunned you go flying. (%100 works on Shuro Chi and Kalli, unsure of other bosses).

With Lament, the lunge on it is noticeably buggy, as you can tell from gameplay. This was amplified when doing a Last Wish today, as I noticed that during Suro and Kalli I would go flying when doing my combo with the sword. After testing it, I consistently got sent flying when doing an air combo and heavy attacking when Shuro flinched. For the other players in my game, I did not move at all and it just appeared as I randomly died.

Although I am only %100 about Shuro and Kalli, it very well should be possible to do this on other enemies who have noticeable flinch. Have fun zooming!"

0,Secret message hidden in Legacy Pt 2 lore tab?,"So call me crazy but I think there might be a secret hidden in the [Legacy Pt 2](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48825) lore tab.

Not sure if anyone's picked up on it. I did a few searches but saw no one mention it. But basically half way down you see this text:

&amp;#x200B;

 *ECHO- 2̷͉͙̜̗͍̙̭̤̘̪͖͈͛̅͑̈̀̾6̸̡͇̼̦̲̩͎̟̠̬̳̲̂̀̉͐̃̈́ͅ2̵̡͎͚̳̠̫̮͉̍̉̌̒͑̓͗͛̉̈́̕̚͝5̸̨̭͚͔̥̲̫̈́̂̈́̊̋͗͑͛͑͝͝* 

&amp;#x200B;

And then it's repeated further down

&amp;#x200B;

 *ECHO- 2̷͉͙̜̗͍̙̭̤̘̪͖͈͛̅͑̈̀̾6̸̡͇̼̦̲̩͎̟̠̬̳̲̂̀̉͐̃̈́ͅ2̵̡͎͚̳̠̫̮͉̍̉̌̒͑̓͗͛̉̈́̕̚͝5̸̭͚̈́̂̈́̊̋͗͑͛͑͝͝- Present Day* 

&amp;#x200B;

So there are what appears to be 4 bands of ASCII glyphs. But what's interesting is that if you convert the glyphs of the two ""2625"" sections and compare them they are almost identical except for the last spinner on the second iteration.

I actually converted it to ASCII decimal codes and [plotted it on a graph](https://imgur.com/a/oN0p1rm).

So it's basically just the section after ECHO-  and before - Present Day. The dips are the low ASCII characters ""2"" ""6"" ""2"" ""5"" and the peaks are the garbled glyphs. There also seems to be repeating 204 and 205 characters which are ""box drawing characters"", presumably to orient it acrostically. 

But what's interesting is that the second iteration has about 10 characters of extra data.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What's also interesting is some of the surrounding lore, including in the first part of: [Legacy](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48812)

So basically Ana finds a Bray Facility on Mars called Clovis 9 and within she finds two dead Exo's. She then finds:

&gt;Between the bodies lay a sleek instrument, sized for crew deployment and **dressed in precious filigree tendrils rimmed in calligraphic etching**. The instrument’s core **links to multiple platinum discus drums implanted into its frame**, resembling the smaller resonators on Ana’s helmet, and ends with a hopper-crown of artificial diamond bearings.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Here's what they used to crack the entrance door."" 

It also seems to interact with her helmet and we get some weird alliteration throughout referring to the resonance of her SN0MASK helmet.

Later after a weird detour from what's presumably the Darkness she ends up at Caelus Station orbiting Uranus. On board they find and converse with a frame and the frame says: 

&gt;“ECHO project requires a station link with &lt;**VERBAL CIPHER ENGAGED&gt; DEAD-ROCK &lt;VERBAL  CIPHER DISENGAGED&gt;** resources.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ana eyes go wide. “Jinju disengage that cipher thing.”

Before she Jinju can do anything she gets shot through the chest by a rogue Exo on board the station. Before she blacks out we read:

&gt; Howling storms slam **salt-coarse keys** in Ana’s helmet. 

We then get what seems to be the memories of each echo/reset of the Exo who shot her. They go as follows  ECHO-1, 0, 7, 22, 41, 89, 173, 390, 877 and then we finally get to 2625 with the weird glyphs.

She then comes back to life, has a fight with the Exo, wins and then she goes over to the console at Clovis Bray's desk  

&gt;Jinju nudges her shoulder. “I've got the mainframe data.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ana is devoid of thought at the mainframe access console. She watches as Uranus comes back into view over and over again. It dominates the station’s viewing port. **She maps the movement of the clouds along the surface, but only ever on the surface, and sees how they differ from the previous iteration on their last spin.** She wonders if they are different underneath.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stable major chords strum in Ana’s helmet, getting caught in the cracked visor glass.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So after reading all that a couple of things stuck out at me. 

* Firstly, she has some kinds of device with rotating metal drums with calligraphic etchings that the previous Exo's used to open the door. The device seems to interact with her SN0MASK.
* We have what seems to be a public key of sorts - DEAD-ROCK - which has a verbal cipher attached. And then her helmet lights up with ""salt-course keys"" which [salted keys in cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))
* We have the 4 ring glyphs surrounding the number 2625 that is repeated twice, slightly different on the second iteration.
* When she's looking at the mainframe access console, she seems to be mapping the clouds on Uranus - but its sounds exactly like the glyphs - **they differ from the previous iteration on their last spin.**

Keys, Iterations and Salts are common words used in Cryptography

[**https://www.adamberent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KeyIterationsCryptoSalts.pdf**](https://www.adamberent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KeyIterationsCryptoSalts.pdf)

So it really kinds feels like there's a secret buried in here that will unlock exactly what the ECHO-LINK points to and what DEAD-ROCK is a cover for.

Now I'm not an expert at cryptography but I did try a few things, including removing the repeating characters, performing a XOR between the two and seeing if it matched any known cryptographic algorithms like MD5 and SHA-256. I've also tried using different alphabets and unicode.

But being the layperson I am when it comes to this I really feel like I'm stabbing in the dark. So if there's something in here please let me know. 

Or feel free to call me crazy."

0,Veil statues : The Lightfall Race or the Jebait by Bungie?,"Recently my fireteam and I were exploring the out of bounds route in the Deep Stone Crypt when I saw something very weird. 
I had heard about the Veil statues mid air on the Cosmodrome. And when I saw this I immediately assumed that there could be more. Here is a link to the picture of the statues that I assume are Veil statues. 

https://photos.app.goo.gl/4iK27LJMqFAhQZLw5

Does this probably mean that there could be statues like this around the system?
Is Bungie trying to indicate that the Veil are the end race we might face in Lightfall if it is the end the franchise? Or could it be the classic Bungie jebait we all dread. 

Let's hope the Veil are an actual thing and inclined to the darkness. 

If anyone wants to try to find these statues you have to make a out of bounds skip in the jumping puzzle of the Deep Stone Crypt where you  cannot let the inside appear. Angle yourself in a way to avoid the appearance of the insides of the ship and you should be able to see it. 

Apart from have a great day, Guardian."

Currently the two blocked exits from the hawkmoon arena lead to this area, one being the door that gives a crow/glint voice line, and the other being the taken barrier you cannot pass.

0,Clovis Bray Dot Language Puzzles/Secrets,"I've been watching this sub for a while now, and I decided to go out and find the main components to this sort of Dot Language Puzzle. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/AJnlaSn), I've collected all the images I mention.

It all starts with [the keyboard](https://imgur.com/RKyafbE), which specifies a dot pattern for a handful of keys on a keyboard. The language itself is pretty simple: each character is represented with either 3 or 4 dots, arranged in a 2x2 box grid (either all 4 boxes on the grid are filled, or one box is left empty). There are a few different types of dots as well, such as a filled dot and an empty dot. I once suspected there to be a dot that was partially filled, but upon further inspection, I concluded that there are only 2 different dot types. **If anyone has a high resolution of these puzzles or keyboard, without the screen's motion lines, it would be very much appreciated.**

Now for the puzzles. I'm sure you've seen these scattered about Europa and the DSC. What I've found is that there are many different orientations for this puzzles, with some being mirror images of others, and some being spun around. I don't know if the orientation means anything, however, I'm just going to mention the 2 puzzles I found in their, so to speak, ""correct"" orientation.

[Puzzle 1](https://imgur.com/HJX53uU) seems to be a more simple version of [puzzle 2,](https://imgur.com/EQemk17) with their only being 1 red variable (referring to the flashing oval in red). What these puzzles represent is unclear, however, I do hope to understand them in the near future, with (what I'm hoping will be) the challenges coming to the raid bring with them the secrets of the DSC.

The last thing I would like to mention is the [class items](https://imgur.com/LgQvKo5) received from the DSC. The line of text ""\^\*##()\_+\^/"" is seen on each class item, and for the warlocks, on their chest armor. When I converted what I could into Dot Language, nothing of notice seemed to appear, as it didn't match the puzzles or any other screens around Bray Tech or the DSC. 

I hope this language is brought to use soon, and I wish you all the best of luck deciphering the Crypt's secrets."
0,Glitched inside Reservoir turbine area,"I knew there was a way inside and after trying enough stuff, I finally found it.

How to do it:

*  Get out of the map in The Reservoir area.

There are plenty of holes to choose from.  Pick your favorite.

*  Go around to the boss area.
*  Follow it around until you get to a room that looks like a box.
*  Crouch underneath the box-room.
*  Kill yourself while crouched under the box-room.

This will make your Ghost appear half in/half out of the room.

*  Have a team-mate revive you.
*  Wiggle around until you fall through the floor, and into the Turbine area.

* Explore.

----

This isn't super easy to do.  I got lucky and got it on the first try.  Then again on like the 20th try.  But keep at it and you'll get it too.

It's pretty cool in here.  Fully finished.  Plenty of enemies.  Unfortunately it doesn't lead to the ship area, but it does look like there are 2 big red hangar doors that open to reveal the ship at some point in the future.

0,Hawkmoon: Store Paracausal Shot on Last Bullet,"By switching guns in the middle of a super animation, you can store the charges on hawkmoon on the last bullet. I tested this mainly with warlock subclasses, so I'm not sure what other supers this works with, but it seems to work with any non-roaming/shutdown supers with a cast animation - Well of Radiance is the most likely candidate, but I got it to work a few times with Nova Bomb. [Here's a clip of it working with Well.](https://imgur.com/eRMFIdv)

I'm not sure exactly what this could be used for, and it seems pretty niche, just thought I'd share. I haven't tested this yet, so I'll update this post when I get around to it, but I suspect you could do something similar with certain finishers that allow weapon switching during, which would be a much more consistent and usable functionality than burning a super just to store an extra charge."

In the Bray Lab Records- Confidential lore book in The Darkness lore tab, entry 4- Test No:312- Exo Arm Attachment- listed under identities is the name H. Rasmussen, one of the 3 founding members of the black armory is Helga Rasmussen, now possible theories is that before the collapse and before the darkness, Helga Rasmussen worked on the exo program with Clovis Bray, now if it is the same person from Black Armory, there is a possibility that Rasmussen might have essentially brought this research from Clovis Bray to BA, and this tech was used to create Ada-1, I have only unlocked 2 of this lore book and it is time gated.

[https://gyazo.com/380ffa73869f68a2c75a4948d20baf3c](https://gyazo.com/380ffa73869f68a2c75a4948d20baf3c) also in this entry Clovis Bray directly calls Rasmussen by first name- Helga, so this confirms that this is Helga or Bungie would've probably chosen a different name, also during the golden age, human life doubled or tripled or extended longer than 100 years, so it is possible this is a younger Helga.

This lore book is obtainable through the augmented triumphs to shoot the drones.

**CAYDE-01**

In the lore of the new raid helmet for deep stone crypt, cayde-1 is chatting with one of his exo friends- Knox-4, and after a brief conversation, they hear a sound from an evesdropper on their conversation and pursue. Now in the lore entry in Dusk and Dawn called Your friend, Micah Abrams there is more information. In this lore book, a child named Micah Abrams came to europa with his father, a shrink who is helping with the exo project, in entry 5, the latest entry- he is actually the one thats evesdropping on cayde's conversation, and the entry ends with him being caught by cayde and knox but we don't know what happens next so there is quite alot of speculation for what may happen next to the child.

the lore can be found in collections for the helmet

and this is what matched with the ending of both of the entries

0,Taken captain boss in the reservoir (EDZ) mystery,"Taken captain in the reservoir(EDZ) mystery

The pathway to the dam or reservoir from one of the hawkmoon missions is open in patrol. It has the same adds and bosses. This could be a bug or something but I doubt it. Once you reach the boss room there is a taken captain similar to the one you fight in the hawkmoon quest. This taken captain seems like it can only be killed by using hawkmoon. I tried using fallen guillotine and almost right away it teleported away. ( I don’t recall if this happens in the mission.) 

To be clear you can damage it with other weapons and your super but it just seemed to run away almost immediately. When I used hawkmoon I got it down to about 1/4 of its health then it ran away. 

What I think could happen when you kill it is that it might open up the rest of the reservoir that available in patrol. (They added more than what was in the mission and it’s pretty big. Figured this out by getting out of the map.) and I’m not talking about the strike area of the reservoir, there is a door that’s blocked by taken energy in the boss room that leads to a much bigger part of the reservoir that’s kinda like a small jumping puzzle. 

Another thing I think might happen is the hawkmoon mission area in the sludge lost sector (forgot the name) may open up and maybe the captain flees to that area. 

There is also enemies throughout the reservoir that are blocked off by doors 

this might not be anything but it’s something I haven’t seen anyone else talk about."

Restricted 1.0 being pre-crash, and Restricted 2.0 post crash. They occupy the same physical space, leading to lots of fun visual effects. There's no real benefit since as soon as you start the encounter, everyone in Restricted 1.0 gets joining allies'd back to 2.0. 'Course one never really knows if there won't be a bug with that down the line, but for now it's just a nice party trick.

Originally I tried expanding on my [previous](https://youtu.be/1y5a-MmMfmE) efforts. In my last attempt, I managed to successfully navigate the white void and reach Clarity Control, however this just left me in the Clarity Control/Rapture trap, with no way to continue. I intended to try never entering the third encounter area so I'd have a respawn point outside of the map, however plans changed after an unfortunate wipe. Luckily I managed to evade both death, and the blinding white trap of post-encounter Rapture by loading Clarity Control during the escape phase.

Check out my guide on that here: [https://youtu.be/1y5a-MmMfmE](https://youtu.be/1y5a-MmMfmE)

From the Season Pass Transmat Effect being two Izanagis crossed underneath a skull ([light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/575614550/stalkers-entrance/)) and the exotic emote Victory Pose having your guardian hold an Izanagi ([image](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1601/16018044/3758964-destiny22020-11-1118-36-20.jpg)), the new Eververse cosmetic sets being all Izanagi themed, [new text supposedly showing up where the forges were](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/jrz8ht/forges_gone_new_writing_in_the_area/), and [this lore entry in one of the raid armor pieces that ends with Ada-1 stating that the armory must evolve.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/legacys-oath-mask?highlight=ada-1)    


I think it's fair to say that something bigger than just some quest is coming in regards to the Black Armory. This might be as blatant of a tease as Bungie has made, compared to how they have teased prior activities through cosmetics, like Zero Hour. While I wouldn't bet on next season being BA themed, I do think that we will be getting one for it eventually, may it be after Season 13 or in Witch Queen."

Bungie said yesterday's D2 patch would temporarily disable the friend's list under the Roster menu. They further stated that the work around was to use the PS4 Friends menu to join someone else's game. 

This morning neither I nor my friends were able to join each other through the PS4 menu. But one of our friends reported that his Roster -&gt; Friends list was still working. He proved it by joining one of us before logging off for work. I only had 108 friends in my PS4 friends list, so I deleted 8 of them. I'm now down to 96 friends.

0,Deep Stone Crypt symbols match Mind-Body Dualism,"Not sure if this has been mentioned but one of the symbols in the Clovis Bray mysterious log book (that is also seen around the Bray installations on Europa) bears striking resemblance to  René Descartes' illustration of mind/body dualism. 

[This is the image in question](https://imgur.com/a/NceMrj1) 

René Descartes' (who famously said ""I think, therefore I am"") believed inputs were passed on by the sensory organs to the epiphysis in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit. [Dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism) itself differs from Monism in that it assumes the Mind and Body are distinct non-identical entities as opposed to manifestations of a single substance.

This is something known as the [Mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem) 

&gt;*The* ***mind–body problem*** *is a debate concerning the relationship between thought and* *consciousness* *in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically, as that question presupposes an* *interactionist* *account of mind–body relations. This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature* 

So clearly this was an important problem in the field of Exo science as in Destiny there is clearly a duality between the human mind and the Exo body.

The image above stuck in my head because of the hourglass because after hearing ""an hourglass counting down with infinite patience"", this was actually the first reference to an hourglass in-game that I have encountered.

You can see further imagery from Descartes' papers [here](https://www.thinglink.com/scene/898624233008005120) and [here](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:61027:20160525060914341-0931:07916fig5_1.png?pub-status=live).

Now one thing I noticed is that in Descartes' image all the lines point to an arrow but in Clovis Bray's diagram they point to an hourglass. The arrow reminded me of the [arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time) (*time's arrow, the concept positing the ""one-way direction"" or ""asymmetry"" of* *time*) and in particular [Entropy as an arrow of time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(arrow_of_time))

&gt;**E****ntropy** is one of the few quantities in the physical sciences that require a particular direction for time, sometimes called an arrow of time. As one goes ""forward"" in time, the second law of thermodynamics says, the entropy of an isolated system can increase, but not decrease.  

My research led me to a very interesting paper from Yale University entitled ""[The Mind Body Problem and The Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://www.newdualism.org/papers/H.Morowitz/Morowitz-1987.htm)"". Within it seemed to confirm my suspicions about the arrow:

&gt;*The picture Descartes offers is that of the soul directly moving the pineal gland and thus affecting the ""animal spirits"" which he considered the hydraulic transmission system of mechanical changes in the body; consonant with his views on the conservation of motion,* ***it is only the direction****, and not the speed, of movement* ***of these spirits that is affected by the soul****.* ***This is the direction of action of the*** ***will.*** *In the opposite direction, changes in the body - such as the effect of external objects in the sense organs - are transmitted to the pineal gland by the spirits and can there affect the soul by causing sensations in it.* 

The Cartesian view of mind-body dualism is the idea that the activities of the mind cannot violate the conservation laws of physics but only effect choices, i.e., direction. Makes sense.

But the real clincher was in the abstract:

&gt;*Cartesian mind body dualism and modern versions of this viewpoint posit a mind thermodynamically unrelated to the body but informationally interactive. The relation between information and entropy demonstrates that any information about the state of a system has entropic consequences.* ***It is therefore impossible to dissociate the mind's information from the body's entropy****.* ***Knowledge of that state of the system*** *without an* ***energetically significant measurement*** *would* ***lead to a violation of the second law of thermodynamics****.* 

# It is impossible to dissociate the mind's information from the body's entropy.

In other words entropy and its associated arrow of time is a significant barrier to dissociating the mind from the body. Any information about the state of a system has entropic consequences and therefore if we try to read the state of the system without an energetically significant measurement it would in fact ***lead to a violation of the second law of thermodynamics****.* 

Now the nature of this **energetically significant measurement** is detailed further in the paper. It came in the form of a thought problem known as Maxwell's demon or the sorting demon.

&gt;*. . . imagine a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in his course, and would be able to do what is at present impossible to us . . . Let us suppose that a vessel is divided into two portions, A and B by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being who can see the individual molecules opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from A to B, and and only the slower ones to pass from B to A. He will, thus, without expenditure of work raise the temperature of B and lower that of A, in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.*  
&gt;  
&gt;For many years the paradox of the demon troubled students of the foundations of physics.

So in other words, if such a demon existed with the ability to see the individual molecules they would be able to make heat flow from two gases in thermal equilibrium in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

A man named Brillouin later solved the paradox. He showed that even if such a demon existed and regardless of how sharp it's faculties were - every time it observed a molecule this would release a minimum amount of energy (since radiation is quantized).

In simple terms, that means:  

# The act of the measurement requires the expenditure of energy equal or greater than that recoverable from the supposed violation of the second law, thus restoring the range of that law. 

So basically once we took into consideration that the act of measurement in itself expended energy - the whole problem no longer violates the second law of thermodynamics. Paradox solved! 

But that kinda sucks if you are trying to *dissociate the mind's information from the body's entropy* in order to seed an Exo mind - because as I mentioned this is IMPOSSIBLE to do without **violating the second law of thermodynamics**. But what if there was some version of this demon that could violate the second law of thermodynamics and measure without that expenditure of energy in our universe?

Well I think Clovis found it.

# Clarity

I think that's why Clarity was so important to Clovis and why the symbol is an hourglass and not an arrow. You see from the mysterious logbook we know that Clarity has the effect of irreversibly lowering the entropy of a substance in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, a phenomenon we see in Stasis (read [Stasis does not create Ice. It creates Perfect Crystals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k0mr5c/stasis_does_not_create_ice_it_creates_perfect/)). 

It's the missing piece of the puzzle he needed to transfer consciousness to the Exo minds.

# That's why it's an hourglass!

An arrow can only move in one direction in both space and time. An hourglass on the other hand can be reversed in both space and time by simply turning it around. An hourglass represented a perfect duality between the natural entropy of the universe, and the reverse entropy of Clarity. Two reversed arrows in time combined to form an hourglass.

I hypothesized almost 2 weeks ago that [Clarity is a Maxwellian Demon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k1dugp/clarity_is_a_maxwellian_demon/) because it seemingly violated the second law of thermodynamics when it reduced the entropy in the Radiolaria as well as when we use Stasis. 

But I think this is much bigger than that - Clarity solves the **Mind Body Problem**.

Without Clarity, Exominds **cannot** exist."

I tested out a few things and noticed that it doesn't teleport away instantly, it stays there until you shoot it and then teleports away. 

So, I went in with Hawkmoon and managed to get the 7 stacks and used bubble for extra DPS, but I wasn't able to kill it solo. I'm wondering if you need to bring extra people and everyone shoots it with one shot of the Hawkmoon with full stacks.

Here's some images of what I'm talking about. First image is just it being there still after immunity bubble is gone, second image is the amount of damage I was able to do with one shot and a grenade.

0,Guided Games are Either Bugged or Completely Broken," Today guided games were added to Deep Stone Crypt, and my clan decided to guide one for the shits of it. Since Last Wish, Bungie stopped giving out emblems for being a guide which made me have no motivation to do them at all. But when we hopped in DSC, we were shocked by what happened.

Ressurection tokens were gone, and you could just res whenever you want, nobody needed to help you out. It was a darkness zone, but even if everyone died you could just res yourself and stop the wipe.

No loot was gained from any encounter, and at the final boss, we were instantly sent to the boss after completing the raid. We didn't even get Spoils of Conquest. The raid counted on [raid.report](https://raid.report/), but not actually inside the game. Our tracker still said 0 Deep Stone Crypt guided games.

Our group was split on if this was a bug or national to help new players through the raid, but personally, I believe it was a bug. Unless I missed something in the patch notes this was not said anywhere that GGs would be changed. Although, it is very possible that it is intentional, as even though the raid is almost a cakewalk with these rules, you get no loot meaning that the endgame chase is still there.

So Bungie, if you're reading this it would be nice to receive some confirmation on what is actually happening. If I just missed this in the patch notes, sorry for the fluff post!

An important thing to have in mind if you drop like I do is to know that there is a killzone next to the wall so you have to move a bit sepparated. Once you are past the tubing section it is much easier to traverse.

Behind the locked doors in the boss room there seem to be a series of big rooms with rotors in them. The area looks pretty big and some corridors sprout from them. It definitely looks like there is also enemy activity (still taken I think since one of them clipped outside).

*""Confront Taniks while allowing only one player from your fireteam to deposit nuclear cores.""*

Kind of annoying IMO...basically just have two people stand with cores, and one person dunks and then takes the core from the other person to dunk. 

I guess discuss strats or whatever else here too. How many radiation stacks do you lose in-between core spawns?

Maybe a better strategy is to have any people pick up cores and run them to the bins, and then one designated ""core dunker"" who will take the orbs from the runners and dunk them instantly?"

raidsecrets,Bunker E15 Warmind cheese?,"So i was running Legendary lost sector bunker E15  and got to the second mob, 4 goblins, and accidentally spawned a warmind cell near the window (where you can see the other two cages). I blew it up and to my disbelief both the cages poped open and they started clearing the room! I cleard mob three and entered the room with nearly all first wave mobs dead and the turret spawning in. It was so crazy! 

I tried it a few more times and it always worked, but if you stay out of the room to long the 4 soldiers will start walking to the boss room while the second wave is spawning leaving you with only 4 soldiers instead of 8. But if you dont lag around i think this is a great cheese!",1615990366,2021-03-17 10:12:46

raidsecrets,New Frostbite glitch + jump section on Hunter w/o stasis or sword ammo,"\*Language Warning\*

Drive sparrow into forstbite area + jump off and step back out of frostbite, jump back on when frostbite = 0

Takes a little practice to get the jumps, warlocks and titans should have no troubles.

Use the slopes of the rocks to throw yourself upwards with momentum.

100 Mobility with Stomp335

No sword ammo and no  stasis grenades, which would obviously make that high jump MUCH easier, so this is probably the hardest way to do this section. Defs use these to get you through, only 2 hard-ish jumps and youre free to get through the whole section.

THIS IS ME ASKING FOR YOUR THOUGHTS NOT ME SAYING IT'S 100% WHAT I THINK IT IS

&amp;#x200B;

 just wanted to scream that first okie

&amp;#x200B;

Alright bois so I'm the dude a while back who made the super long post about my studying the Pyramid Ships and what I believe the truth about them was. As a result of the time spent observing the Pyramid architecture in particular I am really confident in saying that I know it inside out. 

&amp;#x200B;

When BL came out I was extremely disappointed with the lack of Pyramid involvement in the campaign, the fact that the actual Pyramid interior was a copy and paste of the end of the Moon Pyramid, and the fact that the majority of the Pyramid architecture was relegated to ""simulations."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, the new architecture did have new engravings in the Exo Challenge missions, and the cruxes SPECIFICALLY have completely new whisper voice lines/creepiness (I recorded them for myself but I can upload them if you are interested.)

&amp;#x200B;

Long. Story. Short.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing the week 2 Exo Challenge, and I noticed at the end there was a style of engraving that didn't match the typical style of the place at all. I saw a rectangle going down, with a smaller one connected above. This exact engraving can be found on pillars in at least the second and third Exo Challenge, with the second challenge having that engraving as the outline for the entrance to the main complex (the part where you run in the tunnel with the disappearing floor, the pads form that symbol.) 

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing a third line separating the larger rectangle into two parts, in my mind this engraving represented one thing. A double edged blade with a thin rectangular hilt. I have to make this clear, this is going to be purely up to how you see it. Friends wise 3 agree with me and 2 are undecided, so I'm not just expecting everyone to see what I see.

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought it was a sword, and immediately a connection was made between this ""sword"" and the Sword Logic. This made sense to me, as although I do not believe the Pyramids to be the actual Darkness, I do believe they are allied with it, and so follow some form of the Sword Logic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at this thing which I think is a sword, and I'm just thinking. What struck me at the time was the ""handle"" and the ""blade."" The handle/hilt is thin and rectangular. The blade is double edged, but one side is wider than the other, the hilt not being in the direct centre of the blade as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately I thought of the Winnower’s blade, because I remember it being somewhat blocky as well. I pull up a picture and the similarities are extremely striking. Two double edged blades with one edge wider than the other, a third ""edge"" coming in from the side. I drew some lines in the slide to show you what I mean. At this stage, it’s really up to you as to whether or not you see the resemblance. I will argue with anyone that this is a sword, but if you think that it isn’t any sword in particular well, that’s all good.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the first part of this, which was just showing you what I found. The next is what this could mean if I'm right.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright for this part, assume that this engraving is in fact, a sword, and more that, the Winnower’s sword. What would this mean? I’ll tell you what it would mean for the Pyramids, the Winnower, and the deeper lore.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Pyramids this changes absolutely nothing about my beliefs surrounding them. In regards to the sword, it doesn’t really matter. Like I said, I don’t believe the Pyramids are the Darkness. I am adamant that the statue of the veiled lady is the Gardener, and the Pyramids who perhaps used to worship her,  are now allied with the Winnower, not actually him. It is very clear from what those inside the Pyramids have said that they do believe in some form of the Sword Logic, so seeing a sword is really not that surprising. If the sword is the sword I think it is, then this is a symbol of the logic that the Pyramids follow, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Winnower this would actually be extremely significant. If this is actually a representation of the sword shown in the concept art, then that concept art is what the Winnower to some extent looks like. Yes, I get it, he’s the Formless One, but if the Gardener has a physical form, then at some stage he must have had one as well. If you want proof about what the Gardener looks like I explain it all in my OG post and the video here: [https://youtu.be/xS4M-CIZBWQ](https://youtu.be/xS4M-CIZBWQ)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally for the lore, this is the really conspiracy theorist stuff. We're bringing out the Nastareth bois!  I would like to state that I am very aware that there are some people who groaned upon seeing that word, and to those of you I am sorry. But this is simply what I’ve found.

&amp;#x200B;

Sylok, THE DEFILED. Oh yeah, our buddy Silly Sylok. Sylok was a Taken Knight in the Prison of Elders and was experimented on by the Awoken. The Taken are pretty much braindead, and the only real stimulation that got some brain activity was pain, so they pretty much tortured him. He absolutely loved the pain, and one of the lines he said was “Blessed is the Nastareth.” ([https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/sylok-the-defiled?highlight=Nastareth](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/sylok-the-defiled?highlight=Nastareth)) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that is the only time in the lore that this word has been used, and no one has any idea what it means. If you google it you’ll find nothing, BUT, while I was searching the word Nastareth, I was met with the word Nastara.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there’s the name Nastara which means wild rose, don’t get mixed up with that. I believe it’s from Hindi, or one of the Indian languages, but a Nastara is a lancet. The plural of the word is nastaras/nashtaras btw so sounds very similar. Anyway a Nastara is a lancet, and a lancet, is a broad, double edged blade often used for surgery. What does any of this have to do with the Winnower you might ask? Ok this is where the waffle begins. The Winnower is the destroyer of life, but theoretically not all life. Only the life that he believes deserves it. As a result of this he is the pruner of the garden, the dude who separates the wheat from the chaff. He reaches in, cuts out a chunk of life, but is careful to only take what is needed. Sounds like the guy could use a lancet if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So why mention the Nastareth? Because honestly, at this stage what could it mean? It’s a word that’s dead in the water, most people not knowing it exists, and those who do know it having forgotten about its place in the big scheme of things. I’ve found a possible inspiration for the word, and that inspiration is a blade that fits with how the Winnower sees his work. So my friends, why not give the sword of the sword logic a name? Why not say the Winnower wields the Nastareth?

&amp;#x200B;

That is the conclusion to this discovery. I said it before and I’ll say it again, this isn’t me announcing that this is the 100% Winnower’s sword. Truth be told, even if I'm right, it's not too big a deal in my eyes, although it would tear down the notion that the veiled lady is the Winnower.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friends I will let you decide what this is. Is this as one of my friends put it, a hole in the wall? Do you think it’s a sword? Do you think it’s the Winnower’s sword. If you think it is, what do you think this means? Let me know.

raidsecrets,Secret symbol near Future War Cult room or just texture?,"Hey guys. I was walking around in the tower being a little sleep derived and stopped next to the future war cult, because i remembered that there was a new lore piece with the FWC. I then stopped right at the entrance and turned around to see Saint-14. I then saw [this little symbol scatched](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ewofb3IW8AIC2z6?format=jpg&amp;name=large) into the door frame that i wasn't able to find elsewhere.

My thoughts:

- My first thought was that it resembled one of the Ada-1 forges, but the forges have the [""wings"" lower than i initially remembered](https://www.vgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/destiny-2-izanami-forge-guide-2.jpg)

- After thinking a little bit i thought about Savathûn and how her ""viral song"" is going around and that through those the cabal started carving runes and summoned Xivu Arath (correct me if i'm wrong please). The carving is similar to [that one rune on the crown of sorrows.](https://i.imgur.com/hAAnCPU.jpeg) We also know that the viral tune is now affecting more and more people around the tower.

- Maybe its just a texture glitch. Points against it being a coincidence: Bungie wants to hide clues as well as they can because data mining is in full effect after each update. Best way to hide it is to put it in textures that can be mirrored and still make sense (see Five Nights At Freddies). If it was a coincidence, why is it so obviously in eye sight (tho you can argument that things like these typically aren't seen because they are not right at player level).


So what do you guys think? Just a random texture glitch or something Bungie put in on purpose? 

Also sorry if this was found already. I googled ""symbols around future war cult"" and saw no posts on this.",1615932731,2021-03-16 18:12:11

raidsecrets,The Sparrow Wall Climb Method,"Hey guys,

I don't usually post my videos here anymore, but I thought this one might be particularly helpful.

I've found a way to use a Sparrow to climb most walls, and the best part is it can be done on any class...even Hunters.

---

What you'll need:

1.  Exotic Sparrow (roll capabilities)
2.  Any Class
3.  A wall. (preferably straight, but it can work on slanty ones too.)

---

How to do it:

1.  Stand next to a wall.
2.  Jump, spawn sparrow.
3.  Roll towards the wall until you're upside-down.
4.  Boost twice in the opposite direction from the wall.

This will cause your Sparrow to clip into the wall and hold it upside down for a short time.  Because of this, your Guardian will fall off the Sparrow and land back up on top of it.

This means that you will get your jumps back so you can repeat the process.

raidsecrets,Possible puzzle and findings about stars,"Hello.  
First I wanna make clear something: I don't intend to copy, be rude or disturb anybody. I am here to show my findings about a post from weeks ago. I am just a overthinker and might get things to far. If you don't intend to listen to what I have to say. Please, don't hate me for thinking something wrong. Thank you!

Ok, let's get started. So, some days ago, I found something about the limits in the prophecy dungeon's last part (the nine). It tends to go more towards the neon circle. (maybe you already known that)

Visual representation (sort of):[https://imgur.com/a/BmEwQki](https://imgur.com/a/BmEwQki)

If you look in the circle from behind it you can see the ""stars"" of the nine near her. Maybe it is meant to be like that, I mean, maybe we have to see something. I think we have to connect the dots/stars to form a constellation out of it which brings me up to the 2nd found.

The nine ""stars"": [https://imgur.com/a/O9o6AiL](https://imgur.com/a/O9o6AiL)

There are more constellations found in the Last Wish raid. Maybe you already seen my post about the stars we found in the Shuro Chi.

Post (if you didn't):

Kali also has 1 gazebo like that one:  [https://imgur.com/a/tcXRJEH](https://imgur.com/a/tcXRJEH)

The idea is. Bungie has some stars/constellation related ornaments/shells/projections/stuff. Maybe they added it just to remind us about those things.

Also, it seems a bit suspect.. why they added a different pattern for every single gazebo in the LW if there was nothing? Couldn't they copy past it.. also.. why are the stars so bright?

Another ""strange"" set of stars was found in the new cutscene that was leaked before. I also made a post about that, but I think there is nothing at all. Maybe just a reminder.

Maybe we can get the ""constellations"" aligned to the Last Wish symbols. Maybe we can found a code out of it. Maybe there is nothing at all.

[https://youtu.be/YmBTQC50PkI](https://youtu.be/YmBTQC50PkI)

Just take the closer wrong warp, and sword fly to the left of the bubble. Then it's just like it was in the [Quantum Finisher days](https://youtu.be/WVPNaw5AlYI).

Since there's no sparrow needed, you can do this from the raid. See [here](https://youtu.be/2DHRrss9r9U?t=224) for how to get there.

This means for a few more days, it may be possible to do [with 11 people](https://youtu.be/mti73xFUnH0). One must be sacrificed to allow for the [wrong warp](https://youtu.be/pum2El-fO8o) to work. Since Dreaming City patrol from the raid is not matchmade, I believe it'll bypass the 9 player limit for most patrol zones.

If you're confident in your sword flying, perhaps head over to the [\#glitches](https://discord.gg/FHbydn67) channel on the Raid Secrets discord, and we'll see about organizing the 12 man before that part of the glitch is patched.

If your behind the ship looking at the thrusters, the 1st is located on top of the Left Thruster.

The 2nd reachable via the opposite side. There is a metal frame thing going from the side of the ship to the roof. It requires the use of Thundercrash or perhaps blade barrage to push through the height barrier. Once up there, you will eventually be able to scan the scannable after a few attempts as you keep res’ing up there.

There is 2 more clusters of these scannables but they are definitely beyond reach.

Do they do anything?

Nope..

But it’s cool to be able to say you’ve scanned them :)

And it's not just the lament being anti barrier, I tried it on a non-frozen wyvern, doesn't work. Maybe other weapons work too, it's just the lament deals a lot of dmg in one hit so in the chaos of the battle it was clearly visible, the wyvern's health decreasing.

*My original post*
&gt;Had something weird happen to me the other night, never had it occur before so wanted to share it here.

Normally, the boss encounter is split between killing the big boy with orange shields and the transcendent hydra that hides toward the player on the right or left of the map. You kill those two, boom, you're done.


I managed to kill the big boy in one phase (curaiss thundercrash + volotile induction) but had to do all 3 phases to kill the transcendent. 1st phase damage on transcendent is as normal he teleports away after taking damage and ads spawn in. Cleared ads and the transcendent rememerges, but this time with another orange shielded hydra, a model I've never seen, shorter and stumpier than the original big boy hydra, but still larger than the transcendent. On the third phase, we killed the stumpy orange hydra and no shit, 9/10 wyverns spawned simultaneously. I died here, up close with my lament on the transcendent, didn't anticipate getting cluster fucked by so many wyverns. Whilst down my team failed to killed them quick enough, they despawned and the strike ended as it would normally.


Has this happened to anyone else?

raidsecrets,"Savathûn's Song - I think Eris is either lying to us or misinformed, and we've been hearing it for a lot longer than a year","The Whisper is one of my favorite bits of Destiny content ever. I probably did that mission 50 times, taking friends through the various versions. I solo'd it a bunch of weeks for chest progress and catalysts. I listened to the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7o6Y3Tw5Zg) at work like a weirdo. This mission debuted with Warmind, and is generally though of as us proving ourselves to (or conquering) Xol in order to earn him as a weapon, in the Whisper of the Worm.

Last season, most of the focus was on Deep Stone Crypt, Beyond Light brought us new musical themes, and the seasonal stuff like wrathborn hunts fell a bit by the wayside. But something stuck out to me in the Hawkmoon/Harbinger mission. [Take a listen, and pay attention to 1m24s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRbPxd5dHxQ). We've heard that [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7o6Y3Tw5Zg&amp;t=668s). But I always thought of ""A Thousand Wings"" (Whisper music) to be ""Xol's theme"". Interestingly though, take a listen to the actual [boss fight music against Xol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhUh-mnKEMw). Okay, it's a banger, but this motif *is nowhere to be found*.

This also shows up in Shadowkeep, namely in Garden of Salvation vs. the [Consecrated Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp4PkKiqlqk) (both phases). It plays loud and clear, plain as day at 1m50s. What we have been *told* is Savathûn's Song also plays here - it even opens the first phase, and it also plays in the Consecrated Mind boss fight music. This particular theme doesn't appear there, and I think that will be important, but I don't yet know how. Savathûn and ""the darkness"" are certainly intertwined, but are *not the same thing*, and I think we could argue that the Beyond Light theme may actually be our first proper theme for ""the darkness"".

Now this season it is *FUCKING EVERYWHERE*. Hangar action music in the [Presage mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcdYhKmecVM) (first debut at 1m9s - however, note it doesn't appear in the boss fight music against the Locus of Communion), and it plays in the music when you are in The Pit lost sector in the EDZ as part of the Contender's Ascent IV quest (from week 4 of the current season). This motif has more appearances now than even the Traveler's theme (I think most recently shows up in Heretical Omen from Pit of Heresy) or the guardians' theme (shows up briefly in the boss fight vs. Taniks in DSC).

Today I stumbled across the music from the intro mission to the [Forsaken campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCkZy4Dwr0). Skip ahead to Action 2 and take a listen. We now know the events of Forsaken to have been orchestrated by Savathûn, enacted via Riven. It's worth nothing that, to my knowledge, this motif does not show up anywhere in the Last Wish raid. But you know what? We have actually run in to it before. Guess where.

#[Savathûn's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMlLKnbACII)

This kinda feels like Bungie has been screaming at us for the last year to try to get us to pay attention to this; it's starting to become ridiculous as we draw closer to The Witch Queen, and I would expect it to keep cropping up.

I don't think we've been hearing ""Savathûn's Song"" since Shadowkeep. I think we've been hearing it since the Red War and Eris either doesn't know or is misdirecting us re:Shadowkeep theme.

This has some disturbing implications. It kind of re-contextualizes the Whisper of the Worm mission. It's less us ""earning"" the power to wield Xol, and more him being fed to us by Savathûn. I think it may also tie everything together about why we are able to visit the Glykon, considering the Crown of Sorrow is onboard, a direct link to Savathûn, and represents her control... and I'm sure there are other implications I have missed.",1615428183,2021-03-10 21:03:03

raidsecrets,Lore book Marasenna corresponds with various seasons and DLC's from the past/future.,"Bit of Spinfoil speculation: The lore book Marasenna almost perfectly corresponds to a season that was released either currently or previously, at least as far as I can see. I saw the lore entry Katabasis (21) and my mind went right to Presage and the guardian Katabasis we find dead at the end. If that lore entry corresponds to season of the Chosen, then we can work backwards to find what other entries relate to each season:

Katabasis the guardian/""moving downhill""==Chosen, it uses his name unclear about the definition

Imponent I-V ""One who imposes a rule""==Hunt, not clear perhaps the relationship between Crow and Spider?

Heresiology ""The study of heresy""==Beyond Light (which is why there is only 1 entry), we begin wielding the darkness and studying it, IE heresy against the light.

Fideicide I-III ""One who breaks trust""==Arrivals, the darkness arrives and attempts to shatter our faith in the light.

Ecstasiate I-III ""to enter a state of ecstasy""==Worthy, not clear

Cosmogyre I-IV ""the universe is spinning""==Dawn, not clear

Brephos I-III ""a newborn child""==Undying, not clear

Archiloquy ""The start of a speech""==Shadowkeep, the first DLC after Forsaken perhaps?

&amp;#x200B;

Then going the other way from katabasis we have:

Nigh I-II ""soon, nearby""==next season

Palingenesis I-III ""to be reborn, bring back tradition""==season after next

Revanche ""moving to reclaim lost territory""==Witch Queen

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have exact relations for each word to the season it corresponds to, but I'm not a linguist or very bright. We can clearly see there are 'onedrop' lore entries for when a DLC drops and a set of lore for a given season. I might be giving bungie a bit too much credit to think that far ahead, but the coincidence is certainly there at least.",1615403379,2021-03-10 14:09:39

**Why I am saying that is an easter egg or a puzzle?**  
Early this season, Bungie released the Projections bundle. Witch had the exact same theme: **stars and symbols among the stars.**

Maybe that was a ""preview"" or a ""teaser"" for this cutscene, maybe the stars seen in the cutscene are the stars in the bundle. I didn't spend so much time to line the stars.  


**a puzzle?**

It maybe corelates to the post I made and stars from Shuro Chi in a way. I looked at one group of stars and it didn't look like any projection from the bundle, so they might have a different meaning. How ever, same we thought about DSC constellation on the reddit post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep\_stone\_crypt\_cutscene\_constellation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep_stone_crypt_cutscene_constellation/)  


I will not spend time trying to solve or complete this puzzle/easter egg. Why? Because I know no one cares about that. Just a theory of my overthinking.",1615391745,2021-03-10 10:55:45
raidsecrets,Another Ghost has died?,"So I was looking at my lore tabs and noticed I was missing a ""Ghost Stories"" 22/23. However, I was 100% I got them all, a quick google search shows that, [yes there are only 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMBWiP2p4MA&amp;ab_channel=Esoterickk); and the Ghost in the Presage mission doesn't count towards that. 

So...who died? Or is this just a bug? I have a screenshot before Beyond Light with all the Lore done so I didn't miss one.",1615390528,2021-03-10 10:35:28
raidsecrets,Season of The Dark Future?,"I know this theory is kinda far out, but the armor sets that they teased for Witch Queen got me thinking. What if in the Witch Queen or the seasons after we actually visit the Dark Future from Elizabeth's original timeline? As a way to see Savathuns strategies and how she brought the city to its knees. And then use that knowledge to better plan counters. I mentioned the armor because the Symbology and visual language of the new concept art reminds me of Braytech and Elsie's symbol.

( https:// imgur.com/a/aH5E5Zb )

This may be a bit of a reach, but I think its possible we could see something involving Elsie's timeline more heavily down the road. I think we could see a darker version of braytech armor that was salvaged from the ruins of The Bombardment. Or something a little less spinfoily maybe we will see Ada-1 and Elsie collaborating to make Stasis weapons and armor. Would love to hear your thoughts.

There a pipes at each boiler room entrance you can sit on and wait for the locus to come to you, sit on these pipes and jump in and out of the entrance to get his attention, then use felwinters and xenophage for damage with a stasis super for ads.

This is a side note that you can take with a grain of salt, when ""Presage"" came out on the first day and i got to the end room and used the emote on the lower doors of the room and found that it had more visibility that i could ""see"", so i concluded that they were doors that would open later.

We timed it out, joined the other fireteam during the launch and were able to join together. However we can't get past the ""Searching for Guardians"" screen. We can all see each other and it says 5/3 Guardians. It fades to black as if the strike is going to load, only to reload the ""Searching For Guardians Screen"" after a few seconds, fades to black and reloads the ""Searching for Guardians Screen.""

[player 1] will promote [player 3] to fireteam leader, and then [player 1] and [player 2] will leave the fireteam, splitting the group into 2 and 10.

[player 1] will now join on [player 2], and then [player 2] will promote [player 1] to fireteam leader. This is the most important step, and what caused our runs to succeed.

[player 1] will now get ready to launch the activity, and [player 3] will get ready to join on [player 2], bringing the whole group of 10. [Player 1] will now launch and call for [player 3] to join up a little before the launch timer reaches 2 seconds.

If done right, [player 1] should see “someone is joining your fireteam” around 0 seconds.

If not, [player 1] and [player 2] change characters or leave the fireteam and try again.

raidsecrets,The Nova Armor sets are 99.99% related to the DSC,"So let's start with a few other theories and then we'll get right to the proof:



So first off, the armor sets have the three most important alchemical elements written on them. If we look at how Clovis Bray treated his work in the DSC we can clearly observe that he was comparing his work to alchemy. Hell, he didn't even invent the term ""Alkahest"" it's just a mythical substance from, you've guessed it, Alchemy.




Then, if we look at the designs of these sets, it clearly looks like they are some kind of research or hazmat suits. The Titan one has some kind of vials near the shoulders and we can see some kind of rubber boots (On Hunter) and rubber undersuit (on every set)





And now, for  the actual proof, it consists of one single gun: Trustee. You can see that Trustee has some very similar symbols. Actually, most of the DSC weapons have these symbols, except the Succesion and Heritage.

raidsecrets,The Witch Queen Armour Symbols.,"It's already going around that the armour is themed around alchemy, elements and minerals ect...


with the hunter being mercury for mind, the titan being salt for body and the warlock being sulphur for the soul. (this fact was brought to my attention because of u/Hip_Hop_Kido)

&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to see if we could identify the meaning behind all the symbols... There's a lot of interesting references on the armour.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: The Star that appears on all three armour could be a reference to the seven pointed heptagram. ""In alchemy, a seven-sided star can refer to the seven planets which were known to early alchemists, and also, the seven alchemical substances: fire, water, air, earth, sulphur, salt and mercury.""


&amp;nbsp;


Hunter: 

&amp;nbsp;

Collar has triangles which mean Water ""🜄"" and Air ""🜁"", Mother and Son or Swords and Cups.


To the left and Right of the Collar is the atomic number (left) and atomic weight (right) for mercury.



On the boot is the Symbol for Mercury in alchemy ""☿"".


then what could be the seasonal symbol, a whirlpool? a flower? fish eating bait?

Then the symbol for Calcium Oxide which alchemists called ""Quick Lime"" ""🝁""


&amp;nbsp;



Titan:


&amp;nbsp;

On their chest is the symbol of salt ""🜔"" combined with another symbol.  A circle with two dots. The two dotted circle appears three times unmerged with salt, once on the gauntlet, once on the mark and once on the boot.


(Edit: This Circle with two dots is the symbol for sea salt, thanks for u/KittenAlfredo for pointing that out).


The shoulders have Na and Cl, the atomic symbols for Sodium and Chlorine which become Sodium Chloride aka salt.



The very top of the titan mark has 17 on the top left and 35.453 on the right which is the atomic number and atomic weight of Chlorine.


Lower down the mark are some symbols i cound't figure out followed by the symbol for bizmuth ""🜘"" and the symbol for crucible ""🝨"" merged together.


&amp;nbsp;


Warlock:


&amp;nbsp;


The faceplate shape is that of the symbol for air ""🜁"".


The chest has the strange symbol that appears on all three armours. It's surrounded by the symbol for philosophers sulphur ""🜎"", the atomic symbol for sulphur ""S"", The alchemic symbol for vinegar ""🜊"" and upside-down and incomplete version of the symbol for black sulphur ""🜏"" which may mean something else.



On the hips is the atomic number and atomic weight of sulphur. 16 and 32.066.



At the very bottom of the fabric is a completed and actual version for black sulphur ""🜏"". above it appear to be incomplete versions of the alchemic symbol for Phosphorus.",1614786090,2021-03-03 10:41:30

raidsecrets,Adding in new Butterflies to the game? Minigame etc,"Currently we have 4 different Butterflies in the game as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/m2LVUxA.png).  And when used on other players it actually gives them some cool buffs. 

I'd like to propose the idea of adding in more Butterflies to the game on the same scale as Implings — and perhaps even bringing out a Puro-Puro game for them as well. 

You could add Butterflies up to 85-90 Hunter that give run energy and special attack onto other places.  A Butterfly that grants Special Attack to others would be worth a lot of money.  If you are a tank or a support role and your main DPS missed his DWH spec, you could use this Butterfly on him and he can try again (all you have to do is use it on them, no trade screen).  It has uses for sure and would be at a cost — or be rare if you're an ironman (think d imp).

However, this is only one example at the higher end.  There's so much more you can do with Butterfly perks.  You could easily add in 8-10 more different variants. 

I know in RS3 you can barehand catch Butterflies for a bit of Agility XP too, however, we could simply make the rates much smaller in OSRS. 

Just wanted to propose a small idea that I think could add more incentive to the Hunter skill. Butterfly perks as a whole are quite interesting and would play a great role in this economy and bossing meta.

This way, if the team fails to join, only two players will have to swap characters, and they can rejoin each other faster. If the team joins before the mission launches, simply have the two back out after promoting the joining fire team leader to host.

I didn’t have any of the new exotic chests, so I was hoping to pick it up on all of my characters.

When I got to my Hunter, he had like 8 or 9 umbral engrams (they still kinda do drop frequently), and in the course of doing the LS, I eventually ended up having 10 in my inventory - full.

At the end of my third run (I had gotten the chest on my third run on my other two characters, so I was expecting it at the end of the third on my Hunter), I got an exotic engram. I figured that since I had a full engram inventory, it didn’t decrypt immediately and I knew it was gonna be in my postmaster.

So I go to the HELM to decrypt some umbrals to make space, and as expected, the exotic engram was in my postmaster.

I was afraid that maybe, because I wasn’t inside the LS, I was gonna end up with a random exotic I already owned.

But when I picked it up from the postmaster, it decrypted into the exotic arms that are available in the 1330 master LS. I hadn’t yet gotten them in my collection, so there was no way it would decrypt from a regular exotic engram, as far as I know.

I figure that the game knows that it’s an exotic engram from a LS, but it doesn’t distinguish from legend or master. So when you decrypt it, you have a chance of it decrypting into the exotic from the other LS.

I did go back to the Bunker to try and get the chest, and I got it on my second run. It decrypted immediately cause my engram inventory was no longer full.",1614441381,2021-02-27 10:56:21

raidsecrets,12 Man Raids (or other activities),"Big thanks to Scrub for finding this.

Split into 2 teams with the leaders as physically close to each other as possible (for lower ping), one with 5 people and one with 7 people.

Have the 5 person team launch into the raid. Have them call out when the countdown hits 2 (you may need to change that number based on how fast the connection is). The leader of the 7 person team needs to join the 5 person team, wait on the screen that says ""bring fireteam with you"", and when the leader of the 5 person team calls out you click ""bring with me"". If done correctly you will get into the raid with 12 people, but it is really tight timing.

If you end up with a 12 person fireteam in orbit, you need to join a little later. If you end up with 5 people in the raid you need to join a little earlier.

Good luck, it is really fun!

Note: Make sure the launching fireteam has 1 slot open for every joining fireteam, staying within the original player limit. For example, for nightfalls, have 2 people in the fireteam. Have another fireteam with 10 people. I have only tested it with raids, but I think it works in other places as well.

raidsecrets,I think the witch queen armor stand for the three darkness subclasses!,"Everyone probably has seen the newly revealed ""The Witch Queen"" expansion armor.

Well i did some research, and i found some things worth noting.

First of all the middle guardian armor references Sodium Chloride or salt,

The right represents Sulfur and we can also see that it has the atomic number of sulfur.

The left one has number 80 the atomic number of mercury.

What many of you probably don't know is that alchemist start their journey at their body(Salt) to purified it to true salt with the other elements. They are btw called elements.

Now the salt element is explained as follows:

salt stands for condensation, crystallization, and the underlying essence of a body.

Kinda sounds like stasis to me, us starting out on this darkness adventure unlocking the darkness within ,becoming literally frozen and then breaking the ice to unlock our darkness powers. In alchemy they also believe you have to break down your body to get to the core because your body or salt as they believe is made out of mercury and sulfur. If this is indeed right this could mean the others are upcoming darkness subclasses

The other 2 are explained as follows:

\-(mercury) mercury was thought to transcend life/death and heaven/earth.

\-(sulfur) Sulfur was used to denote the expansive force, evaporation, and dissolution

I think the mercury one will be the next subclass because mercury is all about the mind like Savathun she sought to transcend life and death with Nokris and in the presage mission we hear the voices of the dead. The prophecy dungeon has a place called heaven and hell which reminds me of the heaven and earth.

And also what does a witch do she makes poison,many us expect a poisonous subclass in the witch queen expansion. What is mercury? Very poisonous.

And then in lightfall we will probably unlock the sulfur subclass, the core darkness one , what does the darkness do? it expands, evaporates and dissolves the light.

Also about salt being stasis, look at how beyond light focused on exo's ,literal bodies made out and vex milk and they later added darkness(clarity) but still the exo bodies do have certain malfunctions and degrade over time. Of course if we follow the alchemical explanation that is very logical because the body (pure) salt is build out of mercury (mind) and sulfur(spirit) what is it that the exo's have problems with, their memory mind and their spirit/personalities that change. Which aren't like they should b hence the malfunction.

&amp;#x200B;

[ErrantStriker](https://www.reddit.com/user/ErrantStriker/) also pointed out that the seven pointed star and/or the seven armed galaxy   could be referring to the 7 planetary metals in alchemy and considering that 6 of the 7 planets mentioned are, or at least where, in game, wether directly or via their moons, leaving Venus as the only one that isn't in game (yet).

Yeah, 1 of Season of Dawns Psion Flayer Sundial Bosses is hidden in plain sight in Season of the Chosen. 
Ozletc is one of the Psions behind a barrier on the 2nd Objective of Battleground Oracle. 
Looking into the room doesn’t show any names, even if scoped in. When the objective is complete, she runs near the barrier, disappears and then the barrier itself comes down. 
You can only see her name from inside the room before the objective is complete.


The description of Battleground Oracle reads, 
A group of former Red Legion Psions are communing with Vex prediction engines deep within Nessus. They seek to gain tactical insights by analysing simulations of future events against their own psychic foresight. Eliminate this threat before they can deliver their intelligence to Empress Caiatl.
Ozletc does get away..

If you’d like to check out my video about it, you can find it [here](https://youtu.be/Pk1bICZsFPM).

Now for a Text Tutorial.

With a bit of Sword Flying, Dawnblading, Salvation Gripping or Stasis Nade Platforming, you can get over the top of the barrier and drop inside the room. 
Its that simple. 
The 2 small Psions have no name but Ozletc does, and you can kill them all.
Ozletc has a big health pool like any boss. May be the same size health pool as in Season of Dawn.
Either way, they all stand there and don’t fight back but Ozletc may stomp you.
Have fun and we’ll see if Empress Caiatl actually does anything with that intel..

So, while the high-level experience remains the same, you should expect the raid team to have a few tricks up their sleeves when **you tackle the depths of Venus** this summer.

raidsecrets,Possible braille on Witch Queen Nova armor,"With the release of bungie's dev blog about Witch Queen they added a picture of a new armor set named Nova. (I don't know if that's it's actual name or a code name.) If you look at the armors' chest pieces you can see a bunch of dots arranged in patterns that strongly remind me of braille, with the titan having the most and easiest to see. Thought it was worth mentioning since bungie likes hiding things.

I'm at work but when I get time I'll try and see if I can translate it.

raidsecrets,Before you leave the glitched Fallen S.A.B.E.R. strike...,"As you know, the Fallen S.A.B.E.R. stike is glitched: once you complete the strike, your team wipes and you will repeat the mission all over. BUT, you will be stuck at the beginning, with the warsat no longer dropping (without the warsat, there's no way to continue the strike).

I think that everyone already acknoledged that the bugged part of the strike also counts as part of the strike. You will be stuck with your own instance of the cosmodrome, with randoms joining and leaving all the time. You can make use of this and complete bounties and/or other quests without teammates stealing your kills. You can use the Velles Labyritnh to farm enemies for catalysts.

Yesterday, I got stuck in this instance, and I realised that I could complete the Salvager's salvo quest. Just use Fighting lion!

TL;DR: The bugged instance of the Fallen saber can be used to complete strike objectives

raidsecrets,Morgeth Forever Fight Raid Challenge Cheese,"Building on the recent posts by u/fellowgamer837 and u/NonManifest, and the video from u/pastuleo23 a while back about damaging immune enemies with Stasis, me and some of my clan decided to do a bit of testing to see how much damage you could do to Morgeth using Lament and Stasis without killing him. This would allow the encounter to be started for a very quick kill and provide an easy way of getting the Forever Fight challenge (doing the encounter without killing the ogres that spawn).

Video of us starting the encounter and getting the kill here: [https://youtu.be/_ABcDNjLLXg](https://youtu.be/_ABcDNjLLXg)

A revved Lament heavy attack on Morgeth when he's frozen does 24,858 damage. My initial estimate based on measuring Morgeth's health bar turned out to be a bit off and we killed him the first time. We tried to do one attack fewer than that run but our numbers turned out to be a bit off because we also killed him the second time. 

I estimate that Morgeth has somewhere around a little over 3,604,410, because when we finally did it we did 145 revved heavy Lament attacks, which was enough to leave him with only a tiny bit of health. You could possibly do 146 attacks, but 147 was too many

After 145 attacks we started the encounter, hit him with Stasis again and did a few more sword hits. We rotated in and out for ammo as necessary.

raidsecrets,"Possible ""Escape the Ship"" ending in Presage","Now, this is a shot in the dark and I've been holding on to this for the last week to see if anything new comes up, but seeing as nobody's mentioned this, here goes nothing.

To start, we should have our expectations straight. Presage is obviously a puzzle mission with much higher polish and attention to detail than previous missions like it, so brushing things off as coincidence or existing ""for no reason""/etc should be the last conclusion we come to. 

In this mission, we have two main types of physical doorways we use to navigate the mission: classic Cabal ship doors and maintenance hatches. The first point of curiosity came when my s/o and I did the mission for the first time- in the first puzzle room, there is a second Spore that allows you to go back through the spore door back to where you started, up on the platform above the second wave of Screebs. Curious, because you can entirely ignore this spore when going for solo flawless, and there's a maintenance hatch next to it that matches 3 maintenance hatches used to progress through the room.

When we did the mission the second time to get our random rolled Dead Man's, she noticed you could open the giant door at the beginning of the mission from the inside. Looking out, and seeing your ship out there? It looks just like the end of a story mission where we have to run to your ship, like we did in Taken King and Beyond Light. On top of that, the Spore door in the same room can be accessed from both sides. That makes 2 spore doors that can be accessed from both sides, so that can't not mean something...right?

The last piece of evidence I have towards this idea is the only other Maintenance hatch I've found so far that seems out of place; at the very end of the Hangar segment, by the ship you have to jump on. Considering there's a Crown of Sorrows room underneath the bridge of the ship, it may connect back somehow. 

We still have to get Katabasis's Ghost. We may end up having to just grab it and run..",1614061981,2021-02-23 01:33:01

raidsecrets,Savathun's Song not included in... Savathun's Song,"I recently ran through Garden of Salvation and I noticed Savathun's Song was everywhere during the boss encounters music. [During one of your confrontations with The Consecrated Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft3kZcoTjzg), [as well as the fight against The Sanctified Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCae_Cj9aTM), the full, complete 8 notes pop their ugly head in our legendary battles with the Vex (Both found at the beginning of each of their respective Phase 1s, as well as later in the songs themselves). After this horrifying revelation, I thought to myself: What about that one strike on Titan? The one where Taeko-3 dies? Wasn't that shrieker's name Savathun's Song? Is Savathun's Song in [Savathun's Song?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjDFqEp5bac) 

With my semi-trained ear I couldn't find it anywhere in the song. It's sad, sure, but I'm not super surprised that this motif isn't found in one of the vanilla strikes, as that would've taken a considerable larger amount of foresight and planning, and I'm assuming planning 2 years in advance still takes a lot of effort.

However, I'm not entirely convinced that there isn't ANY reference to Savathun's Song. I mean the strike's boss's name is ""Savathun's Song,"" that in of itself is a reference to the approaching Savathun. I also know there are ways to hint at a melody without playing the actual melody. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K-9Ekzc2A) video from a Youtuber I enjoy watching points out (specifically from 13:07 to 14:11, but I recommend watching the entire thing) that one can take a handful of notes (Let's say, D F G E C E F B for example, because those are the notes in Savathun's Song) and play them backwards, or in a different key, or any other combination of modifications. My issue is that I don't have the sheet music to any of these arrangements, because if I did I might be able to do it, but I don't think any of the songs we would need/want to analyze have published sheet music, and I know that by the time that I transpose it myself the Witch Queen AND Lightfall will already be released because most of my musical experience comes vicariously through that Youtuber I cited and I would probably give up before I ever do anything. Hence why I'm asking y'all for help. Where else can we find Savathun's Song? Other than the places that already have been mentioned (Namely all of the instances found in [Byf's video from last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP28-xqkH1w), and from the Garden of Salvation), is there any other places that this lil' dity?

I do want to add something before I post, a theory/very educated guess: Savathun's Song is in the Garden of Salvation because Salvation was trying to corrupt us. I think this is already well established, as we know Lisbon-13 turned and embraced his Shadow-clone, found [here](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/legacys-oath-plate?highlight=Lisbon-13), and I assume that Savathun was trying to do the same to us.

2. The prompt says ""steal"" instead of ""take"" or ""collect"" like we usually see. 
3. The room has doors that can open, as seen with the doors that have red lights. 

I theorize that on thr master difficulty when we steal the weapon, the dead guardian will wake up and will be the final boss on Master difficulty, similar to the final mission during Rise of Iron.",1614022939,2021-02-22 14:42:19

The definition of the word 'presage' is ""to be a sign or warning that something (usually something bad) will happen"", or it can be used as a noun. In this case quite literally, the mission is a presage for... what, we're not quite sure, but it's very interesting that the mission's name marks it as an omen.

It may be presaging the arrival of The Darkness, or I believe a new, Darkness-adjacent hivemind species, as indicated by the buff we receive in the quest, Egregore Link, which seems to ""attune"" us so we can pass through what are seemingly similar to barriers of psychic energy. An egregore is more than just a non-physical entity, it's a collective projection of thought and energy, which may be the creatures the Darkness has bonded with as a physical extension of its power.",1613897518,2021-02-21 03:51:58

raidsecrets,"How to do 1,500,000 Damage with Thundercrash [Video Included]","**TLDR**: [1,500,000 Damage Thundercrash - Destiny 2 Season of the Chosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-3DhYsGYN4) (Philly was just there to hold the boss in place, he did nothing else, aka ""The Fluffer"")

This method requires 1 non-thundercrash user but the debuffs will stack onto more thundercrash - Theoretically you could hit 7.5m damage with 5 titans + 1 stasis user.

We tested this number at Karl and the Lake of Shadows boss, but the footage is just from Karl.




**Loadouts Used**

*Titan(s)*

* Cuirass of The Falling star
* Volatile Conduction (Artifact Mod)
* Focusing Lens (Artifact Mod)
* Something to redbar yourself on command, we used Mountain Top. Ricochet rounds would be more practical

*Other (In this case, Stasis Hunter)*

* Stasis Subclass w/ Duskfield grenade
* Divinity
* Sundering Glare




**Why Does This Work?**

There were a lot of little nuances that went into getting this right, the damage comes from a very specific string of events. 

The duskfield grenade is meant to freeze the enemy with a delay (a 3rd person can be used to throw a coldsnap instead right as titan is about to hit if you can't get this timing down). Once the debuffer throws the duskfield they immediately start tapping divinity - We are tapping to reduce the chance of breaking the target out of stasis. The reason we use duskfield for the delay is so that the divinity cage can proc as well as sundering glare (Divinity can proc sundering glare off its own cage). The tricky part is getting the timing right for the Titan(s), you have to hit the target while they are frozen for maximum damage (780k vs 975k) and that window is really small.

The reason this works is thanks to the [3.1.0 Patch Notes](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50097) including the following:

&gt; When frozen by Stasis, AI combatants now take 5% more damage from Special-ammo weapons, Heavy-ammo weapons, and non-Stasis abilities. 

We aren't entirely sure how the math checks out when going from 780k -&gt; 975k impact but someone can probably figure that part out. We assume it is because the 5% buff to abilities is applied first in the calculation. The rest of the damage comes from Divinity (30%), Sundering Glare (20%), Focusing Lens (20%), Cuirass of The Falling star (100%), and Volatile Conduction (30%).

We calculated the 1,500,000 number including the tick damage with a little bit of math because Karl or the LoS boss didn't have enough health. We took the base impact damage (150k) and determined ours was 6.5x higher (975k / 150k = 6.5). With that we scaled up the base damage with ticks from 225k to about 1.5m (225k x 6.5 = ~1.5m). Realistically, the damage is probably closer to 1.2m or 1.3m after ticks unless you can keep your target frozen for the duration of the ticks.




**Final Thoughts**

This is a niche application but there may be scenarios where it will work, the main requirement being that the divinity person has to  be far enough to proc Sundering Glare - If you add more people to the equation it becomes easier to perform. The problem with adding more people is that you quickly do less damage than if you just had 2 Thundercrashes. 

The biggest thing making this hard to accomplish is the tiny window you have to hit the boss while frozen before they break out or Divinity breaks them out. If you can control that better, you can more reliably hit the big number. However without the frozen buff, you can still hit 780k impact (~1.17m with ticks), which is still a very large number.",1613870293,2021-02-20 20:18:13

raidsecrets,Constellation found in Shuro Chi's encounter under the Gazebo?," Hi guys, prepare a therapy session for me after this one. You will think that I am crazy but I did my best and I want to hear your opinion about this subject. Let’s begin.

**Context:**  
3-4 months ago, me and my friend were exploring through the last wish raid, we arrived to Shuro Chi, we climbed the rock and went straight to the puzzles and stuff, our primary reason for that was to “explore” cuz we were bored and verifiy if the wish plates are still there, why? As we know, Titan (which had 1 of the plates behind that door) was vaulted and we thought they might just remove or move them or something. After a few minutes, my friend called me under a gazebo to show me something that was shining, there was a “galaxy design” but with a few stars brighter then others. Shining, fading and doing their animation. My friend told me there should be something.. maybe a puzzle or something, I called him crazy at first, even tho- he was kinda right, the stars were a bit suspect at this point. My mind was like: This raid is old, there should be a post or something here, right? I couldn’t find any. But, I wasn’t really into this theory. After a while, I was thinking if there could be any puzzles left or any easter eggs besides 15th wish. After a while, there it was:

**Beginning:**

I was in my physics class (don’t ask) when I was thinking about the star map (https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLuETOCJ3rwAYy-IoYYxD-C\_bg1yQ8uvup&amp;v=k9QJEoxcPjo) that Shuro Chi presented us in a patrol mission. I linked it to trailers based on: Dreaming, **Stars**, Future, Curse and other key words. I was marked by: “**That map isn’t just decoration**”. Which made me think about other decorations that can lead to something. Maybe the stars found in Shuro Chi encounter?..

**Finding a ramp:**

After school I went to Shuro Chi encounter in Last Wish raid and thought about possible position of the stars. Why you might ask. Because, apparently all these stars are in a different place then the others. The stars are not disappearing (just fading), or moving. Some are brighter then others (like in real life), but It isn’t just decoration.. At least I feel like it. I took some screenshots and move it to photoshop where I tried to highlight with a different color and try to link them. But before that, I found others interesting things. Like:

**Shuro Chi standing place is part of the “star map”? (**I think that was known before, I couldn’t find it tho-**): https://imgur.com/a/qDE1Qnh**

**Shuro Chi plates has a design like wish plates (**Old and known, but might be useful in the future**): https://imgur.com/a/VLD5HSM**

**Stars are visible in the dark side of the Whisper of the Worm scope (**Some other light are visible too, but others.. even brighter, are not**):  https://imgur.com/a/8LppR0D**

**https://imgur.com/a/WXSoIcH**

(Not necessary helpful but It might say something about the lighting effect of the stars) 

**And more things like that (I will update this list if needed).**

**Theory 1** 

The stars are actually constellations from real life. We got the 4 categories in the “wall of wishes” symobl list: Fish, Dragon, Eagle/Bird, Snake. And we got constellation for every category AND some versions of it:

**FISH (Pisces): https://imgur.com/a/gXcGhHu**

**EAGLE (Aquila): same link**

**DRAGON (Draco): same link**

**SNAKE (Serpens): same link**

**..and some derivations of their main constellation like: Flying fish, water snake and others.**

Maybe we can link the stars from the gazebo in a pattern like the stars in real life and find symbols from wall of wishes. That can lead to a code that opens something if you introduce it in wall of wishes not necessary “15th wish”, mby?

**Theory 2**

The stars don’t relate to the stars in real life and we have to link them ourselves in order to find the correct symbol.

For example (from real life): https://imgur.com/a/42jaRvw

I found a dragon inside this gazebo: https://imgur.com/a/InO4qrS

This can be an infinite snake: https://imgur.com/a/XucFmOe

And the list goes on.

That was the first thing that I thought about. Maybe I wasn’t wrong, maybe I was.

**Theory 3**

Maybe we can make a map out of this stars which can lead up to somewhere on dreaming city. Why is that a possible Theory? Due to the fact that if you watch the map of the dreaming city, we can see some white stars similar to the gazebo stars

What I mean:

**Why I believe it can lead up to something?**

I think we can get something out of this because, as we know, Bungie left us with a “teaser” or maybe a hint linked to 15 eyes in a cutscene in the middle of the space, like a constellation. It was related to 15th wish. You can read more about this in this reddit post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep\_stone\_crypt\_cutscene\_constellation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/kp1c27/deep_stone_crypt_cutscene_constellation/)

Maybe Bungie tried to remind us about this little “puzzle”. Also, any progress on the Deep Stone Crypt Theory? Let me know.

Also, these gazebos are different from the others, not even Petra’s have those type of stars.

Maybe we can also form a constellation on that DSC constellation and link to Shuro Chi’s stars, somehow.

**Making of the code**

Ok, let’s pretend it is an possible theory. But.. How can we make a code after that?

Let’s say we include it in the wall of wishes. How are we sorting the code?

**Methode 1**

Some gazebo have a circular part around it: https://imgur.com/a/hRquntZ

We can consider it like a sorting mechanism where these parts represents the fact that the symbol is in the middle of other 4 symbols or 4 spaces.

Or, we can consider the little lamps some sort of positioning order or something like that.

**Methode 2**

We place it in the order of the encounter and position on the map. In different position based on the level of the gazebo and other place factors.

**Methode 3**

We can place every stars and make a map out of it which in that situation we can’t use wall of wishes out of that. Or we can unite only the brighter stars.

**Methode 4**

We link every gazebo and paste it inside the wall of wishes, after that we can count the number of bullets we need to use based on stars that are filled in the circles.

**We can try everything to sort it.**

**Conclusion**

This could be a great puzzle if it is supposed to be like that. Hope you understand what I am saying cuz I don’t have a great english overall. I hope this will lead to something, else.. I will get Therapy.",1613771222,2021-02-19 16:47:02

I particularly remember it being on NvUs Gaming's channel. I think it could be done in The Barrens on Mars somehow involving an out of bounds where you jumped into the ceiling, and somewhere on earth. The glitch allows you to duplicate your hitbox, damage other players, and causes enemies to not see you. I believe it also caused other players to not be able to see you or show your hitbox as loading.

I've wanted to learn this for a really long time and have done a lot of research but haven't had any luck. If anyone knows anything I'll be super grateful :)",1613707103,2021-02-18 22:58:23
raidsecrets,Captains Log Lore page states first location of a Glykon Smuggler’s Compartment,"After your second completion of Presage quest (i.e. when you received your first Dead Man’s Tale with a random role), you will also receive your first piece of lore aka a page of the captains log. The final paragraph reads as follows: 

‘FRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Smuggler's switches still working. Maintenance side-hatch. Had to kick in the vent.’

This, quite clearly, is a clue to a smugglers compartment stated in the ‘Tucked away’ triumph. 12 lore pages suggests 12 smugglers compartments.

These compartments seemingly are attributed to the yellow-rimmed screens found lying around the place. In your next run, you’ll find that the first of of these you come across can now be activated, opening a door and revealing a chest (which for me contained an ‘at power level’ piece of gear). After finishing this run and after a lot of snooping, there are in fact 12 of these pads lying around throughout the mission, which adds up. Sadly however, you don’t get another piece of lore if you complete it again. My guess that it is going to be 1 captains log page per week.

By checking on Light.gg, each of the log books does have a clue at the end of it, lets hope 12 weeks of effort is worth it!

Other notable items I found that seemingly will be scanable in the coming weeks are; 

- a yellow data pad in the room with the large cabal ship, after the room with the two ultra abominations
- a dead scorn which appears to be on an examining table 
- a dead ghost in the area before the rally flag point
- a chalice under the walkway in the very final room

This is largely due to the RNG factor which the spawning/ placement of where the fuses will appear. Every time the compactor fully “closes” and then resets, the fuses have a chance to move.

So I was just doing the usual Strike playlist, nothing to crazy, but then i got loaded into a strike somewhere in the tangled shore, no dialogue, no indication of a mission, nothing.  


The strike started in one of the crashed Dreadnaught ships, there was only one wy deeper, with a bunch of Hive worshipping their worship like they always do.  
Me and my fireteam consisting of random players proceeded to kill them, but then there was just nothing else to do, only a door with a giant seal on it.   
I looked around there to find a way deeper in there, or some way to carry on the strike, but there was nothing.  


Then i tried backtracking, and i ended up in the Jetsam of Saturn, once there i saw some of these wierd bubbles, like some hive broodcells. I shot them and once i did that my game just crashed, and I had no way of returning to that strike.  
I looked for it on the Tangled Shore, as well as the other Destinations (just to be safe, not that i excpected it to be there)

The Darkness is a prime example of this. Since 2014, The Darkness has been the main antagonist of the Destiny Universe but was never directly addressed in major story plot points until Destiny 2's post credit cutscene. Before then it was only mentioned and talked about in grimoire cards back in D1. On the topic of 'The Darkness' and Grimoire cards...

Do you see it? Look at how undeniably similar the artwork from the card and the new environmental assets in the quest are. They are almost identical if not the same thing. The spores are glowing blue and growing from a foundation just like in the image from the card. The vein/tendril looking things are also sprouting from them just like on the image of the card as well the in game ones. Coincidence? I think not... However we are not done yet. Now it is time to connect these things with the darkness itself.

After shooting these spores you gain an effect called 'Egregore Link'. When you have this effect you are able to pass through these glowing, burning barriers which Osiris calls darkness radiation or energy. Now what is an Egregore? A quick google search:

**Egregore** (also spelled **egregor**; from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) *égrégore*, from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language) *egrḗgoros* 'wakeful') is an [occult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult) concept representing a distinct [non-physical entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity) that arises from a collective group of people. Historically, the concept referred to angelic beings, or [watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(angel)), and the specific rituals and practices associated with them, namely within [Enochian traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian_magic).

Very interesting stuff... Non physical entity? Sound familiar? The darkness has been described many times in lore to be a non physical entity. What is 'Enochian traditions'?

**Enochian magic** is a system of [ceremonial magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_magic) based on the evocation and commanding of various [spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit). It is based on the 16th-century writings of [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee) and [Edward Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley), who claimed that their information, including the revealed [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian) language, was delivered to them directly by various angels. Dee's journals contained the [Enochian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian), and the tables of correspondences that accompany it. Dee and Kelley believed their visions gave them access to secrets contained within the [*Book of Enoch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch).

Could this be a hint to our next set of powers? Very interesting stuff. The second word, 'Link' of the effect 'Egregore Link' seems to suggest that we have connected with this fungus or infection, spiritually to allow us to pass through it's barriers. Without it we seemingly burn when touching the barrier. Now look at the effect around the borders of your screen when you have this effect applied to your guardian:

Where else have we seen this effect before? Take a look at these...

That's right. The pyramid's barriers which Ghost also calls a massive energy spike. Does this connect whatever these tendrils and infestations are with the darkness directly? Going by the Grimoire card image resemblance to the in game assets as well as the visual connections with the pyramid's barriers, I think it is safe to say that there is definitely a deliberate connection here. However there is still one more thing to discuss...

The Drifter.

There is only one other place that we have seen these tendrils before and it is inside the Drifter's ship. Take a look at this.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TmuDR-wiiX4NRAttHIXv4k3Yp57iMPI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TmuDR-wiiX4NRAttHIXv4k3Yp57iMPI/view?usp=sharing)

You see them? Back in season of the drifter, you could go around the back of his ship to an icy area with these tendrils again and a tent with a tape recording in it. In the lore that came with season of the drifter, the Drifter explains and describes a trip that he went on with his crew to an icy planet. On this planet he said there were creatures that emitted an aura of pure darkness which repressed light. When they got close, his crew members lost their light and died in their sleep to the cold. The ice surrounding the room with the tent in it could be bungie trying to show a basic visual description as to what this place looked like. Throwing the container tent in there could also be a direct reference to the tent they were sleeping in whilst on that planet. Unfortunately I do not have an image of this room but I'm sure there are various videos out there where you can see it. Here is an image in the gambit prep room.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLx-W-AGIDcIXb8QSVZauANGweJED8fy/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLx-W-AGIDcIXb8QSVZauANGweJED8fy/view?usp=sharing)

So what does this all mean? Could this be the start of a new enemy race being foreshadowed? When could we expect to see these creatures that drifter saw? Judging by the story direction I think Lightfall is the most likely candidate for when we'll see these things arrive. This is all very interesting and quite deliberate referencing from bungie and so I definitely believe that we are in some state of foreshadowing for bigger things to come... and this is only the beginning. Expect more small hints as the seasons move forward whether they are physical or visual representations in game or through lore.

One last thing I forgot to mention is the black armoury papers' description on these creatures as well. 'Smell of wet earth and sound like a machine being stretched and then compressed'. This is some concept art from bungie on something that fits this description. Also when you are moving throughout the mission's tunnels and small spaces you can hear groans and breathing which fits this description of the papers. Whether those noises are from that scorn boss or not it still sounds rather distinct. However this could be a stretch.

Thanks for reading my post, let me know what you think.

Ps. If anyone from Bungie sees this, tell the talented team that they did an amazing job with this quest. From visuals to storytelling, sound design and gameplay. Pure Awesomeness. This is what makes Destiny unique. Keep it up!

In the dark maze area (you know the one where you drop down through the floor with the effect active) there is a small door that looks similar to the trash compactor door.  To open it, Proceed as you normally would in the maze to complete it. As soon as you pull the lever that is found immediately after exiting the maze, go back in the maze and find the door before the effect wears off. It’s now open. It opens a hallway with a small window that requires the effect to get through. Get the effect and go through. Unfortunately it’s completely empty and a dead end.

raidsecrets,How powerful is our guardian and how under-powered/leveled are other guardians in-game?,"So I want to start off by saying that our Guardian is probably the highest ""power"" level of any of the guardians besides the vanguard and the main cast (Osiris, Ana, etc) maybe even more powerful than them. 

At the start of the red war (Making a new character) everyone had the same armor, weapons, etc. However, as time progressed and we've gained more powerful, no other guardian seem to be anywhere close to our power, which has been bothering me for a while. Our guardian has high stat/high quality armor and gear. Our weapons are extremely good and we almost always have an exotic and always have at least 3.

We've seen other in-game characters like the Dredgen in that Drifter cutscene and now we've seen another guardian (the one in the new mission) The Dredgen uses the makeshift Thorn, and Shards and other Legendary gear but he has been around a while to know Drifter and about Shin. However, the guardian in the new mission is using all WHITE or Common gear but he had an exotic. So that begs the question, if the ordinary guardian is still using white/common gear than how overpowered is our guardian. 

That guardian in the mission wasn't a new light either, he had done quite a few runs of the Menagerie and is even well aquatinted with Calus; and again, he is using common gear, so I would say new lights are even worse off.  

Now I understand why the vanguard loses 9+ guardians in a simple strike, everyone/the average guardian, uses common gear...",1613613275,2021-02-17 20:54:35

Second I can't really recall, it was at a small drop down. Did not really figure out the way to open it.
Third one is in de dark ""maze"" part, where you have to smash all the panels to find your way. Activate the lever behind the energy wall, but go back and you'll see a different energy wall back in the maze part.

raidsecrets,[SPOILERS] The Presage variation missions and the Crown of sorrow.,"\[Note, this is both a data mine and a glitch post.\]

From the datamined voicelines and dialogue, there is a variation of the Presage exotic mission where you talk and investigate **with Caiatl.** The reason why she is here is that she wants to investigate what happened to her father, Calus, and capture/punish him. We investigate the ship with her and Osiris, but the voice lines mention **the crown of sorrow, and how it not only controls minds but merges them. I presume we later either find and investigate it or fight enemies corrupted by it, but again these are only presumptions.** Also, JLoughlen on Twitter went out of bounds and found the crown of sorrow on the Glykon.

Normally if you smoke grenade yourself, you get no melee energy.

Throw a smoke far away, run into it after it explodes.

When you become invis you will also get half melee energy. 

Because you didn't become invis immediately it thought you were an ally and granted melee energy. Doing this with a friend will give you a full smoke from the ally, then yourself. Combine this with 100 mobility and gamblers dodge and you can have infinite invisibility while solo. 2 smokes used then returned to 2 smoke charges. (2 halves + 1 Gamblers dodge every 11-14 seconds)",1613466592,2021-02-16 04:09:52

raidsecrets,Speculating on the Exotic Scout Rifle,"We know it is a Tex Mechanica scout rifle, and so is highly likely lever-action. This makes me think it will fire at a unique RPM for scouts, something like 100 RPM with higher, harder-hitting damage. It could be balanced by having to reload bullets individually into an internal tube magazine (a common design component of lever-action rifles). This would explain giving the rifle a (datamined) perk like “Cranial Spike” that gradually increases reload for chaining precision shots, as you would be able to rapidly hasten the process of individually loading rounds. 
The rifle probably has a magazine of around 14 bullets, and I honestly expect it to have very high damage for a scout rifle, if not closer to a hand cannon. The drawback of this high damage is probably a relatively slow fire rate (having to manually rack the lever to rechamber after firing) and a low zoom factor - the gun seems to have iron sights.
I’d expect some form of “Gunslinger’s Trance” perk allowing you to increase the RoF by chaining precision shots, allowing you to increase its versatility in PVE. 
Personally I just hope the levering animation and sound design are great. This thing should sound gritty and powerful, like it really kicks. Nothing fancy here.",1613432845,2021-02-15 18:47:25

raidsecrets,shit-post theory (not really),"To cut to the chase, what if our guardians are actually being ""corrupted"" by Savathun? And she's currently deceiving us to hearing other guardians like Crow and Shaxx whistle it. As our guardians know from Eris that's an enormous red flag. Assuming Savathun knows WE know, could it be possible we're actually being ""corrupted""? 

A reason why I think this is a possibility is due to how unbelievably powerful we are as guardians, killing gods and all that. As far as I'm aware, no one else (guardians specifically) has done that. Savathun obviously knows who we've killed, etc. So to me, it'd make sense why she'd use us as a pawn since we are so powerful. I don't see the traveler helping us since we sorta? sided with the darkness and achieving stasis.

Sorry for the super surface-level theory, I'm just curious if this could be possible. I also apologize if this has been posted a bunch before.",1613190626,2021-02-12 23:30:26

raidsecrets,Half-baked Savathûn theory,"Honestly, I don’t think this could be all that plausible, but I figured that sharing this theory could at least open up a discussion about what might be next. 

Savathûn, so I’ve heard, is the Hive leader (god?) of tricks, similar to Loki in the Marvel line of things, although Marvel has nothing to do with this theory. 

Savathûn’s song, having been around for almost a year I believe, in game at least, is supposedly an infectious tune, that burrows deep into the listener’s mind, and acts as a switch, once flipped, doing bidding for the host, in this case Savathûn. If she truly is the god of trickery, and we have a largely assumed Hive DLC approaching, could this all be a trick? 

Savathûn surely hates guardians, we’ve been there, figured that out for quite a long time. Thus, we keep hearing about the song, not always what it means (besides a few times), but we hear it. We hear it and know that whoever does so is infected, and sometimes, infected must be put down.

What happens when Savathûn decides to ‘activate’ one of these agents, one such like Shaxx, whose had his Ahamkara whispering into his ear for so long? We have to put them down, they are exiled, whatever we can do to make sure they won’t harm people. Recently, our semi-freshly revived avian friend has been whistling the tune to himself, but who would he have heard the song from? Shaxx has his bones, Eris has vast knowledge, but could have easily been corrupted by the eyes she’s placed within herself.

The point is, we have to deal with people when they’ve been ‘activated’, in a way that protects others. What if Savathûn is using this to her advantage? What if perhaps, the Crow isn’t whistling the obscure hive tune, perhaps Shaxx’s ‘Moon Cheese Song’ never happened, or if it did, perhaps it happened differently. 

What if we, as a guardian had heard the song, nobody else, save for the rest of us around on this post, and floating around the EDZ in orbit. What if we had been ‘activated’ already, and these tunes we’re hearing are Savathûn playing with us, turning our suspicions towards fellow guardians rather than her? 

Now for a really big stretch. What if Savathûn’s song had been with us for so much longer? What if her song was around when Cayde-6 died? Maybe Uldren deserved it, but what if like him, we weren’t thinking clearly ourselves? The Hive definitely have a connection with the black fleet, worshipping them, and Uldren just so happened to be corrupted by Riven herself, an Ahamkara just as the one that hangs above our Crucible master? Perhaps Uldren wasn’t just corrupted by ‘Darkness’, but rather Savathûn’s song? She’s already made deals with Riven before.

What if we are doing what she wants us to do? All of these things, where we’re hearing her tune burrow deep into our minds, where Shaxx sings for Saladin, what if they never truly happened that way? 

While the part about Forsaken is definitely not true, I think that there’s at least some small shred of information in here that may come true. We’re all hoping that the Witch Queen DLC has some extreme plot twists to play off of Savathûn’s nature, maybe this is it.


TL;DR: I think Savathûn has been controlling us, and the instances we here her song are false, her turning us against our own.

Thanks for reading this overly long, and half-baked theory, would love to here your thoughts!",1613177146,2021-02-12 19:45:46

raidsecrets,[SPOILERS] Nessus tank datamine information (Proving grounds strike),"From the Ginsor datamine, there are a ton of things about the season waiting to be uncovered. A few things I uncovered were about the Proving Grounds strike we are getting later in the season, and I will share some with you.   


* The Land tank is called the ""**Halphas Electus**.""
* The boss is not Caiatl, but Caiatl's ""chosen,"" who is called **Ignovun, chosen of Caiatl.** 
* Ignovun's helm was crafted by Psions and gives Ignovun the power of Psions themselves.
* Some text strings found include: ""Caiatl's chosen warrior waits deep within her fortified tank. But if we lose, we surrender Nessus and support her claim to the imperial throne,"" and “The Rite of Proving is over. By the victor's rule, the Halphas Electus, and the souls aboard it, are yours to destroy.”
* Another line is ""Overload power systems in the undercarriage section of the strike Proving Grounds,"" and there's also ""Eliminate all Cabal VIPS in the strike Proving Grounds.""
* ""Empress Caiatl has deployed a tank fortress to Nessus and opened an invitation to survivors of the Red Legion to **vie for a seat on her War Council.** Vanquish the Cabal and prove yourself in glorious combat against her Chosen. Join a fireteam of three and face the forces of Empress Caiatl.""
* ""Commander Zavala has informed you that **you have been chosen to fight for the City aboard the Imperial Land Tank, the Halphas Electus, on Nessus.** Caiatl has accepted the challenge. Zavala tells you to assemble your fireteam and bring Caiatl's champion to their knees. He reminds you that if Caiatl suffers defeat here, she will have no choice but to concede or risk humiliation.""

Extra: There's a line that talks about winning something, possibly winning in the strike or becoming the new ""champion."" It also says when that happens, Caiatl will cease all hostilities and her forces will never set foot on Earth again. **It also says that Zavala will become ""Bracus Zavala"" and will serve on Caiatl's war council.**

raidsecrets,[TONS OF SPOILERS] The Glykon and the Dead Man's tale.," When looking into the 10,000 text strings that Ginsor datamined, I noticed a lot of interesting things about the new mission for the season exotic weapon we are getting.  

* The quest and mission for the exotic are called “Presage,” definition is a sign or warning. 
* The mission is onboard the **Glykon (Volatus)**, a cabal ship that used to be Calus's that disappeared and reappeared in reef space. 
* A guardian sent a distress signal with an encoded Loyalist signature used by **Calus**, so that means Caiatl is also investigating. It also says Caiatl helped us with the investigation, maybe meaning we'll hear dialogue from her in the mission since there are lines directed at her. 
* We need to discover clues inside of the Glykon, including a smuggling compartment. 
* The guardian that sent the distress signal says that if we get him out of the ship, he will offer his rifle, presumably the dead man's tale. 
* He also forged a replacement trigger assembly, and we have to look for it. Whatever that is.
* We are supposed to find clues in the ship, and instead of wine, there is concentrated dark ether on the ship similar to Gahlrain’s chamber in the royal baths. The text strings also mention the **crown of sorrow** multiple times, maybe the mission or another quest’s main objective is recovering or doing something with the crown of sorrow. 
* Dead man’s tale is an exotic lever-action scout rifle and a custom craft tex machina weapon that was never reported to the vanguard. 
* The catalyst is gotten through kills, but also **“hidden caches”** onboard the Glykon.
* From another Reddit source: ""Skull Piercing"" Consecutive precision hits grant extra damage bonus and the Catalyst ""Dark Forged Trigger"" Increase hip fire speed and accuracy.
* Presage mission has a master difficulty and there are many trackers based on time, carries, etc. 

There is a lot more about the Glykon in the text strings I haven't fully understood or uncovered yet, so feel free to search in this github link here: [https://gist.github.com/Ginsor/92f15c8cd29da05ad1e0a7beecaf1aff](https://gist.github.com/Ginsor/92f15c8cd29da05ad1e0a7beecaf1aff)

raidsecrets,Few changes to Atraks I noticed after chosens patch,"All the previous shanks in the atraks encounter were called tracer shanks yet fired the same way a vandal would, now they have wire rifles which hurt a bit harder

During the down phases on each floor and the time between the first 4 and second 4 damage phases significantly more ads now spawn in, snipers, dregs, wretches and maybe more all spawn in pretty consistantly.

The break between the servitors spawning and the atraks damage phase seems significantly shorter, we were struggling to get 6 people up to the top before it started.

This is really anecdotal and will probably be extremely hard to test but I feel like everything is doing a ton more damage to you, we had a few deaths to adds compared to the usual absolute stomping of the raid.

And another note with my current colourblind settings ( yellow-blue ) the operator and scanner are completely indistinguishable.

The arrival of the darkness has also begun to redo what it has done before as shown and why the triangle and circle move counterclockwise as if to symbolize the idea of our progress in the new golden age comes to an end as we begin the new dark age.

It's during the 3rd encounter where you have to find and kill 3 Wizards that spawn at random symbols. It's around the area circled in white in the picture below. I haven't looked for any others and really only found it because it was glowing. Maybe it's connected to the symbols appearing on all of the Season of the Hunt weapons?

raidsecrets,New Info on Exotic Scout,"So I was attempting to obtain the new Year of the Ox emblem that is circulating on a Chinese app (still haven't managed to..) 

In doing so I found an article on said app about the new Scout Rifle coming soon. 

I used my phone camera apps ""auto translate"" to get the rough English discription, from what I can tell 

the main perk is called ""Skull Piercing"" Consecutive precision hits grant extra damage bonus

and the Catalyst ""Dark Forged Trigger"" Increase hip fire speed and accuracy.

There is also some implication to lore (rough translation from chinese): ""In terms of plot, a guardians invitation to Karus (encouraged). Go down and catch the Kabar ship with the crown of grief contempt for the family (Scorn, Charm), want to extract drakness for research. When the keeper and kabar logged onto the ship ,they found out, The flouting clan above is endless, and it is immediately resurrectd by dark energy. Last keeper and kabbah trapped in the ship, the keepers dexterity was infected by the darkness and the keeper had to shoot himself at TA's dexterity.""

Clearly there is a lot of incorrect translations throughout but the main gist can be seen.

Gave a shout out to Houndish on Twitter about it. Link with screenshot here:

raidsecrets,Possibility of Siva returning?,"Tinfoil hat time

So obviously siva still remains in the game to some extent, through some ornaments and other eververse cosmetics having siva themes, as well as Outbreak Perfected. Most of these were introduced in season of the worthy as they linked to Rasputin and the iron lords. However this season we got a new anarchy ornament with siva on it, but this season isn't linked to raasputin and is about the cabal. 

As well as this, Lord Saladin has also been given a bit of story significance in cutscenes and voice lines etc. The last time he was given a main role in a story was 4 years ago when Rise of Iron dropped in D1, where we fought, you guessed it, Siva. With Bungie's new model of an expanding storyline, Lord Saladin should continue to play a part in the storyline and siva may come with him.

Iron banner will happen weeks 3 and 10, both of these weeks have seasonal challenges related to iron banner

Week 8 has a challenge specifying that the ordeal during that week is going to be the new strike Proving Grounds. Assuming they keep the same 6-week nightfall rotation structure, this means that week 2 (next week) will also be proving grounds nightfall. Oddly enough the first challenge related to GM’s is actually on week 6, so it will not be able to be completed for a week.

raidsecrets,All Season of the Chosen challenges,"Greetings Guardians

Rummaging around in the API has revealed *every single seasonal challenge, broken down by week*. I have compiled all of the information for you to view here.

As always - I've created a [Google Sheet with all of the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jQ1-QzsZKAyenmTgLhpoZ42R1J9LmUI47JR5EAu8wM/edit?usp=sharing). I trust the app devs will make this data available on their platforms soon enough, but this is what is currently available to us.

Weekly bounties have been consolidated and slimmed down to better fit the season while still encouraging weekly play of more than just a few hours via strikes, crucible, gambit, and battlegrounds. As we progress later into the season, the challenges grow in size but decrease in volume - so we have to do less things but they're harder to do.

This list is subject to change, since some of the objectives and rewards seem pretty slim and not fully fleshed out, so we'll see what changes in the future other than the 2 redacted objectives that likely have to do with the exotic and the ship.

**Story highlights** :

an assassination attempt is in motion to take down Zvala in the City by one of  Caiatl's councilors after a truce was made.

The Crow managed to stealth his way to the City reaching Ikora &amp; Osiris explaining to them all about the plot.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Osiris:**  *Make your preparations. I'll reach out to Caiatl to discuss this.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Glint:**  *If we do not end this, it will escalate beyond our control. The City is at risk.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ikora :** *Keep your mask on. Always. Do not speak. Can I trust you to handle this with discretion?*  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Crow:**  *I should have kept my mask on, but I don't regret acting. I still think Zavala's in danger.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Mission descriptive :**

^(The Elite Psion you encountered on The City is plotting something. Help Crow investigate this further. Here you'll find the assets and information you need to complete our most time-sensitive operation.)

&gt;**Crow to Osiris:**  *You seem like a wise man.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:** *We both know that the best victory is won before the war even begins. I'm giving humanity a way out.*  *The Cabal have lost their home, not their honor. If we're to die, we will take many with us.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Crow:**  *Wait… you aren't going to tell the commander? This concerns him. He deserves to know.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ikora:** *This isn't the first time an enemy has infiltrated the City, and it won't be the last.*  *This is not an easy decision. You know that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Glint:**  *We need to act now.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:**  *We don't want Lord Saladin walking in while we're discussing this, trust me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Crow:**  *After everything the Cabal have done to us. After Ghaul! We are warriors. Why aren't we at war?*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Guardian:**  *If you want to repay me, keep that mask affixed to your face. It will protect you from the City's ignorance.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:** *I doubt such attempt to take down the commander can slip out of the empress fingers like that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ghost:** *if she's the one behind it, and Zvala knows after the truce. I can only think of an imminent clash that both sides can't handle.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ikora:** *This won't happen. If I truly understand him, he would prioritize the City over his fury.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*.. Zavala will challenge her to ceremonial combat, she must accept—or risk losing that support.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Humanity's champion versus the Cabal's. The winner dictates the future.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Osiris:**  *If we win, there's no guarantee Caiatl's followers will honor the result. Even if the empress herself does. That said, a lot of them are just as unhappy Caiatl tried to fold us into the empire.*",1612988639,2021-02-10 15:23:59

My strategy was I went into the shattered throne thrallway, and then went to the stairs where you get 1 line of thrall coming up, and then getting kills by aiming and using it like a normal bow and not using the exotic perk at all. Took maybe 20 minutes. Also I was using devour to stay alive.

raidsecrets,Possible Divinity Cheese," 

Hey r/raidsecrets, longtime lurkers here, comprising of u/CaleSpen,  u/boiofsteel and u/Pacchimari had embarked on the journey to get divinity and needless to say, we were exhausted and tired of a horrible experience from LFGing as we were always short a few members (most of my clan plays on PS4 but I’m on PC). The hope of a shorter run by backtracking from the boss for a way quicker div run was patched out as of the 3.0.2 Beyond light update. Represented by the huge ass locked door which leads the way out from the 3rd encounter ( https://imgur.com/a/fXjaKYI)  


This marked the end of our divine hopes, or so we thought. We glitched out of the map using a no turn back zone to cross the locked door and reach the other side, and then backtrack all the way to the first encounter to start the divinity puzzle and platforming with Salvation’s grip ( ol’ reliable weapon yes?). Then again, we were stuck at the door, and how to cross it.  
Once we end up on the other side of the door, one can navigate to the extreme left of the path where the door sits and climb up on the little platform, and then use salvation’s grip to get to the roof and cross the door. Since this is the same instance of the raid, divinity will be obtainable.

Lo and behold we ended up at the other side of the door, successfully being able to start and complete the divinity puzzles, and beat the boss to get the raid exotic. Note that a boss CP is required for this to work (duh)  
Here’s the link to the full video guide for the glitch :)  
https://youtu.be/3u4EN1uVQ2Y  


We sadly could not get the 4th box and onward to spawn so currently there’s no way to complete the quest, but we found this to be cool nonetheless and wanted to share it with the community  


If any content creators want to make a video on it, make sure to give credit to all 3 members of this post, and you are good to go :)

raidsecrets,Unmentioned evidence for the H.E.L.M. location in the repaired Old Tower.,"Firstly, I want to apologise if anything in this post has been previously posted. I’ve done my research and I believe the ideas in this post are original and my own, inspired by what I have seen and read. I’ve included the Foreshadowing section as context but its nothing new, so feel free to skip to the Cubemap and Trailer sections for my findings.

**Foreshadowing**

If there’s one thing that we know for sure, its that Bungie doesn’t tend to put work in to areas that don’t get use in the game, and they certainly don’t post things by accident.

One ‘accident’ however took place during Season of Arrivals, where the PlayStation Store updated their emblem for Destiny 2 to the image here - [New Evidence May Reveal Destiny 2’s End Of Season Event Ahead Of ‘Beyond Light’ (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/10/25/new-evidence-may-reveal-destiny-2s-end-of-season-event-ahead-of-beyond-light/?sh=259905992a34). This so-called leak became the catalyst for theories around a return to the original Tower and a reformed Traveller. At the end of the season, we witnessed the traveller heal before the release of beyond light, lending credit to the image as a new image and not one of the landscape during the D1 era. Additionally, posts on this subreddit detailed the subtle structural differences between the Tower in the linked image and the D1 Tower.

Sure enough, when we logged in on release day the Tower was still the regular D2 Tower. One thing had changed however – the Old Tower, destroyed 3 years ago, was now bearing signs of repairs taking place. Scaffolding and construction cranes were situated around the base of the Old Tower after no change to its design in so many years and expansions.

It is my belief that Bungie has been subtly sending signals that the Old Tower will be repaired and returned to the game over the course of this year. The question was not IF the Tower will return, but rather WHEN will it return.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cubemap vs. the Destiny 1 Tower**

This week gave us the trailer reveal for the upcoming season. In this trailer I spotted a couple of potential clues that would confirm the H.E.L.M is in fact situated in the repaired D1 Tower.

Firstly, there is the datamined Old Tower cubemap - [Destiny Cubemaps (montaguem.com)](http://montaguem.com/cubemaps?cubemap=environments_57?ver=v2922). Upon viewing, you will notice that this Tower map has significant differences from the D1 Tower. Primarily, the central red carpet, the large cut-out area at the front centre of the main courtyard platform, the different hanger area. Here is an image of the D1 Tower for reference - [https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Tower\_Plaza](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_Plaza).

It must be mentioned of course that the environment shown in the cubemap is subject to being scrapped or outdated and is no indication of release content. The idea that Bungie would allocate a chunk of its limited bandwidth to developing a new Tower social area, only to never release it, is a crazy one.

The cubemap shows some changes that would be consistent with Bungies description of the H.E.L.M. on their website. The H.E.L.M. is described as the “Vanguard staging ground”, and more importantly a “Spaceport”. Spaceports, by definition, house spaceships. More spaceships require more space, more space requires building alteration, extensions, or *an entirely new building with a large hanger*.

The cubemap shows just this, with a new large hanger area on the right and areas suitable for ship storage/docking on the main courtyard (potentially the triangular shapes in the ground). These are a new addition to the Tower map in comparison to the D1 Tower.

**Season of the Chosen Trailer and Website**

The trailer gave us a better look at the H.E.L.M. room, which overlooks the city from a different angle than the current tower, suggesting a new location. From my POV and with my FOV slider down, the position of the H.E.L.M. seems to be consistent with the Old Tower’s location.

Additionally, the main reason I made this post is to make some comparisons of the view seen through the H.E.L.M. window to the cubemap and D1 Tower.

Firstly, the image of that view - [Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/qkwk5o9). Ignoring the drawn arrows, you can see a red and grey shape on the middle right side of the image (between the red line and the glowing buildings). Upon closer inspection this looks very much like the postmaster’s building in the D1 Tower Courtyard, which does also appear in the cubemap. The cubemap again -  [Destiny Cubemaps (montaguem.com)](http://montaguem.com/cubemaps?cubemap=environments_57?ver=v2922).

Secondly, in the centre of the image to the left of the Titan’s hip you can see at least one cylindrical-ish structure which looks very much like the D1 courtyard vault situated opposite the postmaster. It has to be noted that the vaults do not appear in the cubemap (although the cubemap is by no means final).

Thirdly, playing the video slowly at this point, the view can be split into 3 visible levels of depth; the foreground (the Guardians in the H.E.L.M.), the middle-ground (the potential courtyard area, vaults and postmaster), and the background (the city). Close inspection of the relative movement of these different levels confirms the position of the H.E.L.M. as being positioned in the large Traveller-facing windowed room atop the tower.

This can be backed up by the structure of the H.E.L.M. window area, with the rounded window and two separators being consistent with the rounded Restored Tower window in the cubemap.

(The screenshot is from approx. 0.49 in the trailer, I recommend playing this part at a slow speed or going frame-by-frame to get a good look)

Additionally, the image posted on Bungies website for the H.E.L.M. featured an area seen through the window that resembles the new hanger area featured in the cubemap. The image is here -  [nVLnOt2.png (1363×566) (imgur.com)](https://i.imgur.com/nVLnOt2.png) . Notice the angle of the outside walls behind the flags. Also notice the subtle yellow accent. These are consistent with the updated hanger area shown in the cubemap and fit with the theme of the H.E.L.M. acting as a spaceport.

Edit: It's come up a couple of times in the comments now, so I'll say it in this post. The Old Tower does appear in the trailer in its destroyed form, alongside a Guardian and Iron Banner decorations. As per the season calendar, there are a couple of iron banner events on the calendar before the Guardian Games kick off. The most likely solution here is that the H.E.L.M. will launch as the only accessible part of the Old Tower, then over the course of the season the repairs will continue. The fact that the calendar separates the Guardian Games and the Guardian Games Closing Ceremony implies that there will be something significant happening during the ceremony. I believe the Old Tower, now the fully built H.E.L.M. will be accessible to players. This explains the separation of the games from the ceremony on the calendar as well as the shot of the unrepaired Tower in the trailer.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

· The presence of the vault and postmaster in the H.E.L.M. eliminates the possibility of it being an updated/new area in our current tower.

· The H.E.L.M. window design is consistent with the window seen in the rebuilt Tower cubemap.

· The H.E.L.M.s position is consistent with the Old Tower's position relative to the city.

· The structure spotted outside the H.E.L.M. window on the left is consistent with the Hanger design and position in the rebuilt Tower cubemap.

· The view in the trailer from the H.E.L.M. window also shows structures that look like the postmaster and vault in roughly their D1 Tower positions.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the awards, much appreciated. Just like to remind folks, I'm no Byf/Datto and I wont pretend to know everything so all corrections and additions in the comments are welcome!",1612461356,2021-02-04 12:55:56

raidsecrets,Potential Glitch in Thrallway 'Super-Nade',"Ok, so I found a glitch. I am not able to repeat it consistently. I have no idea if it can be useful or if it's a waste of time. I have not done a ton of testing on it. I was in the first Thrallway in shattered throne right after the Ogres in the rafters area. I was afk grinding grenade kills for the triumphs on a bottom tree solar titan. I was backed way into the corner against the fence where you can still farm XP, but I had to reposition the mouse every once in a while because the character slowly turns towards where no enemies come. I usually just point straight down because it takes longer for the character to move to the empty area and can easily survive a grenade going off even on his foot.

As a test, I thought maybe I could turn my back to the enemies and bounce it off the wall and have better luck not having to babysit him. So I took 1 step away from the fence and then jammed him into the corner [where the cross hairs are pointing.](http://imgur.com/a/DadOTQg) While facing horizontal (not up or down), into the corner, I threw a 'nade, but heard 8+ audio cues all on top of each other and died to the explosion on full health standing in a sunspot. I got it to happen twice more, seemingly randomly, but not since. Took me maybe 10-12 minutes. On the second one, my body went SAILING. Like, Prospector flag plant sailing.

Since I have no idea what matters, I'll just tell you everything. I had on the Hallowfire chest with discipline, melee resistance, and void resistance. All other armors had only discipline on. I was holding a Gnawing Hunger with demolitionist with a Hailing Confusion and Commemoration stowed. And I had on the Fusion Grenades.",1612403028,2021-02-03 20:43:48

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

After some digging and code breaking, I have formulated a theory about the Cabal text at the end of the Season of the Chosen trailer. But first, how I got there:

**The alphabet**

Like many did after seeing the Cabal symbols at the end of the trailer, I began my search here at r/raidsecrets. I search for a cabal alphabet. I quickly found one [(this one)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8gkyfg/decoded_the_cabal_text_in_the_warmind_web_comic/) and started to decipher the code. Or so I thought. It turned out the code does not use any (that I'm aware off) letters from the Cabal alphabet. First solution busted. Onto the next.

**The Numbers (Mason, what do they mean?)**

My next step was to find a decoder for the Cabal numerical system. Again, my search led me here. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/71k3n2/cleaned_up_the_cabal_numbers/) linked me to a clean set of numbers I could use to decipher the message. However, this was easier said than done. Some symbols are flipped or upside down. Making it harder to decipher.

While I was deciphering, I noticed something. I had seen some of them before. My search led me into a deeper hole. Unfortunately I can no longer find the post that helped me further, but this post gave me a new insight. ***The first code we see in the trailer is similar to that of the Skyburners Command Beacon on the Dreadnaught. It's flipped, but otherwise completely the same.***

The rest of the code is all pretty hard to decipher because of the distortion, but [I found similarities](https://ibb.co/V216Zrk) between the code in the trailer and other Cabal symbols (for example: at the drill in one of the strikes).

**The theory**

The text shown in the trailer has major similarities to the Skyburners Command Beacon from the Dreadnaught and [the trailer even shows](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/744432512503119882/806184865329971270/unknown.png) (credit: u/pulpfree) the Skyburner's Oath symbol. I theorize that the ship we see in the trailer is an older Skyburner's ship which Calus uses to keep his Scorn (in some of the SotH armor, the lore talks about Calus abducting Scorn. ). There is a high probability this ship is floating around Phobos (Mars). Hinting at the fact the ship is 'corrupted' (?) and has shutdown. Also linking to Osiris' ""There is no light here"".

I have the weird feeling a god is playing with us as we speak. Controlling this game from the shadows. It requires more time to truly formulate a coherent theory for (I assume) Witch Queen.

u/MatrixDiamonds and  u/LettuceDifferent5104 talked about the ship being similar or maybe even the same as [The Cassini](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cassini). A concept art dating back to 2013, which would be a location that can be explored by players.

**Expanding the theory**

[Another theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/lc3rxo/discussing_the_no_light_ship_from_the_trailer_as/) by [u/mrmeep321](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrmeep321/) has come to my attention and I’d like to use it to further develop my theory of the Distress Call and the mysterious ship floating in space. 

[u/mrmeep321](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrmeep321/) and my theory clash on some points, but I believe that they can form a more coherent theory about a possible storyline. If you want to read the full theory, [you can here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/lc3rxo/discussing_the_no_light_ship_from_the_trailer_as/). To summarize MrMeep’s theory: he thinks the broken ship is floating around in the Kuiper belt and is overrun with Darkness. According to The Chronicon, Calus has sent some of his shadows to Athanaeum X, the planet on which the Drifter lost his crew and encountered the unknown creature of Darkness. MrMeep theorizes that the ship doesn’t hold Scorn, but rather these creatures.

Now, I don’t think the broken ship is floating in the Kuiper belt, but rather near Mars or Phobos. It is a Skyburners ship. I do think that  the broken ship can hold or shelter the creatures of Darkness. If the ship is truly overrun by Darkness, I cannot see why there would not be any of these creatures on board. That could be the reason for the Distress Call. And would lead back into MrMeep’s theory about the ship linking to the Redacted Exotic Quest.

***This makes me think that the first frame of the Distress Call is in fact THE Distress Call, an SOS if you will. The rest of the frames can be coordinates of the ship.*** Which means we might not have to translate. That doesn’t stop me though. I am searching for an answer regarding the Cabal language system.

**Possibility of storyline:**

* Calus came into contact with the highly ranked Skyburners and hired them to transport and guard captured Scorn (we have seen Skyburners guard high value targets before).
* The ship collects the Scorn from the Tangled Shore and return to their base near Phobos.
* The Darkness engulfs Mars, Titan, Io and Mercury, and thus the Cassini.
* A Distress Call is send (we know that takes ages as we saw during the time between the Taken King and the Red War).
* Empress Caiatl and Osiris(?) receive the call.
* Meanwhile, rampant scorn and creatures of Darkness overrun the broken ship.

raidsecrets,Strange pillar above the Cosmodrome gangway tower.,"In the recent [Season of the Chosen Trailer](https://youtu.be/_XlFBp_ZmyE?t=71), when showing footage of the reprised Devils Lair strike there is a [strange beam/pillar above the right gangway tower](https://i.imgur.com/ki2AwZG.jpg) (or whatever those towers are) of the colony ship. This is the same tower that we went up during the [Cayde's Stash mission of The Taken King](https://youtu.be/t1oenwa-8lw?t=310)

Anyone have an idea what this thing is? It doesn't make sense to be a physical part of the tower and it terminates somewhere behind the rocket engines so we cannot see the top. I thought maybe some kind of fallen lift/tractor beam but that wouldn't lead anywhere and it is too dark to be that. 

Alternatively it could be some kind of graphical glitch. My best guess is that the elevator shaft from Devil's Spire zone is being incorrectly rendered in The Devils' Lair zone. But even this makes little sense as the [load zone between those areas happens before the elevator room](https://youtu.be/t1oenwa-8lw?t=353). and not during the elevator ride up. This would however explain why the pillar is so high however, as the impostered assets for the colony ship and gangway towers are both really small/short compared to the actual size of those locations.

Anyone have some insight here? Given the Fallen S.A.B.E.R. zones were part of TTK's additions to the Cosmodrome, I think it is feasible that he Devil's Spire bubble, another part of TTK, might be the culprit of this little anomaly, if it does return, I'll be curious as to what they'll do with it.",1612365476,2021-02-03 10:17:56

raidsecrets,The HELM is most likely not in the current tower,"TLDR: The HELM is most likely a separate location in the last city and I believe that it takes place in a small section of the old tower and in season 14 the old tower will get fleshed out. Much like the cosmodrome this season and next season.

This is what the bungie.net post says about the HELM

&gt; The Hub for Emergency Logistics and Maneuvers, or H.E.L.M., is the new base for all current Vanguard operations within the system. From the H.E.L.M. players can interact with the War Table Seasonal vendor, access the Prismatic Recaster, decode Umbral Engrams at the Umbral Decoder, manage their vault, and retrieve items from the Postmaster.

So know a few things here and from the trailer

- The HELM is in fact in the last city, as seen at [0.51 in the trailer](https://youtu.be/_XlFBp_ZmyE)

- The HELM will have a vault AND postmaster 

- Not confirmed but this could be ""New location"" that crow will be at since he can be seen at the end of the trailer with zavala, it would also make sense thats why they didn't specify that it was the current tower

So

I have come to the conclusion that the HELM is in the last city and is a separate location from the current tower because of the vault and post.

Now stick with me, if this is a separate location AND in the last city. Could this location take place in the old tower. I very well know the new tower isn't going anywhere, it can be seen in the trailer and promotional art. However it may be possible that the HELM is a small section of the old tower and next season the old tower gets fleshed out, very much like the cosmodrome this season and next season.

It's environment models that of what we see in the trailer, however it is rotated in the trailer (makes sense, 2 months so marketing team probably didn't want to reveal what was around it that's a dead giveaway) 
So now you might be wondering, what's the dead giveaway? The pipes. As we can see, there are pipes all along the walls, further confirming that there is indeed scorn aboard a Cabal ship.

This in not the case as other screenshot of the helm with a [different angle](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148611/S13_DPS-Banners_HELM.jpg?cv=3983621215&amp;av=3245488895) show a big structure at the same height as the windows. This structure seems to contain stairs in the outside and a ship in the inside making it seem like it could be located closer to the hanger in the current wall. While in the cube map there is nothing at the same height as the windows other than the white pillars.

There is somethings that leaves me wonder as to where exactly the HELM is, as it is shown to be [elevated and able to overlook a location](https://imgur.com/a/qkwk5o9) that I can't make up. This means that is has to be in a high place while still having other tall structures that resemble the wall around it? 

The only thing that I can think of is that maybe they repurpose some of the assets from the cube map that we saw into the current tower or a new social hub (second one is unlikely) as the cube map is known to be quite old (even before shadowkeep).

#*Gameplay-wise*

**What makes it seem like it could be the New (old) Tower?**

[In the image on the Bungie website](https://i.imgur.com/nVLnOt2.png), we can see the H.E.L.M. is on the outskirts of the Last City and it is pretty high up. The craters outside the window also show that it is on the same side of the Last City as the New (old) Tower and the current Tower. The window also lines up well with [the cubemaps that were leaked a few weeks ago](http://montaguem.com/cubemaps?cubemap=environments_57?ver=v2922). It definitely looks like this area has been in development for a while, and while it could have been scrapped content before, it could be brought back into the development pipeline for future.

**Why would Bungie put in the resources to retrofit the Old Tower and bring it back?**

If Bungie wants to go with the Seasonal model, they need to keep the player base happy. A lot of people are nostalgic and have voiced their wants for the Old Tower returning. It would generate a lot of hype in the community, and to Bungie, hype is money.

**It's such a large area, they should put those resources into gameplay. Besides, we still see the current Tower in the Season 13 trailer!**

Well, maybe. Bringing back the Old Tower would take a lot of development time, but it doesn't have to be immediate, it could be baby steps. This season, it's the H.E.L.M., next season it's an armor and blacksmith, the season after it's a hanger, etc. Those baby steps eventually culminate into a full-fledged move from the current tower to the New (old) Tower. This would also be why we still see and will use the current Tower in Season 13 and for the forseeable future for most things, and why we still see cranes around the Old (new) Tower in the trailer.

**Why would we need a New (old) Tower, anyways? There's still more room in the current tower for vendors!**

Because we don't need more room for vendors. We need more room for armies.

---
#*Story-wise*

**Okay, now you're talking out of your ass. What do you mean ""armies""?**

Currently, in the story, we're facing the Darkness coming to destroy the Traveler and we have approximately seven seasons left until the Lightfall. A few seasons ago, we saw the introduction of Mithrax, the leader of the House of Light, and we helped each other assault those loyal to Eramis during the Zero Hour mission. In Season 12, we helped Variks evacuate the fallen in the House of Salvation from the ruins of Riis Reborn, and those Fallen promptly went to join Mithrax in the House of Light on Earth. In the Lore, they never hated us because we were human, they hated us because the ""Great Machine"" (the Traveler) was on our side, not theirs. Eventually, the House of Light was formed because those in it realized this and began to help us and work with us so that they could hopefully fight under the Traveler again.

In Season 13, we see the Caiatl, the current leader of the Cabal. In the trailer, she offers an alliance with Zavala, and Zavala wants the alliance too, or at minimum a truce. Otherwise, why would he bother talking to her? Of course, however, in asking Zavala to bow to her, she doesn't want an alliance, she wants another army at her command. Zavala says no, and that's that. During Season 13, we fight her forces and by the end of it, we prove ourselves as equals to the Cabal, at which point, Caiatl and Zavala agree on an alliance as equals. Enemy Cabal would still be in the game, and they would likely just be those who split from Caiatl and refused to ally with us, ensuring that we aren't losing an enemy type. This would be similar to how the Fallen are effectively split, with House of Light wanting to help us and work with us and other Houses like House Salvation under Eramis who still want to defeat us.

**Why would we want to ally with other races? They've been trying to kill us!**

Because we know the Darkness is coming, and we know we can't stop it alone. The Fallen have already tried, and the Traveler gave up on them. If we are alone, it's entirely possible that we end up like the Fallen, where the Traveler leaves us and we go to another system and fight a new race, where _they_ now have the power of the Traveler, and we just want it back. If we unite, we would likely unite in a new base built for all the different Xeno races, and it would be a common place where all alien forces can come together to plan things. It'd effectively be like a NATO base, but in Destiny, where everyone can come to help the fight in their common enemy: the Darkness. The title of Guardian would no longer just be human Guardians, but rather anyone/anything that fights under the Traveler. The Tower would become a common meeting ground for the Guardians to unite, no matter the race.

---

#*What about the Future?*

**Okay, so let's say we ally with the Fallen and Cabal. What about the Vex and Hive?**

The Hive? Good luck with that.

The Vex? In Destiny 1, the Vex worshipped the Black Heart, which would take control of the Vex in order to fight us. Ikora Rey later hypothesized that the Black Heart was an aspect of Darkness. If this is true, would it be possible to install an aspect of Light from the Traveler into the Black Garden? If we can do something like that, is it possible that the Vex would now fight along side us? In order to keep some Vex as enemies, similar to the Cabal and Fallen, we might have some Vex that are strong enough to resist the Aspect of Light and still do their own bidding.

**What would this mean going into Lightfall?**

Well, with Lightfall being a pretty ominous title, I see it panning out in a couple different ways (assuming the above is true):

* Lightfall will be about the _immediate danger_ that the Darkness presents to the Traveler. We are now fighting the Darkness on the ground, together with our allied forces. It will be all the Guardians (i.e. all humans and aliens fighting under the Light) fighting against anyone under the influence of the Darkness.

* Lightfall is just as the name implies, the fall of the Light and the fall of the Traveler. In uniting all the races to fight against the Darkness, even without the power of the Light, fighting together is now our only chance of actually coming out on top against the Darkness.

I only started playing Destiny again with about a month left in Season of Arrivals, and while I've been super into Destiny since then, I am still not very well-versed with the lore. All of the above was written with my current understanding of the lore and where the lore is currently going, and some things could very well be straight-up wrong. Thoughts and criticisms would be super appreciated!

#*TLDR*
The H.E.L.M. will be a part of the new (old) Tower, similar to how the Annex is part of the current Tower. The old (new) Tower will not be fully introduced in Season 13, but rather will be slowly built leading up to the release of Witch Queen. We will ally with hostile alien races under the Light of the Traveler and work together to defeat the common enemy we all share: the Darkness.",1612307527,2021-02-02 18:12:07

I feel like it's got to be common knowledge (I've been doing it since the beginning of the game) but incase you didn't know, you can use angles in the game to launch yourself with your jump.

You just have to land on a slope (or stairs) and jump at the same time. This works best with a warlock using burst glide as you can increase the speed further with your glide. It works on all classes though.

Below is a video of me doing this in the best place I know of to give a good example.

**Hammer of Proving**

Use the Hammer of Proving to forge and socket Challenger Medallions out of pillaged Cabal Gold for the right to take on Caiatl's fiercest commanders in ritual combat. Visit the War Table at the H.E.L.M. to upgrade your Hammer of Proving through three tiers of pursuits that will unlock Hammer upgrades, new Proving Runes, gear drops, and more.

A few days ago I saw this video by a small YouTube channel called Fatemaker and the Phoenix talking about this topic.

Since the new trailer for season 13 came out I have seen a alot of people discussing about the Screeb at the end of the trailer. What I believe is that the ship at the end of the trailer is one of Calus's ships that has the Scorn on board.

There is also the end of the trailer with a darkened cabal ship and what seems to be a screeb aboard it. My best guess is the scorn coming back and dealing with their ""father"" the crow?

It can be seen on Saladin's platform, opposite side facing the Traveler, although I'm sure it's possible from The Hanger, too- just didn't think to check. Is this new ( possibly powering the Rebuilt Tower ) or I just missed it this whole time? It also glows red during the day. 

( Sounds like it's been there the whole time and I just missed it somehow, no need to reply. )

raidsecrets,EoT RNG math help for the statistically challenged,"There seems to be some intelligent people here that understand statistic, so maybe someone can help me out.  Just for my own curiosity when my fireteam has someone getting bad RNG, I like to figure what the chances are of that happening. As with many others, we are having some bad RNG with EoT. Let's assume a 5% drop rate (not confirmed as far as I know), and I have 31 lootable clears.  I don't have the EoT yet. Chances of that happening are 0.95^31= 0.20, so like 20% chance of that happening, correct?  1 in five.  So actually its should be pretty likely that most raid groups of 6 who have run the raid 3x per week should still have someone looking for it.  

My group still has 3 out of the 6 people looking for it. WE actually had it drop for TWO people on our VERY FIRST CLEAR! After that, 1 more person, and a couple duplicate drops.  It ""feels"" like the RNG is broken (as it always does when you don't get the drops) but I don't know the match to calculate the chances of that actually happening. I'm sure it's not some unbelievably small number, we are just getting unlucky. Since it could be any 3 people out of the original group of 6, I just don't know how to make that math work correctly... And actually I would be more interested in figuring out the chances of 3 or MORE not getting it after X number of runs.  The chances that 3 people would all not get the drop after X number of runs is (.95^x)^3.  But that is a useless statistic, because I would have just cherry picked the 3 people who happened to no get it from a larger group. Since I am starting with a pool of 6, and 0-3 of those could get the drop and still meet the criteria, I don't know how to set up the problem... Been like 20 years since I took a statistics class.",1612214662,2021-02-01 16:24:22

At the back left corner of the campsite, we get to place 5 different things we retrieve from high-rank Eliknsi we kill on Europa: A piece of Praksis’ gear, Phylaks’ scarf, Eramis’ device to control stasis, Kridis’ tooth and Tanik’s head. However, one of them is missing. Between Kridis and Taniks’s pieces, there is a plat with nothing to be put in it. And which is the fallen that is not mentioned? Atraks. Something from Atraks is missing right there and we have no idea where or how to find that something to finish our collection of pieces of slained fallen. 

What do you think ir should be done to get this final piece? Is it in the encounter itself or anywhere in the raid? Is it non-related to the raid an it’s somewhere in places like Riis-reborn?

Freezing them does [not affect Protection of the Warmind](https://imgur.com/a/xZhsw3G), there was no different damage taken values. (Running 40 res)

Freezing them does [not allow them to act like a grenade or frozen enemy](https://imgur.com/a/fwPR599). In fact, you can not damage Warmind cells when slamming.

There is absolutely nothing to gain from freezing Warmind cells, just thought I wanted to share :)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Special Thanks to u/-Schrae- for asking for this, you can now crash your own game...sorta. With some Teletso shots and a warmind cell inside of a duskfield, the particles can cause enough fps dropage that it can crash your game.

Example A: [https://imgur.com/a/yF0bjzk](https://imgur.com/a/yF0bjzk) While the clip is extremely short, I only started recording when I was firing the Telesto shots, I hard crashed D2 right after the Warmind call explosion. I dropped from 147fps to 87fps and the game stopped. I have not been able to replicate this since, even after trying the same thing over and over again, very odd.

raidsecrets,"Shaxx’s Atonement (Concept, Please Read)","(I want to start this off by saying sorry ahead of time. I know this isn’t technically the place to put this, however I want to reach as much of the community as I can, so I’m trying it here as well.)

Shaxx’s Atonement (Concept, Please Read)

To all my fellow creators and lore enthusiasts out there, I have a concept for a short animation that I’ve wanted to put together for a while now, and if anyone else is interested in helping, I genuinely think this is something that could be incredible.

So the idea: The story of this animation would basically be that the Last City/Tower is being attacked, everything is going south, much like what we heard The Bombardment was like. Now, as we’ve heard from Eris and the Drifter, Shaxx’s Ahamkara skull has already planted Savathûn’s song in his head. So in this animation, we’re running with the idea that Shaxx realizes this.

So it begins with Shaxx helping civilians and other guardians escape through the streets of the city, being chased by some unseen creature or entity.  They make their way to the tower, where he meets up with Ikora, Saladin, Osiris, Ana, and an Exo Rasputin. Ikora states how Zavala is nowhere to be found, nor is The Guardian. Shaxx tells them he’s brought the last of his civilians and lost whatever it was that was chasing them, and with this he turns and we see the first shot of the whole city. Pyramids are everywhere.

Saladin states they have to go, he knows when they can’t win, but Ikora says there’s no way they’ll escape with the civilians. All the while, Shaxx is abnormally quiet. The arguing swells until, Shaxx:

“Quiet. I’ll stay”

Everyone disagrees, saying he’ll die, and Shaxx says he knows. Saladin orders him to go with them, and Shaxx refuses. Saladin gets angry at Shaxx for disobeying him again, and asks him to listen just this once. But Shaxx turns and just says, “Please, Saladin. That witch’s hymn has been echoing in my head for some time now. Sometimes I can’t even think over it’s deafening tune. Please, let me atone”

In the end, they have no choice but to leave him, and Shaxx turns to face a rising tide of formless creatures. The helmet comes off, but we never see his face. The last thing we see is Shaxx, a brilliant ball of Arc energy, Thundercrashing against a tidal wave of pure Darkness.

The final shot is Mara, in some distant place, turn and look, almost as if she knows.

Anyways that’s the idea I’ve had, obviously I’d love to tweak it where it needs to be tweaked, especially the dialogue (I know, trust me).

So yea, again to any creators out there, musicians, animators, anyone interested really, I would love to bring this idea to life. If anyone is interested, feel free to message me on Discord. I’m going to try and put together a server to structure the work of this, assuming we get that many people interested anyways. I don’t know if anything like this has been done before, so apologies if it has. Either way, just let me know. 

Discord: Half Empty Bottle of Whiskey#1667

Honestly any help would be appreciated. I just want to show my love for the series, through the highs and lows.

Also any suggestions or thoughts for what should be done would be super appreciated as well, so just lmk down below",1611534433,2021-01-24 19:27:13

Don't know if this actually means anything, but I haven't heard anyone else talking about it so I thought I'd bring it up. I was watching a lore video on the Hawkmoon, and the topic of Crow's dreams came up.  When it was brought up how he was in the form of a hawk in the dreams, it finally clicked in my brain why it sounded familiar. The cutscene from the original Red War campaign that played right after Ghaul captured the traveler. I know people have revisited the scene in the past after certain events came to pass, and it appears that one of Crows dreams line up almost exactly with the cutscene. Like I said, it might not be anything, but to me at least the comparisons were a little too close to be a coincidence.",1611532471,2021-01-24 18:54:31

raidsecrets,Top Tree Dawnblade Heat Rising - Xbox One vs. Series X &amp; PC,"Didn't know this until just recently, but top tree Dawnblade's heat rising on Xbox One doesn't work the same as it does on Xbox Series X. On Series X, if you consume your grenade as you jump, you will float in the air until heat rising finishes (10 seconds). On Xbox One, it will only hold you in the air for about a second, and then you slowly descend. Furthermore, on Series X, if you super at the end of heat rising, you can stay in the air without descending until the super is finished. The way heat rising behaves on Series X is the same as how it works on PC. This is likely due to a frame rate issue. Other bugs like this have been seen as well in the past between console and PC. We only tested Xbox, but it may be similar on PS4 and PS5. \[Video here.\]([https://youtu.be/DYS663Ym9n0](https://youtu.be/DYS663Ym9n0))",1611519573,2021-01-24 15:19:33

If you play on the sticks, it becomes quite noticeable. This weapon has barely been talked out and I feel has been slept on. Cosmology + Catalyst makes for some incredible crowd control capabilities, also to be utilized with Anti-Barrier rounds in Grandmasters, and along with that you have the second shot in the burst effected by Zen Moment that has NO damage falloff and high damage could make for one of the best utility weapons you could use.

---

**Context:** We were proceeding with the Taniks boss fight like normal, were midway through the first damage phase and suddenly wiped. Luckily, one of our fireteam was able to record the wipe (see video above).

* The cause of death for all of us was ""Shared Fate"", which normally occurs if you don't revive a downed teammate.
* We didn't notice during the encounter but, in the bottom-right, the ""Light fading in x:xx"" timer was present, warning us that we needed to ""REVIVE PLAYER"".
* No-one was downed. You can see all six of us on the radar in the top-left alive and well right up until the moment that we wiped from the ""Shared Fate"".

Has this happened to anyone else? Any ideas what causes it?",1611278824,2021-01-21 20:27:04

raidsecrets,Possible function for Ascendant lens.,"With be new twab this week it was said that the prismatic remaster was returning permanently. In addition to this bungie announced that a prismatic lens could be used to focus loot on what a player wants.
My theory is that:

The ascendant lens will be used in conjunction with the recaster to focus into some new dreaming city themed gear.

The seasonal content hasn't been revealed yet, and I think it could involve dreaming city. This leads me to my next theory being:

The ascendant lens will be used to locate the oracles within the last wish raid.

Oracles were heard/seen in the last wish raid at the start of season of the hunt. And could be used to locate and shoot to activate a quest. Similar to the template encounter. (Maybe exotic quest) but most likely not. Maybe even wish 15.

I found this while I was looking for a possible ""Sixth Feather"" location and, while there isn't a feather there, it makes for a very good safe spot during the Harbinger's ""Survive"" section. 

* Pretty much the entire platform can be stood on so there's more than enough space if you needed to duck back for cover, but if you go to the far back edge then it will cause ""Joining Allies"" to appear.

* About 70-80% of the arena can be seen from the platform (the best view is obtained from walking along the front edge as far back from the centre of the arena as possible without triggering ""Joining Allies"")",1611254376,2021-01-21 13:39:36

Then wait until the door opens and just do the thing like u/downpour610 did. 
After that you can still spawn your own Sparrow after you got the Glitch/Bug to be faster and thats it. And its much better and faster for a raid team it saves much more time.",1611096156,2021-01-19 17:42:36

Witch - Before entering the room to fight there is a lever on the wall that opens the gate to the cage and you can collect the feather.

Centurion - on the highest catwalk in the room where you fight the centurion after it flees

Captain - on the top level of the little resevoir room you have to climb to get to the captain

There are also two other spots in the Hollow on your way to the final encounter both in the area leading up to it. One should be in a well lit up area with a few taken enemies after you exit the small room with the acolytes in it into the big room with the chasm.

[For context](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/k7z095/something_new_in_the_edz_not_related_to_hawkmoon/) \- About a month ago, I made a post discussing this ""Hidden Village"" of sorts outside of the Reservoir. See the linked reddit post for relevant links and discussions.

* TL:DR - A seemingly obscure and random area far out of the box was changed significantly with the launch of Beyond Light. The area in question is where we now find this ""village"". Originally, it was just a [peculiar texture outside of the box](https://imgur.com/a/pdbprSx), but it is now an (although intangible) fairly textured set of aged and broken down buildings along with a pretty interesting bridge. Before the [Ship area in The Reservoir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUnqOpKQoeE) was accessible, there was a penalty box below that area. This penalty box would [teleport you out of the box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vrtVodekuM), allowing you to access this area. This penalty box is now gone, with the ability to teleport outside the box going with it.

Still, I have no idea if this could have any ramifications for something in the future. This is such a seemingly random change to a very random area, but one that seems to be very intentional. With all of the recently discovered areas in the Reservoir, I wouldn't call it impossible for something else to pop up there that we don't yet know about.",1611072905,2021-01-19 11:15:05
raidsecrets,Acquiring the Augment Buff for a directly previous Week (Scanner Aguments),"Video:  
[https://youtu.be/10qZR4UtVdY](https://youtu.be/10qZR4UtVdY)

I would hope it is common knowledge that you can pick up the augment buff from Variks towards the end of the week and complete it the following week. This trick is picking it up and completing the previous week's agument.

What you Need:  
An Old instance (held from a previous week, so has to be done at reset), and a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to preform this trick, have your friend hold the old instance of the given eclipsed zone (most useful if you are attempting to get an extra in for either Eventide Ruins or Cadmus Ridge), while you sit in orbit. When reset hits, join on them and fast travel to Charons Crossing, purchase the item from Variks that allows you to pick up the buff, and then travel by sparrow back to your friend. Once you have the item from Variks, kill the Scanner Vandal, and you will be able to pick up the scanner from the previous week's eclipsed zone with the current week's item purchase from Variks.

Once you have the scanner buff, DO NOT DIE FOR ANY REASON, this will remove the buff from your character and force you to pick it up again, which could cause issues with your ability to complete augments.

&amp;#x200B;

Detailed Explanation on why this works (and why the completing the following week works as well):  
The Augment ""buff"" has 3 Stages to it. First is the Item you purchase from Variks, which gets consumed immediately. This can be purchased once per week per account, and is not affected by anything outside of itself. Second is the Signal Buff in your inventory, this lasts for 7 Days, and allows you to pick up the scanner buff in patrol from the slain scanner vandal, this buff does not do checks on the week it was acquired or when it was used, it only makes you eligible to pick up a scanner buff. Third is the ""\_\_\_\_ Sectors x3"" buff that you see on the right side of your screen, this is acquired by picking up the scanner in patrol, and only checks where it was picked up, so if you have an old instance of Eventide Ruins, it doesn't care if the ""current"" eclipsed zone is Asterion Abyss.  


Sorry I took so long to upload and post this, I was super lazy the past 2 weeks, thought it might help anyone who would be up at reset this week.",1611053883,2021-01-19 05:58:03

So I’m beginning to wonder the likelihood that Crow will find out that he was Uldren Sov and what would happen if he does.",1610912287,2021-01-17 14:38:07

raidsecrets,Out of bounds the crashed Morningstar while still in Orbit?,"Obligatory first time posting, etc. 

I don't know if this is anything new or if I've just missed it being posted, but I unexpectedly got into an out of bounds I've never seen before. I was attempting to get into Restricted like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf5Nb50Wezw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf5Nb50Wezw). I've never had an issue getting this to work until yesterday, when I was a bit slow and ended up attempting to slide into Clarity Control right as the Morningstar crashed. 

Instead of surviving the crash and the game now recognizing me as in Clarity Control like it should have per the above video, as soon as I slid I died of a misadventure. I expected to be respawned at Taniks with the rest of my team, but instead I was spawned in an area of Clarity Control I've never seen before. It looks like the crashed Morningstar, however it was still in Europa's orbit. I could walk around mostly freely out of bounds and when I fell down, I was nearly directly above the Winnower statue. I hit a couple of invisible boundaries down there and couldn't get into the room with the statue, but could walk around mostly freely atop near the Atraks encounter. 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to explore nearly as much as I wanted to because our team was on a pretty tight schedule, but I'm going to try to replicate this if I can whenever we raid next. In the meantime, has anyone else experienced this? 

I apologize, I'm not very knowledgable when it comes to streaming/video uploading and the such so the only recording I have is a very short stream found here - [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/873004625](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/873004625). (You can very well skip the last like five minutes because it's just me trying to get a screenshot and failing.) If this isn't acceptable I can look into figuring out how to save it and upload to youtube or something else, but I just wanted to post this before I forgot. 

If this isn't anything new I apologize! I've personally just never seen this before and I try to keep myself up to date with the out of bounds and such to mess with my teammates haha.",1610649449,2021-01-14 13:37:29

\- You can shoot the balls before and after the cube encounter. Which again makes me wonder if there is an way to unlock something if you shot different balls in a different way or something like that  


\- Also, At the first encounter we can see a progression of the balls, some have metal plates on them, some dosen't but you can see every ball from above if you go to the encounter. Can this lead to some sort of a puzzle and the map could be an hint to it? Btw, the ""map"" was found in the dark room right after you open 2nd door. Where you can find urn 3 for the triumph 

\- Why are the urns there if the triumph is not on anymore?

\- What are the glowy sprial above mars, io, titan and mercury before the cube? We can also see one in the nine's room along with the lights that we can spot in different locations in the darkness.

Idk why but there might be something hidden in there.. even if it is an old dungeon..  
If you have any answers please let me know and I just want you to know that I am not that old in the puzzles and stuff, just wondering if there could possible be something. Have a great day guys",1610637149,2021-01-14 10:12:29

raidsecrets,Salvation's Grip Breach in the Hawkmoon Fireplace Area,"Potential Spoilers about the Hawkmoon fireplace area

I couldn't find anything here about this yet so apologies if someone already did this and this is already known. I was able to breach the door in the secret hawkmoon fireplace area. It appears to only be a small hallway that leads to an invisible wall that would spit you out of a window by the start of the reservoir. I was killed by a death barrier in a random corner by the door so i couldn't explore more. (Not that there was much to see anyway) Check the link for pics n stuff.

raidsecrets,Weapon Spreadsheet Updated for S13,"Hello all remember me, and the spreadsheet that I made prior to Beyond Light? The spreadsheet that focused on getting your weapons prepped for the sunset upcoming?  


Well I am happy to report that I am continuing on updating the sheet, and make it viable for every season hence forth. Until, well some app comes along, and makes it obsolete.   


Link to the Sheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnSQjqBqEqBQY3R203V5Y5b0il4gSeOIiPlsJfEErGfztmx9BHxzBA9wPlFo8oFMHNOddqrjpmx-hZ/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnSQjqBqEqBQY3R203V5Y5b0il4gSeOIiPlsJfEErGfztmx9BHxzBA9wPlFo8oFMHNOddqrjpmx-hZ/pubhtml) 

&amp;#x200B;

Small tweaks to it:  
\-- I have added all the Beyond Light expansion, DSC Raid, and Season of the Hunt weapons to the sheet so they can be hunted respectively to prep your vaults.  
\-- Added all the new exotics, associated quest, and catalyst if applicable that was added in Beyond Light/Season of the Hunt.  
\--Added a new sheet that will be updated towards the end of the season of weapons that will no longer be end game viable so its easier to prune them vaults.  


Per some questions that will be asked:  


\-- Hawkmoon does not have recommended perks since it would make the page longer than need be. Personally, I would recommend maximizing its handling, and using a perk for range/stability. I am going for Small Bore, Alloy Mag(Default), Surplus, and Heavy Grip.  
\-- Nothing really changed information wise. I kinda like the current state, and only really need to add/remove weapons when applicable.  
\-- Still no numbers cause I like science, experimentation, and encourage all to do the same.  
\-- I will update the sheet closer to the end of every season when prep begins for most of the community, or when I feel like getting around to it.  
\-- Feel free to continue to provide feedback, and if there are any weapons I missed be sure to let me know. As well as share it willingly with the creditation applied!  


Thank you for checking it out prior to Beyond Light it meant alot to me! &lt;3",1610616233,2021-01-14 04:23:53

I was wandering oob in the resevoir area to see if I could figure out how to get past the barriers without communing with the light. I followed the path with the ""doorway"" we don't have access to yet and found a giant room with what looks to be generators. I kept going along the opposite side and there was an indicator on the mini map that there were enemies spawned ahead so I followed it and found 1 solo taken goblin just chilling on the edge of a solid area. I approached it and it attacked me so I killed it. Nothing seemed to happen and it wasn't like the placeholder Atraks that took minimal damage without showing numbers. It died just like normal. I killed it with Hawkmoon just in case as well.

raidsecrets,Tire Game Perfect Score w/ Salvation's Grip,"Someone had previously posted something similar on this, but I can't find the post. I tried multiple searches. That person showed a video using Salvation's Grip to get a perfect score on the tire game on the moon. However, he said he could not replicate it, and others could not either. Well I did it! I saw someone playing the tire game, and went over and shot my salvation's grip on his game. Even though he wasn't getting the tires in the middle, I noticed at the end that it said near perfect score. So I thought I'd play myself and try a few things to see if I could do what I saw in the previous video. It was not tied to a specific game instance because I did go to orbit, and come back.

&amp;nbsp;

My strategy was to push the tires off in front, the direction they should be going. As soon as I pushed them, I would shoot the salvation's grip shot. Do it after every tire. You need to be able to reload and spam the shot to be able to do this. Hit the middle each time, and at the end it should tell you that you got the perfect score. It took me a few tries to get this. Sometimes it would only say I got a near perfect score (timing must have been slightly off). You'll see in my video that the tires actually go in to the craters that are not in the center, but it still gives a perfect score.

I believe, based on other users' posts, that this could be the entrance for the upcoming return to the Vault of Glass.

&amp;#x200B;

While exploring OOB in the Chamber of Water, I found a random Vex portal or cannon hanging out above some far out platforms leading to what looks like the sun. Without zooming in, it looks as if there are some circular patterns around it that could be interpreted as a large vex gate. I was trying to think of any location that this could be of use, but couldn't come up with anything off the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Unrelated to the portal/cannon, there is also a rather large platform that you can reach outside of the Chamber of Water that you freely walk around on without any weird clipping or textures missing. It's very detailed, moreso than just some random ""filler"" background.

raidsecrets,Crouch Jumping with Stasis,"Crouching in air is a real rarity in Destiny 2. For whatever reason, Bungie has decided that Guardians can't lift up their legs in the air. Instead, we have to rely on abilities, mostly Code of the Missile, to sneak into tight places in the air.

However, recently Bungie made a mistake. They patched the base form of the Salvation's Grip Breach, and in doing so, they locked our crouch/uncrouch state while inside an ice shard. I don't think it's currently well known that this gives us our first true crouch jump in Destiny 2.

How useful is this?

There are many cases where there are small areas you'd want to get into, but can't because you'd need to crouch. Most of the time, you can just place your own ice shard and crouch on that. However, that isn't always possible. Perhaps there isn't space for ice below the hole you want to jump in, or ice can't stick around precisely at the right height. You can just cover the spot with ice, and then crouch jump into it. I foresee it potentially being useful for a small vent, like something a lost sector return path might use. Certainly a very niche tool.

See a toy example here: [https://youtu.be/0wUsEQk5J2M](https://youtu.be/0wUsEQk5J2M)

raidsecrets,What I've gathered pertaining to the reservoir/ hawkmoon area.,"Firstly, there are two doors in the area that contain enemies but are currently closed: one to the room in the left before the taken wizard, and one on the left near the bottom in the 3 story room before the bosses. These could be connected however it is uncurrently unclear to me if they are. Shooting them with hawkmoon yields no result.

Secondly, while the room kinda looks like the lake of shadows boss room at a first glance, it is not. from observation I can almost confirm that room is above us, and as I'm not good at breaching, the taken barrier to the left is currently unaccesible to me due again to my lack of ability to breach,  maybe tied to doors I spoke of earlier as it turns back towards that direction.

Third, behind the ship under the walk way there appears to be an odd silvery texture on the panels next to the stairs, again shooting with hawkmoon yielded no result.

Nothing odd about the ship. 

Nothing of note in the ""hallowed rift"" area, though it just seems like a zone change that will contain a taken portal at a later date.

It is of note in the boss room that the ""storm"" around the shard of the traveller is very well visible.

On to the recently discovered ""fireplace hallway"".

The closed doors in the surrounding area do nothing when shot with hawkmoon. There is a sort of lever to your left as you go in with a flashing blue light, and what appears to be an ""off"" green light above it.  From what I can see there is nothing else of valuable note here besides for the laptop at the very end.

On to the hallowed grove:nothing strange noted.

This is by no means meant to be a list of everything on the areas pertaining to hawkmoon, but some observations I've made on the trips into these areas. If you would like to add anything feel free.",1610524734,2021-01-13 02:58:54

I tried following them and to my surprise, they had a timer on them that covered them in the same dark damaging liquid that you see in a lot of other Dreaming City content, quite likely in order to make it easier to make a mistake and get sent back to the start of the now revealed jump puzzle.

After about 3 platforms, a new objective marker will appear. However, in my hurry due to the damaging platforms and in a panic due to the ABYSMAL vision during the puzzle, i messed up and ended up starting the last phase of the High Celebrant fight and had to watch as the objective marker, clearly pointing elsewhere, faded.

I ended up completing the mission and am now locked out from trying again for the week. Can anyone else try and confirm/finish what i started? I haven't found anything about this yet. Forgive my lack of evidence, i'm not yet in the habit of taking screenshots.

I talked about it on my Youtube channel, looked through +10 gameplays going through the same room and only found another one passing by the shadow (it's the video from Esoterikk showing the penguin locations), and recently, one of my subscribers sent me a clip recorded with his phone, showing a better look at the monster/ shadow: [https://twitter.com/TheWildGamer95/status/1347880550787395584](https://twitter.com/TheWildGamer95/status/1347880550787395584)  


It looks like 2 shadows, one of which seems to ""attack"" the other one, and ""ride"" it. Or something similar. We can speculate what they could be doing but in my personal opinion, they doesn't seem to be anything we've seen. Let me know your what you think!

i start with suppressor, whatever side the operator is on/goes to is the side i will finish suppressing on, as the timings are not possible without finishing besides it. i deposit buff after i finish, and grab operator quickly, a late pickup will cause the operator to get deactivated before you pick it up. if done correctly you will have about 3 seconds to get positioned to grab nukes before all 3 spawn. i then shoot one of the FAR panels (in hope to make the nukes spawn in both catwalks, i grab the closest nuke on my side, and take a chance at the close deposit on the current side. if correct, i grab the second nuke and oob with it, making the phases a little bit longer, but also activating the scanner glitch where an extra spot can be deposited in, while i have only gotten to the second phase. i have not been able to verify if you can do the glitch twice to make it 100% chance at every dunk spot, once i finish a normal round without oob, i oob with operator, as it will always be deactivated (suppressor is in terminal, scan is still on vandal) once im back up, i rinse and repeat, grab sup from terminal, start on opposite side of operator vandal, stun, and dunk. this is just a theory, most of the mechanics can be done with skill, while the nuke spawn locations are RNG based, making the solo statistically improbable.",1610125762,2021-01-08 12:09:22

raidsecrets,How to get 100% success rate on completing the High Celebrant mission.,"Hey, I have no idea if this has been mentioned before, but Bungie's recommendation was pretty vague in my opinion so I thought I'd test a few things to see what was causing the locks in progression. Also hopefully dispelling a few theories going around. (All streamable links were done in one run. Just had to split it up due to the websites 500MB limit)

https://streamable.com/un93or

This first bit is where I see the most hang-ups. The key point here is that you should **NOT** shoot him when he teleports beneath that rock archway. The same location as the Portal. After he has disappeared, you're free to shoot the portal. You don't have to wait for the mission objective to change nor do you need that ""burst damage"" or w.e people were saying with Shotguns. Aside from that, as long as you don't kill him, you can damage him as much as you want.

https://streamable.com/shswwf

Same point here tbh. Just do **NOT** shoot him when he teleports away, again, same place as where the portal spawns. After he disappears, shoot away. No need to wait for mission objective to change.

https://streamable.com/l2x1et

Idk if people get locked out here, tbh. Haven't seen it happen. Just thought I'd put this in as well just so people can watch it. I bursted him down super quickly and it was fine. Idk what happens if you kill him before he goes down on that knee though.

https://imgur.com/jTLnnuP

Did this around 8-10 times to get the ship and never bugged out. From what I've noticed, it just seems like you shouldn't hurt him as he's spawning the portal. That simple.

Since beyond light was delayed festival of the lost was is season of arrivals and we got the ascendant lens then from spider for no reason(at the time). If the festival of the lost was in season of the hunt then it would make sense. 

So I’m definitely not the first to say this but the ascendant lens probably is involved in finding the secret exotic. I’ve seen people oob into a platform in the EDZ that looks like it is in the queens court or something.

1. The very first time I did the raid, we did it the ""normal way"" where the operator goes down, scanner picks up buff on dark, calls out the terminals for the operator to shoot, passes the buff over to the light side and repeat, operator sends buff up and scanner buff sent down.

2. I then come across this other method while farming spoils, where someone glitches out of the map and you end up with the operator and scanner both downstairs together....

3. Yet a 3rd method was the scanner staying up stairs but moves between the dark and light rooms while the operator shoots the panel to open the doors for the scanner...

For 3, I wasn't sure exactly how this was done but I'm assuming that the operator stays upstairs until the scanner scans both dark and light sides, and then the operator proceeds to head downstairs, shoots the panels, buffs are swapped, etc

I think 2 and 3 seemed to be the more straightforward method but...I wasn't really sure how 3 was done...

Does the 1minute timer before the basement is set on fire not start until the operator actually goes down there? That's the only way I could think of for doing method 3...",1609817692,2021-01-04 22:34:52
raidsecrets,"Using Destiny Datasets (DestinySets), I think I'm able to see which exotic catalysts are placeholders, and which ones will appear in-game sooner rather than later.","I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole when looking at DestinySets while drinking a beer, as one does, and for whatever reason started to look at Exotic Catalysts in the database and noticed something strange.

When we look at the catalysts that we know are in the game because we can acquire them, the symbols representing the catalysts in the API look like the gun itself. These are the symbols that pop up when your masterwork objective is complete, or when they're in your Quests tab. 

**Examples below:**

**Trinity Ghoul**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3457865914](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3457865914)

**MIDA-Multi Tool**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3466057365](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:3466057365)

**Whisper of the Worm**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732814938](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732814938)

**Crimson**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1783582993](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1783582993)

You can also see what I'm calling placeholder catalysts -- they aren't ""fake"" per se -- after all, they exist in the API. But the icon looks like a trace rifle (the same icon as Coldheart) and look nothing like the gun that the catalyst is referencing. 

My bet is not necessarily that these catalysts won't ever drop, but -- at the very least -- they're not going to drop any time soon, relative to the next batch of catalysts (coming soon!)

**Examples below of some of the weapons the community's been more vocal about catalysts for** (sorry, dudes)

**One-Thousand Voices**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:82994288](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:82994288)

**Anarchy**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1178660677](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1178660677)

There's a third class of exotic weapons --- those that have iconography that look like their respective weapons, but haven't shown up in the game yet.

**Here's a list (and links) to those weapons.** Some of these have been guessed based on a post (that I can't find right now) where icons of exotic weapons were revealed in some sort of image prior to the release of Beyond Light. 

**Heir Apparent**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1324556594](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1324556594)

**Devil's Ruin**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732252706](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2732252706)

**Bastion**: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:4273298922](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:4273298922)

Other oddities:

The catalyst for **Eyes of Tomorrow** has a icon of its own that appears to be classified: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2835258088](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2835258088)

**Deathbringer** is listed as ""No Name"", but has its own icon: [https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1298151900](https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1298151900)

SHORT VERSION (tl;dr or whatever)

We may be seeing catalysts for **Heir Apparent, Devil's Ruin, Traveler's Chosen, Deathbringer &amp; Bastion** sooner than later. The rest of the exotic weapons that currently do not have catalysts are all treated equally within Bungie's API.

FWIW: As a trace rifle, it's hard to say if a **Wavesplitter** catalyst exists, or is simply a placeholder.",1609812858,2021-01-04 21:14:18

raidsecrets,Iron Temple Reflections in the Chamber of Starlight have changed.,"Hey all,

My brother recently made a YouTube video regarding the reflections in the puddles in the Chamber of Starlight of the dreaming city. 

Here’s the link if you’d like to watch for yourself : https://youtu.be/m1PnnKMgics

For those that’d rather read, the puddles in the Chamber of Starlight have never reflected the surrounding areas of the Lost Sector. They have always been essentially Windows to other areas of the world. Prior to Beyond Light, a particular puddle showed the Iron Temple, which is odd because clearly the temple doesn’t reside on the Dreaming City, nor is it even in D2. Could this possible be pertaining to the Ascendant Lens? Furthermore, why has the reflection changed? 

Would love to know your thoughts and see if anyone could look into this. I highly recommend watching the video for a more thorough explanation.",1609716056,2021-01-03 18:20:56

Unfortunately I run out of time and I couldn’t take a picture or explore more.

raidsecrets,Theorie | Destinys Future: Season 12 + upcoming year,"So guys it got a Theorie down here which will could be pretty interesting.

little disclaimer: i know some things could just be foil hat thinking but... who knows. I had i just fun thinking  what could come next.

(I will separate it in different parts)

1. Things happening now: You are all aware of the awful dawning event present. It was trash but we didnt get an exotic weapon. For me that means that there is still a new secret exotic or something coming in the Future. 
Additionally there is this thing with secrets on europa couldnt that be Linked to that. I know there is mich spinfoiling but what if there will be something. I mean there is so much on Europa. I just mean Clovis Bray, the Stranger, darkness, eclipsed zones, lore secret things. There would be such a great potential to make something like a secret as a developer. The last time we got a weekly Rotation of the overworld After the raid was completed with a cutscene there were many things left. I know its not forsaken but there still many things left and because of the Community bungie is less teasing the content because of some events in the past (corridors of time... with a crazy unknown reward! -.-).

2. Future story of destiny:
Disclaimer everything what is know coming is just some thoughts i had because i thought... mhh yeah... that would make sense you know?

Ok, lets Start. 

You should know that we are fighting xivu arath this season (her i forget the name thing which Killed sagira) and we know we are getting Savathun next year AND ON TOP OF THAT we know that the dreaming city will come to an end in this year (Multiple reasons: like uldren, mara, upcoming seasons, maybe sunset in a year).
We are getting a 100% a raid with witch queen and we know we released riven who granted a last wish to the queen (savathun). This would fit pretty good.
But who is the queen and how are we going to meet her?. THATS THE POINT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE WONT FIGHT SAVATHUN IN WITCH QUEEN. I mean could be really possible that we will fight her, the title already says. But if you would Think a little bit more you would notice there is more. Savathun tried to Interefere and wanted to stop us talking with the darkness in Season of Arrival. Savathun has her power from the darkness too so maybe the darkness slapped her ass for doing that(correct me if i am wir but a friend of mine talked of something like this but i cant remember if it was his thoughts or the grimoire he bought). So Savathun could come to our side and fulfill her Bigger plans (and teach us hive magic as a darkness subclass as well).
Another point why i think that savathun will least not be the raid or story Boss of the witch queen campaign is Xivu Arath. He is also a Hive God. I dont think that we just going to Kill him in a 8min season mission in some months so there has to be a raid with him. This whole year (seasons) could be the introduction of Xivu Arath as a whole and we learn more about savathun. But the point is... the two siblings wont get together in witch queen. Its known that the whole Osmium Trio of Oryx, Savthun and Xivu Arath arent so good friends(additionally they are going conpletely different paths). If Xivu and Sava dont come together on the same boot or somewho habe similar plans, they wont be friends either in witch queen. Therefore i think they wont do a raid WITH 2 HIVE GODS in it and also not a simple season mission to Kill Xivu Arath a HIVE GOD.

I could also come completely different that savathun is still our enemy and Xivu arath will Follow us until light fall. But i dont Think that. I think she will use us to get rid of her Sibling and fulfill her bigger plans with the Power the medley we heard a whole year...

raidsecrets,Create warmind cells with witherhoard (and maybe anarchy),"I was running the decent encounter with witherhoard and the ikelos smg on a warmind cell build and I noticed that witherhoard would create warmind cells. Doing some testing, it appears that if witherhoards damage area kills an enemy while you are holding an ikelos or seraph weapon, the witherhoard kill counts as a warmind cell generating kill.

I have not tested this with anarchy yet, or other weapons that have dayed kills to get to the source of the glitch, but all I do know so far is that the damage area on the ground can create warmind cells if you are holding an ikelos/seraph weapon.

If anyone tests this further put your results in the replies and I will eventually add more details to this post. 

Tldr: shoot a shot from witherhoard and immediately swap to a seraph/ikelos weapon, kills from witherhoard count as seraph/ikelos weapon kills while you are holding the ikelos/seraph weapon.",1609641636,2021-01-02 21:40:36

raidsecrets,Getting into the traveler shard in the dark forest + weird pull,"As a normal OOBer does I was just chilling in the dark forest ramming my head against the wall when I noticed [this weird tunnel](https://imgur.com/gallery/6qgS8Ax) that doesn't connect to anywhere else. I tried banging my head against the wall of the barrier and to my surprise it [actually worked](https://youtu.be/PNHLWY1TVhs), From here it was just a process of [climbing up](https://youtu.be/dfL5ZtoyRpc) and doing the [res glitch](https://youtu.be/pgFYwXB50XU) with a few friends and your in!

once we got in we set our sights on the final goal of the traveler shard, we knew it was close by but the dark alliance area was surrounded by barriers. after a while I was just messing around when I [hit a push barrier and went really fast](https://youtu.be/OhfpAixB7R8), now at this point I thought it was some weird pull so I went back to try and hit it again before [realizing](https://youtu.be/1k_Rph-zjgY) that I was below the death barrier for the dark alliance area.

I tried again and [found the shard just vibin up there](https://youtu.be/qzJ1m64pOqs). A couple of attempts later and I found our [salvation](https://youtu.be/7DwtqLGM4aY), the stick of [pain](https://youtu.be/IXDhZeWE6wM). Because i'm an absolute idiot I forgot to shadow play it but once your on the stick you can thundercrash to a [higher spot](https://youtu.be/vwQ5ccpYEl0). once your up here there's a couple other areas you can stand on as well. biggest thing to note is that there a a bunch of decent crouch spots here that may be useful.

Once I got up here u/Froggy618157725 and u/CriesOfeternity had just hopped off as we had been doing this whole thing for about 4 hours. I was about to hop off aswell so as a last ditch effort I tried the res glitch solo. The thing about doing it solo is that its MUCH MUCH harder than with a friend as you have to hope you actually get respawned in the place you want AND you basically have to get it first try or bang your head against the wall for 3 more hours. I guess that today was my luckiest day of 2021 because I hit it [solo](https://youtu.be/Y5QR5m5Ha8M).

From here if you go [high up](https://youtu.be/E60MjSM1N6c) and to the left you can land on a new? piece of land and get pulled by something [very strange](https://youtu.be/YXiRbSWnjyk).

At this point one has to ask, ""why is any of this possible?"" well my idea is that the cave we saw at the very start of this OOB adventure was actually supposed to connect the two dark alliance areas together as it connects very neatly the two, there's [push back barriers](https://youtu.be/nqRYR7PiQwM) on both sides of the cave and a [hole](https://youtu.be/p9_bHeRhxvw) on top of it. To me its also the only reasonable explanation as why else would we be able to go to it and climb up if not that it was cut content.

big spinfoil for me here but I also believe that at some point the devs wanted to connect the Dark alliance area with the shard of the traveler. this is because the only way we can get to the shard is by following the weird hill path with again more pushback barriers on both sides very similar to the cave.

special shoutout and thanks to u/Froggy618157725 and u/CriesOfeternity for helping me out with the whole thing as it wouldn't be possible without them. if anyone wants to try and do this for themselves then here's the full [route](https://youtu.be/n3ikjDX0Q7g) minus getting on the stick and another [route](https://youtu.be/mICg3kTdNZc) going from the cave up to the dark alliance first area.",1609567211,2021-01-02 01:00:11

So maybe this is the end of Expansion cutscene? A tease like uldren sov for forsaken, and the eris morn corruption scene perhaps? 

If anyone has theories... maybe some datamined info...

I could very well see this being the season 13 link... maybe this fallen is ""chosen"" for something and that is how season of the chosen starts...

Maybe somo sort of finale to the secrets of europa...

raidsecrets,"Strange humming, ice cracks, and growls on europa","DISCLAIMER: Not sure if this has been posted i tried to scour through and find a post but couldn’t find any so hopefully i didnt gloss over it.


I was patrolling Europa to get some screenshots and my last stop was the pyramid by the exo stranger. After sitting for awhile I noticed some humming so i turned off music and kept listening. After staying for awhile more types of sounds occured like ice cracking and some growling coming the big ravine.

I also went to other locations like cadmus ridge and eventide but there was not the same sounds. And if you walk back towards the stranger the sounds stop until you get to the ravine again

Could be nothing but ambience and ice is known to make weird noises when it cracks so maybe its some bungie audio magic. But the growls left me questioning if something is down there. Maybe it could be the same type of easter egg as titan with the giant hive worm swimming. 

Let me know what you think!

I had varying levels of success being able to do it with

and even [dying by sparrow and then changing my frames to 30 to get revived](https://youtu.be/YSxS9PWL2aA)

In all honesty I think the only thing that matters is staying in crouch only spots so that game is forced to spawn you uncrouched in a crouch only position. Framerate might have a chance to help/hinder you but its so RNG that its hard to tell. For me I got it 1/10 times I tried while  [u/Froggy618157725](https://www.reddit.com/user/Froggy618157725/) never got it once in the hour that we tried.

I also think how high your rez is can effect where you get spawned as [sometimes you just get spawned above](https://youtu.be/CVrconnlQQY) without having to do anything

raidsecrets,Extremely late theory I have for Wish 15,"Here’s this post from someone who has more information: https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/jyf9af/deep_stone_crypt_raid_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

So it turns out that this was sitting in my drafts for a few weeks and I hadn’t posted it, so that’s cool. Also, seeing how wordy I had written this I have put a 5 word summary at the very bottom of this post.

As many are aware the theories of how to find Wish 15 for the Last Wish raid have begun to uprise again (see the post above if you haven’t already). With this I’ve decided to try and jump back in and I think I’ve figured out a few things. These are things that I just thought of recently but I wouldn’t doubt that some other people have had these theories before, but in case not here’s what I came up with.

One of the things that I recently figured out is that we likely need to use the symbols to tell a story of the wish. In the lore for the Titan armor piece Helm of the Great Hunt, the lore has dialogue from Riven which says “What [the Queen] wants, the Techeun move worlds to obtain. And so the Witches devise an impossible machine that speaks a visual language with very few spaces between its words. This machine speaks [wishes]. Makes [bargains]”. The idea that the symbols are used as a visual language kind of reminded me of Native American totem poles. From what I remember, the totem poles carved by the Native Americans show carvings of several different animals in a way that tells a story. I would also like to say that the designs of the hawk symbols in the Last Wish raid do look relatively similar to Native American artworks of birds. Looking at most of the wishes that we currently have it’s hard to say how the symbol patterns tell a relating story, but at least one is pretty obvious to me. 

Wish number 9 is the wish that adds dialogue from Failsafe throughout the raid when you make the wish, the wish is a very simple input using only the six wish plates in the center of the Wall, the wish input involves a Bird2 symbol in the bottom right of the section of six and the other five involve a Fish2 symbol in each of them. From my own guess, the way the fish is seen on the symbol makes me think it’s a dead fish, which lead me to think that the fish symbols represent the 5 dead crew mates that were aboard the Exodus Black, and the one hawk symbol is meant to represent Failsafe(with the hawk having a stern and practically emotionless face which shows that Failsafe has suppressed her sorrow of her dead crew, this might be a stretch though). As for how to interpret the other wishes we have I’m not sure, but I think that this is something to go along. I would also like to say that the mission where you find Failsafe’s crew is called “O Captain”, and as we all know everything in the raid revolves around the phrase “O _______ mine”, so we may need to find a few other links.

If anyone else has other ideas or theories I would like to hear them in comments. And if anyone is going to try and look into the totem pole idea further, thank you and I wish you luck :). This entire thing has just bugged me for so long and I want to see it solved some day, so I’m hoping this might lead to something. Good luck everyone!

A couple of my friends were running the 1280 Lost Sector (Bunker E15) earlier on to farm Essense of Dawning. Right at the end, one of them had an internet connection issue and got booted to orbit. The other one opened the chest and received the triumph ""Solo Lost Sector Mastery"" (Complete any Europa Lost Sector on Master difficulty without a fireteam) plus an Exotic helmet.

---

###How to perform the glitch:

1. As a fireteam (2-3 people), enter the 1280 Lost Sector on Europa (today it is Bunker E15).
2. Complete the Lost Sector (i.e. reach and defeat the final boss). **Do not open the final chest!**
3. All but one player leaves the fireteam and returns to orbit, leaving one player remaining in the Lost Sector.
4. The remaining player opens the final chest.
 * If they have not yet obtained the ""Solo Lost Sector Mastery"" triumph, they should obtain this.
 * They should also have a chance to obtain whichever of the Exotics are available.

This can then be repeated as needed. :)

raidsecrets,Less confusing Of All Trades,"I’m sure most of us have seen some videos, read some strategies, and run this weeks DSC challenge. My clan and I had theorized the challenge weeks ago and came up with our game plan. I think it’s easier than everything else I’ve seen so far. The video is from a clanmate’s perspective. I’m not new to this community, but I did create a new account to rep my clan.

Key points:
Three teams of two.

One from each team always picks up the augment first and guides their team with the other being in the backup role for their team.

Move left to right across the room: operator -&gt; scanner -&gt; suppressor.

Backup roles deposit nukes, so make sure you have designated spots for them ahead of time. How you do that is up to you. We have operator on far left, backup operator left catwalk, backup scanner right catwalk, and backup suppressor far right. Operator always shoots the leftmost nuke.

With the method we used, no chart is needed, nobody needs to know what phase you’re on, it just moves along naturally.

We didn’t plan out swapping buffs, but I think it should be suppressor first to give them time to get in position. Then operator and finally scanner.

We play on Xbox and we did this challenge with a clan mate that this was his fourth clear of the raid. Our goal is to always try to find better ways to accomplish challenges in Destiny.

raidsecrets,"""Chain Strategy"" for ""Of All Trades"" Deep Stone Crypt Challenge","I've run this with several teams now, some successful and some not so successful.  I've seen multiple different strategies proposed, but this is the one that has consistently lead to success with a minimum number of wipes.  I searched the sub for this to have been posted but didn't see it - apologies if this is a dupe.

Start by opening the roster view and checking the order.  Tell everyone to remember the \*\*name\*\* of the next person in order, with the person at the end remembering the first person's name.

Assign first round roles to everyone.  First person gets Suppressor, third person gets Operator, and fifth person gets Scanner.  Second, fourth, and six are first round add clears/bomb runners.

Once both bombs have been deposited, anyone with a buff is going to go to the station and call out the name of their buff and the person whose name was next in the roster.  That person is going to take that buff.

For example, let's assume your fireteam consists of:

1. Alice
2. Bob
3. Charlie
4. Dani
5. Elsie
6. Frank

Then you'd start by saying: ""Alice, you're calling out Bob.  Bob you're calling out Charlie.  Charlie, you're calling out Dani.  Dani, you're calling out Elsie.  Elsie, you're calling out Frank.  Frank, you're calling out Alice.""   (Confirm that everyone remembers the name they're calling.)

""Alice, you're first Suppressor.  Charlie, you're first Operator.  Elsie, you're first Scanner.""  (Confirm that everyone knows what buff they're picking up)

Remind everyone that they should not put buffs into the station until after both bombs have been dunked.

With this strategy, every player only needs to remember two things - what they are doing the first round (if anything) and whose name they are calling out when they drop buffs (if they have a buff at the end of any given round).  No numbers, no geometry, no teams, no JPEGs, etc.",1609342895,2020-12-30 10:41:35

TLDR; After finishing a phase, the timer goes away as if the phase completes but the plates don't let you read making you stuck in the encounter causing a guaranteed wipe, aka soft locking the encounter. This happens randomly, but very commonly.

But why does this happen remains. In Beyond Light Last Wish has seen many changes. A lot of these aren't even bugs, but intentional changes. One of these occurs in Vault where when you complete a lock (phase) during the encounter the cube in the middle spins. This seems to be the only intentional change to Vault and may be why the soft lock happens. However, I am not sure about this and it is only a theory.

This happens very commonly and makes Petra's Run significantly harder.",1609315396,2020-12-30 03:03:16

raidsecrets,Atraks - 1 you can get rid of purple stuff without using the airlocks,"This may be known already, apologies, and better explained too. 

While doing the challenge for atraks, we managed to get some of the purple things to disappear (and never come back) rather consistently with the following method:

Once we had 3 people carrying the purple things (we tried with 2, but success rate was lower) , we would make sure operator would shoot them so they drop all in the a very small area (we shot them all standing against the wall of the big pillar, left of the lifts. I don't know if the location matters). 
Then the people supposed to grab them would rush all together over them aaaand... Only 2 would come out carrying it, while 1 would be free of it.

Is there any explanation for this based on the fight mechanics?

raidsecrets,Some More Info on the Confluence Wrong Warp (New Ascendant Challenge Routes),"Contrary to what I initially thought, you're not falling through the ground when you hit the confluence portals with someone in Chamber of Starlight. It's a straight up wrong warp. From the Confluence side, it drops you off rather close to the region's ascendant challenge. From the outside, it drops you off almost underneath the distant city, way out of the box. That's the side I used for [Queen's Court](https://youtu.be/FILbBr07oqw). Thanks to Steppe for testing and realizing that all those warps were to the same two locations.

Naturally, while it's only two locations, you can hit each in 3 different regions, making for 5 independent locations (6 if they ever fix Harbinger's Seclude's confluence portal). At least some of the ascendant challenges overlap partially, if not fully.

One of the wrong warp locations is suspiciously close to Chamber of Starlight, as well as three different Ascendant Challenges. The other is mysterious, but I wonder if it might be near the Morgeth portals. That requires more testing. It may hold clues into why these regions are chosen for the wrong warp, and if we're very lucky, clues into how to do this in other areas. I currently believe this sort of glitch was behind the [Corridors of Time teleport bugs](https://youtu.be/5sKOusBhH_s) where people fell out of the map.

&amp;#x200B;

In other news, if any of those portals had been inside of Confluence itself, we could be in Shattered Throne from patrol! Or if one of the load zones to Confluence miraculously extends outside of the box...

Anyone have any ideas how this bug could possibly work? Or how we might apply it elsewhere? If I'm right, it's existed in at least one other area with a completely different style of teleport.",1609245111,2020-12-29 07:31:51

raidsecrets,"""Of All Trades"" Challenge might require ""three-core rounds"" from the non-augmented players?","This is kind of a follow-on from the [current theory](https://redd.it/ka37nu) (i.e. each of the six players must complete one round with each of the augments over the course of the encounter).

Each round, three of the players will have an augment and three will not. 

**My thought was that, so that *all* players will have a role/""trade"" each round, the three players *without* the augment would *all* have to collect and deposit a core as part of the challenge.**

---

###The basis for this theory is:

- The Taniks (Phase 1) Encounter has **four** ""core dispensers"".
- The normal role of the operator is, at the start of each round, to shoot one of the glowing panels next to a dispenser.
 - If the operator does their role normally, then **two** bombs will be dispensed.
 - If the operator does **not** shoot a panel within ~15 seconds of the start of a round, then **three** bombs will be dispensed instead (and an extra core disposal box will become illuminated to the scanner).

It seems odd that:

1. This encounter can be completed entirely with the [operator not operating](https://i.imgur.com/jDAB3sp.png).
 - To be fair, this is also true of the scanner for the final boss fight if you are using the four core method, but that is heavily speculated to be the final DSC Challenge: ""The Core Four"".
2. Despite there being four dispensers, only three are active at any one time, and so a maximum of three cores can be obtained during any one round. 

They have also shown, both with the [wipe screen](https://i.imgur.com/H55fclY.png) and with the ""Short Circuit"" Triumph (*""Confront Taniks while allowing only one player from your fireteam to deposit nuclear cores.""*), that they have the ability to track who deposits the cores, so it could be possible that they are also tracking the augments of the depositors?

###**So what is the role of the operator during this run?**

My initial thought was that the operator would basically become a ""second scanner"": they can see which of the four dispensers will *not* dispense a core (the one with an inactive panel next to it), and so can direct players to the correct core dispensers before they are dispensed.

However, I think that everyone can see this anyway because the active dispensers glow yellow to everyone ([inactive](https://i.imgur.com/fRqVt3g.png), [active](https://i.imgur.com/3bVJcN7.png))? I can't confirm this because the yellow glow only becomes prominent after a few seconds and most operators (including myself) have normally shot a panel within a second of the round beginning. In this case, the role of the operator would just be to clear ads and *not* shoot a panel?

raidsecrets,Of all trades challenge possible solution.,"Next reset brings us to our 3rd challenge for DSC. Of All Trades is the triumph. The challenge is for the 3rd encounter. I believe the challenge is to have all 6 guardians use all 3 augments during the encounter. If that is the challenge i believe i have a possible solution. After each nuclear core deposit phase (6 total), all augments will swap with their sub partner.. 

Hopefully this break down makes sense.
   
The numbering is head count of each guardian

(1/2)Scanner
(3/4) Operator
(5/6) Suppressor

1st phase: deposit core.
--between phases 1/2 , 3/4 , and 5/6 will swap their augments deactivated or not with each other-

2nd phase: deposit core
--between phases 1/2 need 3/4 augument. 3/4 need 5/6 augment. 5/6 need 1/2 augment. Everyone swap with respective augment. 

This gives everyone a turn at 1 augment and then they're passing it over to another pair.

Repeat these two core runs and by the 6th core deposit everyone should have done all 3 augments. 

If you have an understanding of my explanation but can break it down simpler or have another solution I'm all ears!

Guess we won't really know until reset. See you out there guardian.",1609136886,2020-12-28 01:28:06

raidsecrets,Discussion on internal names and devstrings from the game files,"I preface this post saying that all the content here comes from the game files. It isn’t particularly easy to provide proof of this, but I hope the evidence I provide is enough (or my previous posts here).

I've come across a lot of interesting internal names for things in Destiny 2 over the past few months, such as 'Blacker Hammerer' for Whisper or the Last Wish raid being called 'Beanstalk' [1] [2]. Most of them don’t mean too much and are made up on the fly (see the names of the packages, especially for crucible) [3]. However, some are definitely more interesting. 

The first interesting name is ‘veil’, referencing the Darkness. There is extraordinarily little information available for this. [Here’s a post on DestinyLore](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k7j7xv/the_name_veil/) that I found about it, which poses the word ‘veil’ in current lore as difficult to link to the Darkness. In the game files, there are a few references to the world veil. As seen [in this reference image](https://i.imgur.com/GX7xzbB.png), it specifically describes a “veil pyramid ship” and “veil statue”. This shows Bungie internally use the name veil as a reference to the Darkness, even if it may not be used currently in lore. 
Some may also spot the 'S13 ...' line which is in standard English, a very rare occurrence for game files outside the text files. These are left-over devstrings that describe how an activity happens. [This is the description](https://i.imgur.com/NxQ543Y.png) for the Deep Stone Crypt raid. Bungie, please get rid of these as some of them are quite telling of future content :)

The second interesting term is the ‘Dark Vanguard’. From what I know this idea is just a running theory that the new trio of Eris, Drifter, and Elsie represent a new Vanguard to represent the Darkness. This is referenced a single time in the game files shown [in this image](https://i.imgur.com/C9D8slF.png).

My last interesting term is for the wish plates. I’m able to identify how many wishes are active on the wish wall (of which there are only 14…), and funnily enough the wish plate sequences are named [‘gameshark codes’](https://i.imgur.com/8dnS11G.png).

This isn't much, but I think it provides an insight as to what Bungie is internally calling some bits and pieces.
I personally don’t like making distinct statements or conclusions about the future of the game, but merely present the information. Please don’t take it out of context of this being internally-used naming, as much of the internally-used names never get used in the live game or in lore.

raidsecrets,Maximizing AFK Dawning Spirit Farm Efficiency: A Proposal,"I was doing the complete Shattered Throne the other day to try to help my friend get Wish Ender and we ended up finding a checkpoint right next to a staircase where the thrall would endlessly spawn, after Vorgeth and before Dul Incaru. Since there seemed to be about 8 spawn points throughout the entire staircase that didn't shut off when you got close, and that the area could sustain multiple Doom Fang Pauldrons Bottom Tree Sentinel Shields, I surmized it to be a better farming spot for Dawning Spirit. I did some testing and I got 122% Dawning Spirit gain in one hour, as indicated by the Triumph, Get In The Spirit.  


Is this faster than the thrall room with the slow effect?  


My load out for the test was ACD/0 Feedback Fence, Bottom Tree Sunbreaker, Charge Harvester, Stacks on Stacks, Reactive Pulse, Supercharged. I occasionally used grenades and fired my guns to prevent myself from being kicked for AFKing.",1609014705,2020-12-26 15:31:45
raidsecrets,Here's what the Dawning quest will end in,"Bungie clearly doesn't want us to fail this quest, as they tripled dawning spirit rewards recently which will allow us to complete the quest and eventually claim the overflowing dawning presents. But why?

Based on what Bungie has done in the past, I'd wager that it's a new exotic weapon, for four reasons.

\- Bungie doesn't like handing out cosmetics. That's putting it lightly. They used to have Dawning engrams as rewards where you could get the ornaments, but they removed that. The Prismatic Matrix? removed that. Individually, there are players who aren't really doing anything to generate Dawning Spirit but will most likely acquire the reward because the only other steps are to bake five cookies and deliver them to different vendors. Because cosmetics are Bungie's main source of monetization besides expansions and season passes, why give one out as the final reward of a quest involving MILLIONS of players when you can just sell it at Eververse? Bungie often also makes certain cosmetics more difficult to come by than certain exotics. Racking up 6,000 Bright dust playing on one character for a Dawning armor set is no easy feat, and look at how this stacks up against the exotic quests for Rat King, Traveler's Chosen, or MIDA.

\- On the other hand, we know that Bungie loves FOMO. Again, that's putting it lightly.  Heir Apparent exotic was one of the worst offenders, available for just three weeks during a seasonal event and it was tied to a super tedious quest, although this one was not a community event. Thunderlord, Arbalest, and Heir Apparent were all tied to Eva Levante's seasonal events in the past, so it's certainly possible it could happen again. At least Thunderlord and Arbalest were made into RNG drops after the event ended.

\- The other massive community event in Destiny's history rewarded an exotic quest (I understand the huge differences between this event and Corridors of Time, however the result is likely the same)

\- Finally, seasonal exotics (not counting Raid exotics) have come in threes ever since Joker's Wild. If this trend continues, we are still waiting on the third.",1609011135,2020-12-26 14:32:15

Went all the way through the reservoir in radio silence, killing taken with no feathers or birds that I could see, got to the end room, killed the boss (which actually spawned) and then decided to take a look around to see if there was anything weird.

Went up to door on the far top left (from where you come from in LoS) and had an interact box saying ""commune with the traveler"" (no traveler bird to signpost it).

Interacting with it spawned a traveler bird above the door and played me some dialogue where Crow wonders why that section of the reservoir is closed off, saying that there is only a broken ship in there. He then says that he had been sent on an errand to destroy it by Spider at some point, but had left it and claimed it as his own, trying but failing to fix it. The bird disappeared after, and the visual effect when a taken blight door is broken played (the door still remains sealed).

raidsecrets,Solo Skip ALL of Garden of Salvation in Beyond Light (USING BLINK ONLY),"#VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/6tP-hfdY-tI

I wanted to demonstrate a full Garden of Salvation Solo Skip and Out of Bounds by doing it in a unique and challenging way, so I decided that Blink would be the best option for this.


Salvation's Grip made some of the rock climb a lot easier as a Blink Warlock.

100 Mobility and Astrocyte Verse helps a lot for the ""Astrocyte Verse Wall Climb with Nova Warp + Blink"" segment where I use my Super to help aid me towards to end of the rock wall. 

I then switch over to 100 Intellect and Transversive Steps, as I needed to wait for my Super 2 more times to get across hard obstacles.  For example, without the use of Nova Warp it seemed very unlikely that you could get around the ""Turn Back Zone"" at the top of the rock wall while using Blink, so super seemed necessary.

I also failed the radiolaria fluid lake towards the end with the 3 sword ammo I had left.  My idea was that I would blink and then tesseract over with Worldline Zero... but it was not sufficient and I fell down the vines and died in the lake.  With no ammo left, I waited for my Super again and used Nova Warp to get across. 

Overall, this was pretty fun and something different.  Maybe even the first ever **full** skip showcasing as a Blink Warlock, but don't quote me on that!


I hope you enjoyed and Merry Christmas!",1608926683,2020-12-25 15:04:43

Sure, we could go once on week 3, but do we really want Bungie telling us where we can and can't go?

A few days back,  my buddy u/[Ironytheloreaxe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ironytheloreaxe) sent me a [curious video](https://youtu.be/n58BfUxA4T8) of falling through the ground while entering the confluence portal. With the help of u/stepmuffin, we eventually narrowed down the steps to reproduce to what is possibly the dumbest glitch I have ever seen. I was completely flabbergasted. It's hard to describe how ridiculous I found the whole thing. All you need to do to break the confluence portals is have a fireteam member go stand in the Chamber of Starlight lost sector in Rheasilvia.

With that mystery out of the way, it didn't take long to theory craft a route to Queen's Court. Utilizing the ironically simple teleport break, a bit of [infinite sparrow flying](https://youtu.be/mi4dT5WAnEI), and some good ol' [stasis climbing](https://youtu.be/yvyyeikvMcA), I was able to cross the vast expanse to reach Queen's Court once again.

&amp;#x200B;

Check out the results here: [https://youtu.be/FILbBr07oqw](https://youtu.be/FILbBr07oqw)

&amp;#x200B;

This was no simple task. It took [nearly an hour](https://youtu.be/6sGJN6SOuh4) to pull off, and most of that did not have room for breaks. However, it is theoretically doable on any character. I'd recommend a Titan though. You'll need Stasis unlocked, with Whisper of Shards, and high Discipline for fast recharge. I'd go for 100, but Khepri says 80 will cut it too. You'll want a sword to cross gaps if you're not cool enough to sparrow fly the full way, and a nice reliable gun for ice chipping.

I wonder if this is how the strange teleport in Corridors of Time worked. Might need to investigate other teleporters for similar bugs. I have no idea why being in one particular lost sector can break teleporters in 3 unrelated regions...",1608817406,2020-12-24 08:43:26

I feel like this is worth posting here as I think it'll be extremely helpful for new light players and almost everyone looking for high stat rolls. 

For some reason, Devrim Kay appears to be selling insanely good stat roll armor this season, with a power cap of 1360. 

Last week, Ekuegan shared a tweet of Devrim selling Titan Boots with 30 Resilience and 20 Intellect.  https://twitter.com/Ekuegan/status/1339450127077920768

This week I've now noticed that Devrim Kay is selling Warlock Gauntlets with 30 Recovery.

I think if this trend keeps up, it should be a reset ritual to go straight to Devrim to see what he's selling... He's basically the XUR of Legendary Armor right now and not many people are aware.  I'm actually excited to see what he sells for Hunters. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since then iv found you can replicated this by having 2 teammates run in a corner and shoot it off their heads at the same time and have BOTH of their character models touch 1 buff. It works better when you have multiple people since it despawns more however this was used for the copies on copies challenge yesterday and WILL NOT WIPE YOU.

raidsecrets,Efficient Route to get from Deep Stone Crypt's Entrance to 3rd Encounter (Skip 1st and 2nd) [1:56],"#VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/T8_AKpCzjig

A video of me utilizing my Sparrow to get up and Out of Bounds in the Entrance before the 1st Encounter and doing some Sparrow Launches along the way to essentially get outside Crypt Security's Out of Bounds. 

I proceed to jump down the pipe until I hit a load zone for the Atraks-1 area ""Clarity Control"" and then go back up.  Once I'm at the top I then hit the ""Morning Star"" load zone. I continue over to where a Checkpoint would initiate later on — once I've been in this spot this will auto-complete itself later on once the Atraks-1 encounter is completed. I then make my way back and load the ""Rapture"" load zone which loads up the area for 3rd encounter so I can then find an entry point to get inside which I show later on.  

You can use this routing for real in a speedrun or a general raid.  ***How?***   You will need to quickly make your way outside of the Atraks-1 door as the encounter is starting and the door is closing, then you can climb up and die, to which you will then respawn/death warp back to where this video actually starts.  

If done properly, you can execute what is shown and essentially pull your fireteam forward to the 3rd encounter once they've killed Atraks-1.  Quite technical, but pretty fun.  It's moreso used in Speedrunning, but thought I'd show the routing. Enjoy!

raidsecrets,Atraks-1 cheese still possible fully solo,"I don't think I've seen any content about the Atraks-1 cheese being possible fully solo since you need to use a super to get through the door. So here's how I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to do it fully solo using the following method:

I used Heritage with recombination, Seventh Seraph shotty with trench barrel and The Lament. I was on hunter with the stasis super and using Mask of Bakris for some extra damage. The charged with light mods were: Stacks on Stacks, High-energy fire, Charge Harvester and Lucent Blade. I used one grenade launcher reserves and one shotgun reserves mod and a shotgun loader.

What i did was kill the two shanks at the pods to get two stacks of recombination, go upstairs and try to kill all 4 wretches with the stasis shurikens to get 6x recombination.

I did the glitch and usual then switched Salvations Grip for The Lament.

When I got to the boss to damage, I used the doge for the bonus damage, shot the recombination shot, then fired all 6 Seventh Serpah trench barrel shots, then changed to Heritage and unloaded it into the boss. By then I had another dodge charge, used it to reload Heritage and then used The Lament with the bonus damage from Mask of Bakris. Once I only had 7 sword ammo left, I changed to the shottys to unload them. I threw grenades whenever I could. 

I only had about 5/10 seconds after getting her health down to the final stand part to reload my guns and charge the sword melee so it's a bit tight. 

I thought I'd post this since I've not seen anything else about if it can be solo'd without a super. I hope this helps some people get the challenge!",1608746869,2020-12-23 13:07:49
raidsecrets,My Take on the Atraks-1 Challenge,"Me and some other people were discussing last night about the nature of the challenge and came to the conclusion that the challenge has yet to be figured out.

Reasoning: Currently it is a DPS check, kill Atraks-1 before you eject any replication buffs. This isn’t really a challenge, so much as asking groups to kill the boss as fast as possible.

Every single challenge in the past has been able to be completed in multiple phases (sometimes forced) and flawlessly (more on this later)


Currently, there are 2 known methods of doing multiple phases for challenge.

Method 1: “Combine” buffs by shooting off multiple near each other, condensing and reducing the amount you have to carry. I disbelieve that this is the intended way because this appears to be a glitch, not an actual mechanic.

Method 2: Eject players holding the replication from the airlock and chain resurrection. Also believe this is unintended because this only allows 2 phases and removed the flawless stipulation.

These are my thoughts on the challenge and I encourage us secret hunters and raiders to figure out what the challenge actually is. I’m going to include a list of challenges below that show what I mean about flawless multi-phase to show that there is a pattern.

Baths: No inherent reason it cannot be multi-phased or done flawlessly (having one person in the middle pool permanently)

Dogs: Challenge requirements reset each phase (each person can only shoot one spore per phase)

Calus: Closest we have to a DPS check, but allows multiple phases, which Atraks-1 does not

Kalli: No inherent reason you cannot multi-phase (activate all 9 plates each phase)

Morgeth: No inherent reason you cannot multi-phase (keep small ogres alive entire fight)

Riven: To remind of the goal, no player can shoot the same eye twice. There are 10 eyes per phase in groups of 2, 2, and 6. Each person can shoot 10 eyes so on a lucky run you can up to 6 phases without failing challenge, while an unlucky run could go through a minimum of 2. This is the best example of why Atraks-1 still has not been solved, as Riven was and has been 1-phased since early forsaken as the “usual” strategy.

IP Phase 1: Forced 3 Phase (Each person must pick up exactly 1 of each buff from underground)

IP Phase 2: no reason it cannot be multi-phased (each player shoots out exactly 1 shield generator on IP)

Deception: No inherent reason it cannot be multi-phased (each phase must have 5 shield breaks exactly)

Gal’ran: No inherent reason it cannot be multi-phased (each person shoots out one hand per damage phase, though it’s buggy and controversial, may be a max of 2 phases depending on interpretation)

Both Consecrated and Sanctified have mechanics based on the mechanics leading up to damage phase. No reason they cannot be multi-phased


Sorry for the long post, and I wish the true secret hunters good luck with this endeavor",1608746648,2020-12-23 13:04:08

Considering we still need to get the 15th wish, I think we could get another thing we wanted, the 6th chest.

It is a 99% that we won't get a 6th chest but we will either get the wish during VoG or Witch queen because they have some connection to LW.

VoG with the oracle sounds and Witch queen because of Savathün and that whole thing.

raidsecrets,Cookie Cutter Sword Meta.,"So originally I wasn’t going to post this but with new light players and heavy sword meta sticking around for a bit I decided to make my first post.

This is my generalised build across all three characters. The cookie cutter build do everything bar raids. So for the new players that are getting slapped around, this may be for you.

What you’ll need.

1 - neutral energy item (ie any element)

You’ll put charged up for gaining charged stacks from orbs. (Of course this is best used with masterworked weapons)

2 - 2x void energy armour for stacks on stacks and protective light.

3 - 1x solar energy armour for super charged.

4 - 1x personal preference for other mods.

How it works.

So essentially you are forgoing damage mods in preference of damage reduction which can be more helpful to newer players.

With stacks on stacks you’ll pick up 2 charges for every orb you pick up.

With supercharged you’ll be able to stack 4 charges.

With protective light and a 4 stack of charged with light, when your shields break you’ll receive a hefty damage reduction. This reduction lasts longer the more charges you have. When your shields regenerate you’ll still have the damage reduction (to my knowledge, I’m open to new info) which makes a character like devour lock or top tree sentinel ideal for this build but ultimately it’ll work with anything as it’s not weapon specific.

This build is focused around sword heavy. The reason being is the damage is so good for swords right now that for me, there’s no other alternative without owning anarchy. Your other 2 weapon slots are preference. The damage reduction from the mod build will help keep you on the field longer. 

Ideal build for 1250 lost sectors etc.

The 5th piece of armour you can slot whatever you want. Raise the charge stack to 5 or take powerful friends for mobility etc etc. There’s a few choices depending on what you want from it.

Fairly simple cookie cutter do everything sub raid. It’ll stand up to 1250 nightfalls and lost sectors and pretty much anything else sub raid.

Hope this helps a few folk. My first post don’t on my break at work. Don’t be to harsh.",1608729733,2020-12-23 08:22:13

raidsecrets,Atraks-1 Challenge Cheese,"**The Challenge is you cannot cleanse or drop the debuffs inside of the cleansing rooms. If a room is opened and used to cleans the challenge will be failed. Therefore you must hold all 4 debuffs until the first phase of the encounter finishes. This will repeat after each phase.**  

The cheese for this encounter will allow you to have 1 or even 0 debuffs, once you concluded the first damage phase. This cheese is pretty simple, all you have to do is have 2 or more players with debuffs stand next to each other. This can be done easily right next the drop pods when entering the space platform, there is a small area on either side that will confine the balls. This will be a very crucial part of this cheese, you wanted the operator to knock the debuff off when all players with the buff are in close proximity, when the balls are knock off and close to each other one player will try and pick them up. This will cause one or even a few balls to despawn.",1608707938,2020-12-23 02:18:58

raidsecrets,Here's an original (to my knowledge) theory about Wish 15,"In season 15 (number coincidence, or not?) I believe Mara Sov will come back to the Dreaming City to end the curse.

In order to do this, though, she will need to bring back Sjur Eido, the first champion of the Awoken who promised before she died that she would rise again someday (Wish-Ender lore). I think that she knows something special about the darkness, and this is why she is required to break the curse. This is for two reasons:

\- She was assassinated and the Nine are heavily implied to be the perpetrators. The Nine must have had a reason, and they are all about balance. A strange coin, like Xur's from D1, was on her body.

\- She was the only documented person ever to survive an Aphelion attack, an entity of darkness known only to the Awoken and Calus.

I believe that with this season, once Sjur Eido is saved, Wish 15 will be introduced through a community puzzle like the Corridors of Time, and when it is entered on the wall Wish 15 will transport you to to the Distributary to fight an Aphelion. 

The Aphelion and Dreaming are two Awoken-known entities of the Darkness and Light respectively, and destroying a being of pure darkness in the Distributary will, through some primordial space magic, restore the balance of the Awoken realm in favor of the light and counteract Riven's curse, making the Dreaming City pure again.

Because of Sjur Eido's connection to the Nine, and the entities of pure light and dark, and the Nine's underlying connection to the Awoken (such as the Ahamkara, the Emissary, and Xur playing a part in the reef wars) I believe this plot of Season 15 would be the perfect opportunity to further the plot line of the Nine as well, first expanded on in Season 6. The Nine are going to have a large presence in Lightfall, if not the Witch Queen.",1608691779,2020-12-22 21:49:39

raidsecrets,Riven dawning spirit cheese,"I was doing a last wish with my friends and went to give riven a cookie, and when i did so, my whole team got the loot and dawning spirit. This happened every time thereafter for every person that gave her cookies. With this knowledge, we could go into the riven fight with a team of 6. i found that you can give her around 8-10 cookies per run before it kills you. This means that you get about 180 dawning spirit max per person per 10 cookies. 1 run of your entire team giving riven 10 cookies each equates to 1080 dawning spirit generated and a crap ton of loot. If you have 100 cookies each, that's 10800 dawning spirit. If we got enough people doing this method, we would reach the 1 billion goal in a matter of days. Getting 2 teams of 3 to grind lost sectors at the same time for a few hours and then getting together with around 1000 cookies total would equal roughly 108000 dawning spirit just from 1 group of people. imagine if there was 10's of 100's of these groups doing this, we could get this done in days.",1608676221,2020-12-22 17:30:21

2. Second Oracle will be to the right of the room. Once you drop down on to the Vex platform (where the Wyvern spawns in the Warrior Empire Hunt that you have to kill to open the gate), stop and look down behind you, the oracle should be below in the kill area.
3. Third Oracle is located above the Vex structure/platform you are standing on. It is a bit to the right, and might be a little hidden behind the giant vex strut, so you may need to backup back to the area where the room splits to see it and shoot it. 
4. Fourth and final Oracle is located to the left side of the giant vex structure on the right side of the Nexus.

raidsecrets,Taniks and his last ressurection.,"So I was playing the raid, and I noticed something. Taniks was mad about Atraks bringing him back. If you notice the first thing he does is yells at Atraks, then Atraks points to us and less aggressively says something. 

So My small theory is that Atraks didn't want to be resurrected again. 
I imagine that short conversation went something similar to:
Taniks, ""WWHHHHHYYYYYY""
atraks, ""The Guardians are back""

Then when he sees us he just wants revenge. 
But what It seemed like was, Taniks just didn't want to be brought back that last time.",1608641627,2020-12-22 07:53:47

raidsecrets,Potential Darkness Enemy,"No clue if somebody already posted this, but in the Dreaming City, out of bounds, in the unreachable ascendant realm that is identical to the rock island that Petra stands on, there is a a sort of [miasma](https://imgur.com/a/er4DYue) on it, which, my friend group believes is the first look at a darkness enemy, here's why:  


Our theory of why this Miasma could be Darkness is mostly somewhat plausible because of [this concept art](https://imgur.com/a/7m99C7m)  


The concept art is clearly showing the Darkness, as there are black triangles (The Pyramids), a ghostly humanoid shape (The Nightmares or the mirror of your guardian, as seen at the end of the Shadowkeep campaign), and a mist/miasma.  


I also have a reason why I believe that this is not just some taken effect/aura, this particular ascendant realm has a much lighter background than any others, not only this, but there is many more particle effects that can be seen all around that aren't any other realms  


In a Drifter lore book (I do not know which one), The Drifter mentions creatures that emanate an aura that suppresses Light, similar to a Darkness zone, and he describes the creature as being ""a gooey, vacuous form with no head."" I feel that this description fits the bill pretty well, however, there is also a piece in Cayde's Journal which describes what is widely believed to be some sort of Darkness entity:

 ""Sky is torn open and there's nothing and nobody left in this ruined world but me and the **boiling shadow** all around. Whatever it is hits me before I can level my gun. Doesn't matter. Tendrils of pain crawl over my splayed fingers, my outstretched arms, my shoulders, my neck, my screaming mouth as it consumes. I'm being enveloped. Everything is wrong. Primordial. My systems go sideways. All but my sensors. It wants me to witness this, the world."" 

Here is the [image](https://imgur.com/a/J8IAjUk) that goes along with this part of the Journal  


Both of these lore pieces have some clues in them about the creature's shape ""Gooey, vacuous form with no head"" is a good description of the miasma found in the ascendant realm, and in Cayde's Journal, he describes it as a ""boiling shadow"", not only this, but I find that the word choice is quite interesting, ""**Tendrils** of pain"" I feel as though that may be somewhat describing the tendrils that come off of the miasma (however, I also acknowledge this being a stretch).

That's basically all of what I've gathered, please give feedback, as I would like to know as much as possible on this.",1608601035,2020-12-21 20:37:15

I've explored the Prodromus Down area (beginning area of Exodus Crash) from Nessus Patrol dozens of times before, helping clanmates get the two lore items by squeezing through Failsafe's backend and continuing into that area.

Prior to Beyond Light / S12, going through that gap let you fly over some debris and able to explore that area, just showing a patrol area change on your screen (like when normally traversing around patrol - see [(462) Destiny 2 - Breaking into Prodromus Down - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh-yyMnZQbw)). Now, when jumping over the debris you hit an instanced loading (the sound and black screen we all know).

No timer. No listed mission/objective. No way to get back to patrol. I've explored the area, scannables, cave system but can't find anything yet. But I have **no idea** why Bungie would change an area you could previously walk into without a load zone into an instanced zone.

raidsecrets,Skip Vorgeth but Still Access Statue for Wish-ender?,"My son and I spent the afternoon Thunder Crashing our way past Vorgeth. We got out of the map and around Vorgeth no problem. 

But, we were unable to find a way to reach the statue, so I could interact with the statue for the first time in the Wish-ender quest.

After getting past Vorgeth, we tried a number of things to get a checkpoint/spawn at the statue.

We approached the statue, and were teleported back to the Vorgeth fight. We then: 
- Died in the fight, exited to orbit, and then spawned back in to see if we got a statue checkpoint. Nope. Back at the start of the Vorgeth fight.
- accessed the map, selected the Shattered Throne, and spawned in at the start of the Vorgeth fight. Darn.
- returned to orbit, travelled back to the Shattered Throne, and spawned in at the start of the Vorgeth Fight. Dammit.

We figured winding up back in the fight we were trying to avoid was a bad idea.

For our next attempts, we didn’t go towards statue.
- We walked in the opposite direction of the statue, and died as we plummeted to our deaths. We then revived: at the start of the Vorgeth fight. Grrrrr.
- We just returned to orbit after going around Vorgeth. We re-entered the dungeon, and we wound up at the start of the Vorgeth fight. We ran out of ideas.

In December 2020, is there any way to interact with the statue after bypassing Vorgeth? While we’ve put a lot of time and effort into going around him, we’ve spent a lot more than that trying to kill him.

We were doing this on Xbox, but we can also attempt it on PlayStation or PC if one of those would work better/offer a solution.

We did it together, but we could try it solo. He was carried through the dungeon previously, so he has his first interaction with the statue. I don’t have mine yet.",1608423152,2020-12-19 19:12:32

raidsecrets,Shattered Throne Dungeon Skips and Out of Bounds (Salvation's Grip),"#VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/8sKsKpReiBM

&amp;nbsp;

While I was farming Dawning stuff in here, I decided to think outside of the box and do something different utilizing Salvation's Grip.  

The first skip displayed in Thrallway is a lot easier to hit for any player, and the second skip is pretty cool as I've not seen Salvation's Grip utilized here to skip over to the Vorgeth entrance.  The 3rd skip (out of bounds only now) is the old Vorgeth Skip strategy that got patched and no longer works (does not yield the next checkpoint).  But this is a VERY consistent way of getting out of bounds and you don't even have to use blink anymore.  Not really sure if the first two strategies are useful at all to some in a speedrun scenario, so I just listed this as being situational at best, and for fun. Enjoy.

Patch [3.0.1.3](https://3.0.1.3) made it impossible to crouch while trapped in ice walls.

Supers like Code of the Missile (Arc Middle Tree) super on Titan forces the character to crouch, and Silence &amp; Squall (Stasis) super for Hunter moves the character back as well. This strategy is even more consistent than the old breach. The video I did only took one try to make it work.

Also note that you don't need much ice walls placed like what I did in the video. I just wanted more for fun, otherwise just place two walls on your feet (just like the breach 1.0).

Credit goes to Squirelockholms for doing the same strategy for Titan.

raidsecrets,"Corruption, Dredgen Yor, and a fistful of crayons.","Bear with me fellas, this is a long one.

So I heard conjecture recently on the subject of other darkness subclasses, on being discussed was that of corruption, more commonly known as soulfire. Guardians already wield Corruption in limited amounts, be it hive weapons or the effects of the original Thorn. No documented accounts exist of Corruption being utilized without slowly turning the wielder towards Sword Logic. 

I have noticed a pattern with releases in Destiny 2 as of Late. Both of the major expansions centered upon one Guardian race, With Forsaken being the Awoken, And Beyond Light being Exos. We're due for one focusing on standard Humans. Each expansion featured major players we hadn't seen since Destiny 1. With the return of Prince Uldren and Petra, as well as The Stranger, we can only assume that  this return is of some significance in the long run.

Here's where I go from vague Conjecture to pure guesswork. We have never directly met either Shin Malphur or Dredgen Yor. Yor is dead, killed by Malphur, but his ghost never died. The two parted ways before his final Confrontation with Shin Malphur. So I believe Dredgen Yor can be resurrected. He never genuinely lost his connection to the light, simply forgoing it in pursuit of his own madness. If he was to be brought back, it is almost certain he would have access to a throne world, due to his slaughter of countless lightbearers. The only other known throne world not belonging to the Hive is that of Mara Sov, to whom our resident Hive Expert Eris Morn is a close ally of.  Mara Sov's throne world is large enough to be a sizeable threat to our good friend Savathun the Witch Queen, who is most likely the focus of next year's expansion.

We have met friendly members of every enemy race except for the Hive. Calus, Mithrax, and the harpy on Nessus being our primary examples. While Eris Morn is an expert on the Hive, we have never been allied or even on steady ground with any ascendant hive members. leading me to believe that we will at some point meet one who sides with the Traveler or at the very least sympathizes with the ideology of Guardians.

Now how does this all tie together? I believe that in the next expansion, we will gain access to a new subclass under the darkness, most likely corruption (soulfire), and who is more likely to teach guardians how to wield it other than either Savathun herself or Dredgen Yor? The Original Hive or the Original Dark Guardian?

Alright, thanks for sticking with me as I rambled, this has been on my mind for ages now and I finally managed to stick it into something vaguely resembling Cohesion. Apologies for the disconnected thoughts and loose ends.",1608251534,2020-12-17 19:32:14
raidsecrets,Possibly new aspect/fragment/exotic that can change titan super coming soon?,"I was re-watching the trailers bungie has made for Beyond Light and came across a very interesting scene showing a titan wielding not one but two stasis gauntlets when he activates his stasis super. The super/ability the titan casted was different because instead of sending 3 lines of stasis in multiple directions, it sends out one huge line of stasis rising up from the ground that has a different pattern than the stasis behemoth slam we know. I noticed that the icicles created by the super are also different as it's not pointy like the behemoth slam but more squared off like teeth. It looks like this ability is a one time thing as the titan stopped glowing with stasis after it so it probably won't be a roaming super if it actually is implemented into the game. The recent polygon interview with Luke Smith stated that the destiny team will ""sunset"" supers essentially condensing everything down into one super and not three. If we get aspects/fragments/exotics that can change our super to 1 of the 3 in the subclass then it might actually save destiny from sunsetting supers. An example of this would be inserting an aspect or fragment into the solar warlock that changes the dawnblade into a well of radiance.

P.S: This could all be a hoax and maybe this wasn't intended to be in the final cut but it's interesting that bungie showed us this during a trailer for the game. Don't take it too seriously it probably wasn't meant to be in the game.",1608251130,2020-12-17 19:25:30

raidsecrets,Titan Sword+Stasis Melee patched?(And a discussion on skating strategies),"At the start of this season a new type of titan skating was discovered, with lion rampants, a sword, and the titan stasis melee. It revolved around jumping, swiping with the sword, swapping off the sword and using the stasis melee, swapping back to the sword and jumping again, swapping off the sword and using the normal melee twice, which for some reason gave you back melee energy. It sounds complex, but it is easily the easiest type of new skating as you have a lot of time to do the inputs. I was able to do this pretty easily but since last tuesday it seems like the swap back to the sword and off the sword is delayed, and it breaks up the skate. Am I now doing it wrong, or have you guys seen this.

I also made this post because I was trying to find the newest ways of skating/compile finds on it. There is this titan melee skate(which seems to be patched). On hunter there is a shatterdive worldline skate(which I cannot seem to get consistent with), a lament heavy attack skate(use lament, jumping while blocking, heavy attack and swap weapons and jump) which may or may not increase speed, and a block in air with lament into light attack into heavy attack while falling kindof skate really just way to sword skate in air on hunter. On warlock there are a bunch, first there is the well worldline skate(hunter shatterdive skate but with well instead of shatterdive). There is the top dawn normal burst+icarus skate. There is the top dawn sword swipe, swap weapons, skate. There are the lament skates: you can block, jump, swipe, swap weapons and icarus dash to go fast but I don't know how to do it consistently. You can block, jump, swipe, jump right before hitting the ground and then jump right after before doing the normal icarus which seems to be the fastest method(if you can get it down), faster than the normal swap skate bar well skating. Any other finds on these, and any new skates you guys have tried out?",1608236592,2020-12-17 15:23:12

raidsecrets,Another version of farming ingredients for dawning in Shattered Throne.,"So I'm guessing all of you know the previous way known to farm the ingredients with the solar titan. 

I'm here to just share this setting so you could farm some other ingredients than the solar titan setting.

The whole point of this setting is three mods :

Light from darkness (void warmind mod)

Grasp of the warmind (void warmind mod)

Reactive pulse (arc charge of light mod)

How the build work goes like this :

1. Light from darkness gives you a stack of charge of light when you defeat opponents nearby a warmind cell.

2. Grasp of the warmind will make the warmind cell you're holding permantly exist, thus all enemies coming close to you would be affected by light from darkness forever.

3. Reactive pulse will kill the thralls that comes close and will also give a stack of charge of light back dying to the pulse.

This works best with warlock void bottom tree, or with any other class with 100 recovery for the best. This build can work crazily well at the thrall section on 2nd/3rd encounter. 

Thank you for reading the long post, and have a happy dawning guardians!

Then have the person who launched the Hunt leave the fireteam and switch characters and join back, complete it then have the person who launched the activity originally go back to that character and re-luanch the hunt.

This doesn't take your lure charge and gives 15 essence per run easily.

raidsecrets,In depth DSC third encounter questions,"These questions are almost only applicable to speedruns (and even then they are VERY specific), so I'm sorry if this isn't the place, or if most people will find this useless. But any help or theories would certainly help.

1: Is there a bias as to what augment gets deactivated? It would appear, to us, that operator and suppressor at far more likely to get deactivated than scanner. You'd assume to see a 1/3 chance over a large amount of runs, but that's not the case. The further question is then, are there set strings for which augments that get deactivated? Sort of like calus. Or is the order based on some unknown trigger, like ad clear etc.

2: When spawning the first nukes it is possible to spawn them by killing 50, 60 or 70 ads. Why is there a difference? Shouldn't it always be the same? Is there a certain order of killing ads that dictates the amount of spawns or is it simply random?

3: Do you have to kill captains to progress the encounter at max speed? Or is there a certain amount of ads you have to kill for each wave, because then it's be quicker to leave all captains alive.

Here are some videos that I have put together that aggregate multiple methods to get both ""hidden"" Last Wish chests for each subclass solo using only 1 wish per character. 

The key to getting the Shuro Chi chest is to use a pretty easy OOB. The only catch is you might need to set your Resolution to 1080p and cap your Frame Rate to 30 prior to getting into the loading zone. This is because the loading zone may kill you if your frames are too high.

raidsecrets,Six Man Patrol (Europa and Dreaming City),"I've been doing some messing around from Deep Stone Crypt and Last Wish, and it turns out you can break out into patrol zones in both.

For Deep Stone Crypt, this gives you basically the full patrol experience, minus, like, patrols, since you're already in an activity and can't start a new one. Can't launch flags either for the same reason, and because of player limits. You can, however, do public events and normal lost sectors.

Dreaming City puts you in a pseudo patrol. Only Blind Well is public. Everything else is private, leading to the three normal public areas being completely devoid of life. No ads, no random guardians, no corsairs, and no Petra. The privately instanced offshoots are all normal. And the Strand Diving Board is disabled, so you can freely explore [the Ascendant Realm](https://youtu.be/zJgL4kKf2UM) down there. 

I'm issuing two challenges to you fine folks:

1. Get a 6 man fireteam on Europa where everyone has their own tank.
2. Get into Spine of Keres after completing the Last Wish Queenswalk instant clear cheese.

Both should be possible, but the second seems pretty difficult.

raidsecrets,"[Bug] Debuffs do not work on Atraks-1, only the captain outside of the map.","TLDR; Despite showing more damage in the wipe screen, applying a debuff to Atraks-1 does the same amount of damage as applying no debuff to Atraks-1. However, you can apply a debuff that works for everyone damaging by applying a debuff to the captain outside the map that hold's Atraks' health bar.

Video showing/explaining this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYFWimMqno&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYFWimMqno&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

To start this, damage numbers do not work properly on Atraks-1. They do not translate to actual damage during the encounter. In the video provided, it is seen that although applying a debuff shows more damage in a wipe screen, they do the same as not using a debuff. My clanmate Scrub and I tested this by having me go out of the map and apply a debuff to see if it made us actually do more damage.

With Lament, the lunge on it is noticeably buggy, as you can tell from gameplay.

After testing it, I consistently got sent flying when doing an air combo and heavy attacking when Shuro flinched.

raidsecrets,Secret message hidden in Legacy Pt 2 lore tab?,"So call me crazy but I think there might be a secret hidden in the [Legacy Pt 2](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48825) lore tab.

Not sure if anyone's picked up on it. I did a few searches but saw no one mention it. But basically half way down you see this text:

&amp;#x200B;

 *ECHO- 2̷͉͙̜̗͍̙̭̤̘̪͖͈͛̅͑̈̀̾6̸̡͇̼̦̲̩͎̟̠̬̳̲̂̀̉͐̃̈́ͅ2̵̡͎͚̳̠̫̮͉̍̉̌̒͑̓͗͛̉̈́̕̚͝5̸̨̭͚͔̥̲̫̈́̂̈́̊̋͗͑͛͑͝͝* 

&amp;#x200B;

And then it's repeated further down

&amp;#x200B;

 *ECHO- 2̷͉͙̜̗͍̙̭̤̘̪͖͈͛̅͑̈̀̾6̸̡͇̼̦̲̩͎̟̠̬̳̲̂̀̉͐̃̈́ͅ2̵̡͎͚̳̠̫̮͉̍̉̌̒͑̓͗͛̉̈́̕̚͝5̸̭͚̈́̂̈́̊̋͗͑͛͑͝͝- Present Day* 

&amp;#x200B;

So there are what appears to be 4 bands of ASCII glyphs. But what's interesting is that if you convert the glyphs of the two ""2625"" sections and compare them they are almost identical except for the last spinner on the second iteration.

I actually converted it to ASCII decimal codes and [plotted it on a graph](https://imgur.com/a/oN0p1rm).

So it's basically just the section after ECHO-  and before - Present Day. The dips are the low ASCII characters ""2"" ""6"" ""2"" ""5"" and the peaks are the garbled glyphs. There also seems to be repeating 204 and 205 characters which are ""box drawing characters"", presumably to orient it acrostically. 

But what's interesting is that the second iteration has about 10 characters of extra data.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What's also interesting is some of the surrounding lore, including in the first part of: [Legacy](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48812)

So basically Ana finds a Bray Facility on Mars called Clovis 9 and within she finds two dead Exo's. She then finds:

&gt;Between the bodies lay a sleek instrument, sized for crew deployment and **dressed in precious filigree tendrils rimmed in calligraphic etching**. The instrument’s core **links to multiple platinum discus drums implanted into its frame**, resembling the smaller resonators on Ana’s helmet, and ends with a hopper-crown of artificial diamond bearings.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Here's what they used to crack the entrance door."" 

It also seems to interact with her helmet and we get some weird alliteration throughout referring to the resonance of her SN0MASK helmet.

Later after a weird detour from what's presumably the Darkness she ends up at Caelus Station orbiting Uranus. On board they find and converse with a frame and the frame says: 

&gt;“ECHO project requires a station link with &lt;**VERBAL CIPHER ENGAGED&gt; DEAD-ROCK &lt;VERBAL  CIPHER DISENGAGED&gt;** resources.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ana eyes go wide. “Jinju disengage that cipher thing.”

Before she Jinju can do anything she gets shot through the chest by a rogue Exo on board the station. Before she blacks out we read:

&gt; Howling storms slam **salt-coarse keys** in Ana’s helmet. 

We then get what seems to be the memories of each echo/reset of the Exo who shot her. They go as follows  ECHO-1, 0, 7, 22, 41, 89, 173, 390, 877 and then we finally get to 2625 with the weird glyphs.

She then comes back to life, has a fight with the Exo, wins and then she goes over to the console at Clovis Bray's desk  

&gt;Jinju nudges her shoulder. “I've got the mainframe data.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ana is devoid of thought at the mainframe access console. She watches as Uranus comes back into view over and over again. It dominates the station’s viewing port. **She maps the movement of the clouds along the surface, but only ever on the surface, and sees how they differ from the previous iteration on their last spin.** She wonders if they are different underneath.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stable major chords strum in Ana’s helmet, getting caught in the cracked visor glass.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So after reading all that a couple of things stuck out at me. 

* Firstly, she has some kinds of device with rotating metal drums with calligraphic etchings that the previous Exo's used to open the door. The device seems to interact with her SN0MASK.
* We have what seems to be a public key of sorts - DEAD-ROCK - which has a verbal cipher attached. And then her helmet lights up with ""salt-course keys"" which [salted keys in cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))
* We have the 4 ring glyphs surrounding the number 2625 that is repeated twice, slightly different on the second iteration.
* When she's looking at the mainframe access console, she seems to be mapping the clouds on Uranus - but its sounds exactly like the glyphs - **they differ from the previous iteration on their last spin.**

Keys, Iterations and Salts are common words used in Cryptography

[**https://www.adamberent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KeyIterationsCryptoSalts.pdf**](https://www.adamberent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KeyIterationsCryptoSalts.pdf)

So it really kinds feels like there's a secret buried in here that will unlock exactly what the ECHO-LINK points to and what DEAD-ROCK is a cover for.

Now I'm not an expert at cryptography but I did try a few things, including removing the repeating characters, performing a XOR between the two and seeing if it matched any known cryptographic algorithms like MD5 and SHA-256. I've also tried using different alphabets and unicode.

But being the layperson I am when it comes to this I really feel like I'm stabbing in the dark. So if there's something in here please let me know.

raidsecrets,Veil statues : The Lightfall Race or the Jebait by Bungie?,"Recently my fireteam and I were exploring the out of bounds route in the Deep Stone Crypt when I saw something very weird. 
I had heard about the Veil statues mid air on the Cosmodrome. And when I saw this I immediately assumed that there could be more. Here is a link to the picture of the statues that I assume are Veil statues. 

https://photos.app.goo.gl/4iK27LJMqFAhQZLw5

Does this probably mean that there could be statues like this around the system?
Is Bungie trying to indicate that the Veil are the end race we might face in Lightfall if it is the end the franchise? Or could it be the classic Bungie jebait we all dread. 

Let's hope the Veil are an actual thing and inclined to the darkness. 

If anyone wants to try to find these statues you have to make a out of bounds skip in the jumping puzzle of the Deep Stone Crypt where you  cannot let the inside appear. Angle yourself in a way to avoid the appearance of the insides of the ship and you should be able to see it.

raidsecrets,Clovis Bray Dot Language Puzzles/Secrets,"I've been watching this sub for a while now, and I decided to go out and find the main components to this sort of Dot Language Puzzle. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/AJnlaSn), I've collected all the images I mention.

It all starts with [the keyboard](https://imgur.com/RKyafbE), which specifies a dot pattern for a handful of keys on a keyboard. The language itself is pretty simple: each character is represented with either 3 or 4 dots, arranged in a 2x2 box grid (either all 4 boxes on the grid are filled, or one box is left empty). There are a few different types of dots as well, such as a filled dot and an empty dot. I once suspected there to be a dot that was partially filled, but upon further inspection, I concluded that there are only 2 different dot types. **If anyone has a high resolution of these puzzles or keyboard, without the screen's motion lines, it would be very much appreciated.**

Now for the puzzles. I'm sure you've seen these scattered about Europa and the DSC. What I've found is that there are many different orientations for this puzzles, with some being mirror images of others, and some being spun around. I don't know if the orientation means anything, however, I'm just going to mention the 2 puzzles I found in their, so to speak, ""correct"" orientation.

[Puzzle 1](https://imgur.com/HJX53uU) seems to be a more simple version of [puzzle 2,](https://imgur.com/EQemk17) with their only being 1 red variable (referring to the flashing oval in red). What these puzzles represent is unclear, however, I do hope to understand them in the near future, with (what I'm hoping will be) the challenges coming to the raid bring with them the secrets of the DSC.

The last thing I would like to mention is the [class items](https://imgur.com/LgQvKo5) received from the DSC. The line of text ""\^\*##()\_+\^/"" is seen on each class item, and for the warlocks, on their chest armor. When I converted what I could into Dot Language, nothing of notice seemed to appear, as it didn't match the puzzles or any other screens around Bray Tech or the DSC. 

I hope this language is brought to use soon, and I wish you all the best of luck deciphering the Crypt's secrets.",1607738702,2020-12-11 21:05:02

How to do it:

*  Get out of the map in The Reservoir area.

There are plenty of holes to choose from.  Pick your favorite.

*  Go around to the boss area.
*  Follow it around until you get to a room that looks like a box.
*  Crouch underneath the box-room.
*  Kill yourself while crouched under the box-room.

This will make your Ghost appear half in/half out of the room.

*  Have a team-mate revive you.
*  Wiggle around until you fall through the floor, and into the Turbine area.

* Explore.

I tested this mainly with warlock subclasses, so I'm not sure what other supers this works with, but it seems to work with any non-roaming/shutdown supers with a cast animation - Well of Radiance is the most likely candidate, but I got it to work a few times with Nova Bomb. [Here's a clip of it working with Well.](https://imgur.com/eRMFIdv)

I'm not sure exactly what this could be used for, and it seems pretty niche, just thought I'd share. I haven't tested this yet, so I'll update this post when I get around to it, but I suspect you could do something similar with certain finishers that allow weapon switching during, which would be a much more consistent and usable functionality than burning a super just to store an extra charge.",1607721335,2020-12-11 16:15:35

raidsecrets,"Possible Connection between Black Armory and Clovis Bray, Also a bit of lore on Cayde's first life as an exo","**HELGA RASMUSSEN**

In the Bray Lab Records- Confidential lore book in The Darkness lore tab, entry 4- Test No:312- Exo Arm Attachment- listed under identities is the name H. Rasmussen, one of the 3 founding members of the black armory is Helga Rasmussen, now possible theories is that before the collapse and before the darkness, Helga Rasmussen worked on the exo program with Clovis Bray, now if it is the same person from Black Armory, there is a possibility that Rasmussen might have essentially brought this research from Clovis Bray to BA, and this tech was used to create Ada-1, I have only unlocked 2 of this lore book and it is time gated.

[https://gyazo.com/380ffa73869f68a2c75a4948d20baf3c](https://gyazo.com/380ffa73869f68a2c75a4948d20baf3c) also in this entry Clovis Bray directly calls Rasmussen by first name- Helga, so this confirms that this is Helga or Bungie would've probably chosen a different name, also during the golden age, human life doubled or tripled or extended longer than 100 years, so it is possible this is a younger Helga.

This lore book is obtainable through the augmented triumphs to shoot the drones.

&amp;#x200B;

**CAYDE-01**

In the lore of the new raid helmet for deep stone crypt, cayde-1 is chatting with one of his exo friends- Knox-4, and after a brief conversation, they hear a sound from an evesdropper on their conversation and pursue. Now in the lore entry in Dusk and Dawn called Your friend, Micah Abrams there is more information. In this lore book, a child named Micah Abrams came to europa with his father, a shrink who is helping with the exo project, in entry 5, the latest entry- he is actually the one thats evesdropping on cayde's conversation, and the entry ends with him being caught by cayde and knox but we don't know what happens next so there is quite alot of speculation for what may happen next to the child.

the lore can be found in collections for the helmet

and this is what matched with the ending of both of the entries

raidsecrets,Taken captain boss in the reservoir (EDZ) mystery,"Taken captain in the reservoir(EDZ) mystery

The pathway to the dam or reservoir from one of the hawkmoon missions is open in patrol. It has the same adds and bosses. This could be a bug or something but I doubt it. Once you reach the boss room there is a taken captain similar to the one you fight in the hawkmoon quest. This taken captain seems like it can only be killed by using hawkmoon. I tried using fallen guillotine and almost right away it teleported away. ( I don’t recall if this happens in the mission.) 

To be clear you can damage it with other weapons and your super but it just seemed to run away almost immediately. When I used hawkmoon I got it down to about 1/4 of its health then it ran away. 

What I think could happen when you kill it is that it might open up the rest of the reservoir that available in patrol. (They added more than what was in the mission and it’s pretty big. Figured this out by getting out of the map.) and I’m not talking about the strike area of the reservoir, there is a door that’s blocked by taken energy in the boss room that leads to a much bigger part of the reservoir that’s kinda like a small jumping puzzle. 

Another thing I think might happen is the hawkmoon mission area in the sludge lost sector (forgot the name) may open up and maybe the captain flees to that area. 

There is also enemies throughout the reservoir that are blocked off by doors 

this might not be anything but it’s something I haven’t seen anyone else talk about.",1607651418,2020-12-10 20:50:18

raidsecrets,Deep Stone Crypt: The Double Restricted Special,"It may be entirely pointless, but I've managed to get a fireteam split between both versions of Restricted in Deep Stone Crypt. Restricted 1.0 being pre-crash, and Restricted 2.0 post crash. They occupy the same physical space, leading to lots of fun visual effects. There's no real benefit since as soon as you start the encounter, everyone in Restricted 1.0 gets joining allies'd back to 2.0. 'Course one never really knows if there won't be a bug with that down the line, but for now it's just a nice party trick.

Originally I tried expanding on my [previous](https://youtu.be/1y5a-MmMfmE) efforts. In my last attempt, I managed to successfully navigate the white void and reach Clarity Control, however this just left me in the Clarity Control/Rapture trap, with no way to continue. I intended to try never entering the third encounter area so I'd have a respawn point outside of the map, however plans changed after an unfortunate wipe. Luckily I managed to evade both death, and the blinding white trap of post-encounter Rapture by loading Clarity Control during the escape phase.

Check out my guide on that here: [https://youtu.be/1y5a-MmMfmE](https://youtu.be/1y5a-MmMfmE)

raidsecrets,Deep Stone Crypt symbols match Mind-Body Dualism,"Not sure if this has been mentioned but one of the symbols in the Clovis Bray mysterious log book (that is also seen around the Bray installations on Europa) bears striking resemblance to  René Descartes' illustration of mind/body dualism. 

[This is the image in question](https://imgur.com/a/NceMrj1) 

René Descartes' (who famously said ""I think, therefore I am"") believed inputs were passed on by the sensory organs to the epiphysis in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit. [Dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism) itself differs from Monism in that it assumes the Mind and Body are distinct non-identical entities as opposed to manifestations of a single substance.

This is something known as the [Mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem) 

&gt;*The* ***mind–body problem*** *is a debate concerning the relationship between thought and* *consciousness* *in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically, as that question presupposes an* *interactionist* *account of mind–body relations. This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature* 

So clearly this was an important problem in the field of Exo science as in Destiny there is clearly a duality between the human mind and the Exo body.

The image above stuck in my head because of the hourglass because after hearing ""an hourglass counting down with infinite patience"", this was actually the first reference to an hourglass in-game that I have encountered.

You can see further imagery from Descartes' papers [here](https://www.thinglink.com/scene/898624233008005120) and [here](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:61027:20160525060914341-0931:07916fig5_1.png?pub-status=live).

Now one thing I noticed is that in Descartes' image all the lines point to an arrow but in Clovis Bray's diagram they point to an hourglass. The arrow reminded me of the [arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time) (*time's arrow, the concept positing the ""one-way direction"" or ""asymmetry"" of* *time*) and in particular [Entropy as an arrow of time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(arrow_of_time))

&gt;**E****ntropy** is one of the few quantities in the physical sciences that require a particular direction for time, sometimes called an arrow of time. As one goes ""forward"" in time, the second law of thermodynamics says, the entropy of an isolated system can increase, but not decrease.  

My research led me to a very interesting paper from Yale University entitled ""[The Mind Body Problem and The Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://www.newdualism.org/papers/H.Morowitz/Morowitz-1987.htm)"". Within it seemed to confirm my suspicions about the arrow:

&gt;*The picture Descartes offers is that of the soul directly moving the pineal gland and thus affecting the ""animal spirits"" which he considered the hydraulic transmission system of mechanical changes in the body; consonant with his views on the conservation of motion,* ***it is only the direction****, and not the speed, of movement* ***of these spirits that is affected by the soul****.* ***This is the direction of action of the*** ***will.*** *In the opposite direction, changes in the body - such as the effect of external objects in the sense organs - are transmitted to the pineal gland by the spirits and can there affect the soul by causing sensations in it.* 

The Cartesian view of mind-body dualism is the idea that the activities of the mind cannot violate the conservation laws of physics but only effect choices, i.e., direction. Makes sense.

But the real clincher was in the abstract:

&gt;*Cartesian mind body dualism and modern versions of this viewpoint posit a mind thermodynamically unrelated to the body but informationally interactive. The relation between information and entropy demonstrates that any information about the state of a system has entropic consequences.* ***It is therefore impossible to dissociate the mind's information from the body's entropy****.* ***Knowledge of that state of the system*** *without an* ***energetically significant measurement*** *would* ***lead to a violation of the second law of thermodynamics****.* 

# It is impossible to dissociate the mind's information from the body's entropy.

In other words entropy and its associated arrow of time is a significant barrier to dissociating the mind from the body. Any information about the state of a system has entropic consequences and therefore if we try to read the state of the system without an energetically significant measurement it would in fact ***lead to a violation of the second law of thermodynamics****.* 

Now the nature of this **energetically significant measurement** is detailed further in the paper. It came in the form of a thought problem known as Maxwell's demon or the sorting demon.

&gt;*. . . imagine a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in his course, and would be able to do what is at present impossible to us . . . Let us suppose that a vessel is divided into two portions, A and B by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being who can see the individual molecules opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from A to B, and and only the slower ones to pass from B to A. He will, thus, without expenditure of work raise the temperature of B and lower that of A, in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.*  
&gt;  
&gt;For many years the paradox of the demon troubled students of the foundations of physics.

So in other words, if such a demon existed with the ability to see the individual molecules they would be able to make heat flow from two gases in thermal equilibrium in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

A man named Brillouin later solved the paradox. He showed that even if such a demon existed and regardless of how sharp it's faculties were - every time it observed a molecule this would release a minimum amount of energy (since radiation is quantized).

In simple terms, that means:  

# The act of the measurement requires the expenditure of energy equal or greater than that recoverable from the supposed violation of the second law, thus restoring the range of that law. 

So basically once we took into consideration that the act of measurement in itself expended energy - the whole problem no longer violates the second law of thermodynamics. Paradox solved! 

But that kinda sucks if you are trying to *dissociate the mind's information from the body's entropy* in order to seed an Exo mind - because as I mentioned this is IMPOSSIBLE to do without **violating the second law of thermodynamics**. But what if there was some version of this demon that could violate the second law of thermodynamics and measure without that expenditure of energy in our universe?

Well I think Clovis found it.

# Clarity

I think that's why Clarity was so important to Clovis and why the symbol is an hourglass and not an arrow. You see from the mysterious logbook we know that Clarity has the effect of irreversibly lowering the entropy of a substance in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, a phenomenon we see in Stasis (read [Stasis does not create Ice. It creates Perfect Crystals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k0mr5c/stasis_does_not_create_ice_it_creates_perfect/)). 

It's the missing piece of the puzzle he needed to transfer consciousness to the Exo minds.

# That's why it's an hourglass!

An arrow can only move in one direction in both space and time. An hourglass on the other hand can be reversed in both space and time by simply turning it around. An hourglass represented a perfect duality between the natural entropy of the universe, and the reverse entropy of Clarity. Two reversed arrows in time combined to form an hourglass.

I hypothesized almost 2 weeks ago that [Clarity is a Maxwellian Demon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k1dugp/clarity_is_a_maxwellian_demon/) because it seemingly violated the second law of thermodynamics when it reduced the entropy in the Radiolaria as well as when we use Stasis. 

But I think this is much bigger than that - Clarity solves the **Mind Body Problem**.

Without Clarity, Exominds **cannot** exist.",1607488980,2020-12-08 23:43:00

So, I went in with Hawkmoon and managed to get the 7 stacks and used bubble for extra DPS, but I wasn't able to kill it solo. I'm wondering if you need to bring extra people and everyone shoots it with one shot of the Hawkmoon with full stacks.

Here's some images of what I'm talking about. First image is just it being there still after immunity bubble is gone, second image is the amount of damage I was able to do with one shot and a grenade.

raidsecrets,Guided Games are Either Bugged or Completely Broken," Today guided games were added to Deep Stone Crypt, and my clan decided to guide one for the shits of it. Since Last Wish, Bungie stopped giving out emblems for being a guide which made me have no motivation to do them at all. But when we hopped in DSC, we were shocked by what happened.

Ressurection tokens were gone, and you could just res whenever you want, nobody needed to help you out. It was a darkness zone, but even if everyone died you could just res yourself and stop the wipe.

No loot was gained from any encounter, and at the final boss, we were instantly sent to the boss after completing the raid. We didn't even get Spoils of Conquest. The raid counted on [raid.report](https://raid.report/), but not actually inside the game. Our tracker still said 0 Deep Stone Crypt guided games.

Our group was split on if this was a bug or national to help new players through the raid, but personally, I believe it was a bug. Unless I missed something in the patch notes this was not said anywhere that GGs would be changed. Although, it is very possible that it is intentional, as even though the raid is almost a cakewalk with these rules, you get no loot meaning that the endgame chase is still there.

So Bungie, if you're reading this it would be nice to receive some confirmation on what is actually happening. If I just missed this in the patch notes, sorry for the fluff post!

An important thing to have in mind if you drop like I do is to know that there is a killzone next to the wall so you have to move a bit sepparated. Once you are past the tubing section it is much easier to traverse.

Behind the locked doors in the boss room there seem to be a series of big rooms with rotors in them. The area looks pretty big and some corridors sprout from them.

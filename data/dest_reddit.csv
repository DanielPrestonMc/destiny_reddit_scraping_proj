DestinyTheGame,"The Darkness or Savathûn might be influencing Saladin, among other Gaurdians!","After seeing the arguement at the Helm this reset, I started to wonder if Saladin MIGHT be under the influence of the Darkness/Savathûn.. 

First off, all of his dialogue this season is WILD, dark and out there. He never fought during the Red War, and obviously feels a little guilty about that but using it at every turn to put down the idea of becoming allies with the Cabal seems odd. The Iron Lords wouldn't even give Dark Gaurdians/Warlods (different but similar) final deaths and were upset about Felwinter doing it, they just dont seem like the types to believe ""killing is the only option"". Also, the way Saladin threw the Psion from the wall was very dark. Enemies are enemies but causing unnecessary pain or fear isn't the Guardians' style. Saladin speaking about ""raz(ing) the Cabal Empire to ashes"" and saying the times of Gaurdians being gaurds and not invaders should change- sounds much more Warlord than Iron Lord to me.

To honestly think about it, the last thing Darkness or Savathûn would want would be for humanity to become allied with yet ANOTHER Species of Sol (the Eliksni House of Light well on its way to being the first). Savathûn has played tricks getting us at each others throats over and over, while the Darkness sent the communication about the power on Europa to the entire Sol System. Hive, Cabal, Humans, Fallen all saw the message and we have already gone to war with one of them over it. So not only does it seem like the last thing our enemies want is for us to make Allies (duh), but both Savathûn and The Darkness are making noticeable efforts to prevent it. AND we have seen the effects of Savathûn influencing the Vanguard already. Why wouldn't she want to put us against one another? Divide and conquer and all that..

But that's just how I have perceived things, maybe I've missed something or I'm sure there are reasons some people would believe Saladin could never become influenced. Either way I'd like to hear other supporting evidence or evidence to the contrary. It's awesome to have such a deeply rich lore and history we as a community can debate about.",1615996158,2021-03-17 11:49:18

DestinyTheGame,GM's being gated at 1325 power is pointless and stupid,"Before we start lets get some things out of the way. Being a casual or a hardcore player doesn't have anything to do with time commitment to the game. 

For instance: My son, a casual, loves destiny and plays a ridiculous amount. He's ready for GM's based almost solely on artifact level. He does do some of the easier pinnacles but he will never play a GM and will never step foot in Trials. Skill level-wise, he just isn't there. 

Now for myself, I'm a hardcore player. I love destiny but have super limited time to play. When I do play I enjoy a challenge. I enjoy making builds and formulating plans to beat challenging content including Trials. I am not GM ready. I may barely be GM ready by end of season based on my schedule and the fact that pvp is my passion in Destiny. 

My issue with GM's being gated at 1325 power level is fairly simple. 

**1325 power level is not a gauge for how skilled a player may be. It is only a number that portrays a persons time and dedication to the grind. That is all.**

I've seen people argue that GM's aren't for casuals. But their definition of casual for some reason involves the amount of time you have to play. That just isn't true. You can be a hardcore player with little time to play. You can be a casual with tons of time to play.

Either way, having GM's gated by a 1325 power cap really leaves out the hardcore players that don't have a lot of time to commit to the pinnacle grind. It's really an arbitrary number that Bungie made up to keep people grinding past the season pass levels.

On the flip side, Trials is gated almost completely by skill level. If you want the pinnacles and adept loot you have to be skilled enough. So I get my adept loot from Trials because of my skill level. There is no arbitrary number blocking me from attempting it. 

The same should go for GM's. GM's should be completely about build crafting, great teamplay and skill. But it currently isn't. My son, the 1325 casual, could jump into one and not be able to complete it. 

I, on the other hand, can definitely complete a GM but I'm not 1325 so I can't even try.

As a hardcore player that wants to play GM's, I currently can't based SOLELY on lack of time. I may make 1325 by end of season. We shall see.",1615995817,2021-03-17 11:43:37

DestinyTheGame,There should be an option in the stasis subclass menu that let's you choose how your super behaves in PvE.,"I love the addition of Stasis in PvE and how customisable it is, but I feel like the supers are very limiting in their utility. For example, the hunter stasis super is great at ad clear but not very good at dps because the stasis tornado prioritised ads over the most powerful combatant on the field. The titan stasis super is again, fantastic at ad clear and just completely controlling the battlefield, but by nature of being a roaming super, it isn't that great at boss dps. The warlock super seems like a nice balance of ad clear and dps, but there could definitely be much more in the way of support utility.

I would love to see a setting in the subclass menu that allows you to modify the behaviour of the super. For example, there should be a setting for the hunter stasis super that allows you to modify the behaviour of the stasis tornado so that it prioritises the most powerful combatant on the field over the ads so you can do big damage by combining the tick damage of the tornado with special or heavy weapons fire. For titans, it could modify the super where there's a freeze on cast, and then one big punch attack for big burst dps on a boss with a decently large detonation radius to get ads near the boss with shatter damage. The warlock super is decent at sustained dps, but there could be an option for either higher damage detonations at the cost of more super energy, or perhaps a support behaviour where casting a light attack on a fireteam member gives that fireteam member a regenerating overshield that doesn't last as long or regenerate as fast as solar well super, but allows the team mates to be mobile instead of standing in a given area, or even something similar to the void hunter tether where its a single freeze attack that hits for large damage on cast and then debuffs bosses so they receive more damage, and to differentiate from tether, it could be a debuff that gives extra damage to light based attacks and supers, so you can have good team synergy with someone running ad clear, the warlock casts on the boss, then another player using a burst damage super like thundercrash or golden gun for biiiig burst dps.",1615994328,2021-03-17 11:18:48
DestinyTheGame,The Unknown Solo Flawless Prophecy Meta (a Guide),"Recently, I decided to tackle solo flawless prophecy. That emblem is just too cool. I'm a solidly above average player, maybe even good - I've failed Day 1 raids, solo flawlessed Pit (with ball duping\*), and have done a solid number of raid runs. But I'm certainly not elite. So, I wanted to figure out the easiest loadout/strategy for actually getting it done. Online guides seemed like a solid start.

So, I went about and read all the guides available online - most from before Beyond Light. Most of them said to use some combination of Anarchy, Mountaintop, Blinding Grenade Truthteller, Xeno, Witherhoard, etc. That seemed reasonable to me – Anarchy/Witherhoard are great DPS options for the kell echo, Xenophage melts knights, blinding grenades can help with the adds, and so on. Then when I was actually trying it, I felt like I was trying to juggle too much in my head to maintain staying alive. Especially in the beginning of the encounters with all the adds spawning at once, I just couldn’t get the encounter under control quick enough to stay alive. Mote timers, managing add/boss positioning, not dying to adds and clearing them before psions split too many times, and so on.

I thought to myself, how can I make this a bit easier? I decided that at the end of the day, all the encounters are a lot more manageable if you completely delete the minor adds from the equation. On the phalanx, you only have to worry about knights and the boss so it’s a lot easier to find pockets to heal yourself without psions peppering you with little shots all the time. In the cube, likewise if you’re only worried about the knights/hobgoblins, no acolytes and such, the encounter is trivial. For the final boss, I felt like DPS was always a pretty easy part and I didn’t mind doing a ton of phases as long as I could get through the initial rooms reliably – and in that room, again, only worrying about the kell echo copies and knights would make it a lot easier. 

So that all sounds great, and the loadout was pretty apparent: I needed add clear. So I started testing some runs with Trinity Ghoul as the exotic of choice.

The result is this guide. I included a lot of encounter guide text/tips, because there are certain small details that I realized are key to making the encounters manageable, or even easy, as I continued to do runs.

# The Loadout

**Kinetic: Heritage w/ Reconstruction (sub: Sniper for wasteland if desired)**

Heritage will be your main knight killer – that’ll be pretty much its sole purpose. Within range, it’ll stagger knights on a precision hit and takes two precisions or one precision two body to kill the knights.

**Energy: Trinity Ghoul w/ Completed Catalyst (mandatory)**

Your add deleter. However, it’s important to know how to make use of Trinity Ghoul since it isn’t really like any other weapon. If lightning rod isn’t procced, your first goal is to kill an add with it ADS/hipfire – you’ll have to aim. Once it **is** procced, your goal is to keep it procced. For enemies that take more than one shot to kill (hobgoblins in cube, for instance), make sure you still kill it with Trinity to get the perk to proc again. The biggest benefit of lightning rod is that it’ll remove entire groups of psions while hardly aiming – even if they’ve split a million times. Once lightning rod is procced, you really shouldn’t be ADSing all that much. If you have the extra time to, sure, go ahead, but at the beginning of encounters with a lot of hectic adds, don’t. In fact, don’t even fully draw the arrow. The arrows don’t need to hit or do maximum damage, they’re really just vehicles for your palpatine energy. In fact, less draw lets them spread out more. Using it this way is what really lets you focus on the other parts of the encounters – mechanics, staying alive, and knights – without really worrying about the adds. As long as every shot kills at least one enemy, as long as you don’t completely whiff on a very forgiving shot, lightning rod will remain procced.

**Heavy: Falling Guillotine (sub: Machine Gun for wasteland if desired)**

Your DPS. Can be used for knights if they’re standing in the right light in cube, but wouldn’t risk it for other encounters.

# Armor

We’ll be deleting adds as soon as they spawn, for the most part, but getting to the point where the knights/bosses are all that remains requires some good survivability. Because we’re running TG, we don’t have a reliable way of spawning warmind cells. So we go all in with a Protective Light build:

2x Void Armor: Protective Light, Stacks on Stacks

2x Solar Armor: Supercharged, Charged Up/Supercharged

Any Armor: Taking Charge

Class Item: Passive Guard (optional, makes DPS easier)

Taking Charge is great here because Trinity Ghoul is an orb making machine. Rarely should you go lower than 4x stacks with the above loadout unless your shields have just broken, in which case you’ll have 20+ seconds to heal and go make more orbs.

**The rest below will focus encounter strategy, with some Warlock specific notes (I highly recommend Warlock for the easiest solo flawless runs due to devour and well).**

# Encounter Notes

# Initial Caves

This is pretty easy, clear the thrall with trinity ghoul to get some orbs for protective light and then go ape the knights. Use the last 2 knights in the first area (after a respawn) to bring dark motes into the second area since that’s much easier than making dark motes within the second part.

# Phalanx 

**Subclass, Mods:** Well of Radiance, 2x Concussive Dampener

**Adds**: 

· Four knights – they only respawn when all four are killed

· Groups of psions spawn every time motes are dunked

· Goblins spawn halfwayish through DPS

**General Notes:**

Like other guides recommend, for the majority of this encounter you’ll be running loops around the edge. Trinity Ghoul will delete psions in groups very easily and make plenty of orbs of light to maintain protective light’s availability. When all four knights are up, try to take one out with trinity ghoul before trying to shotgun them. Rushing four with heritage gets dicey, even with protective light. Trinity ghoul is nice here because without having to aim, it’s pretty easy to keep on the move and quickly turn towards the groups of enemies and fire off some lightning.

On that note, since the knights spawn separated a bit, it can be easy to immediately take one out as it spawns with heritage which makes it all more manageable (do this every time they respawn).

Anyway, pre-dps cycle goes like this: kill psions with Trinity Ghoul, picking off a knight with heritage if the opportunity arises in a relatively safeish area, ensure you have stacks of CwL, shotgun 1-2 more knights to get the motes required to dunk, go dunk, and repeat.

Remember none of the adds are on a timer in this encounter. In a pinch, you can always just drop your well and then delay DPS until you have it back up.

Only other tip is if you get booped off, try and turn around and glide towards the edge. You’ll get “joining allies” and should be able to delay until the timer runs out – but you’ll lose CwL stacks and lightning rod.

**DPS Notes:** 

As other guides mention, drop a well so goblins can’t shield, and lay into the phalanx with your sword. This will result in a 2-phase after the sword nerfs. If you want to 1-phase (it’s tight), you can take a quarter to a third of the phalanx’s health off before dropping the well (using passive guard, concussive dampener, and protective light to stay alive), then drop the well and continue DPS. If you’re 2 phasing, feel free to rip into the goblins with your sword once the phalanx only has a third or so of its health left – the multikills will create a bunch of orbs for CwL.

# Wasteland

**Subclass, Mods:** Well of Radiance or Devour Voidlock, 1x Sniper 1x Concussive

**Adds**: 

· Groups of thrall at each set of bubbles

· 3x Hobgoblins on pillars at each set of bubbles

· 3x of varying major adds at each set of bubbles – Captains, Phalanxes, Hobgoblins, Centurions, etc.

**General Notes:**

A nice easy break after the phalanx, just don’t turn your brain off. Usually there’s a minotaur somewhere nearby the bubbles – you don’t necessarily have to kill it, but be wary of it. Start each set of bubbles by picking the hobgoblins off at a distance with TG. Then you can either drop a well near the major adds and shotgun/sword them, or proc devour and go at them. Use the thrall to keep devour procced as needed (TG or sword works). Just take it slow. You can also swap to a sniper and pick off majors from distance too.

# Cube

**Subclass, Mods:** Devour Voidlock, 1x Sniper 1x Concussive

**Adds:**

· 2x groups of acolytes at beginning of each room and then on a timer

· 2x Major Hobgoblins / 2x Major Knights – kill hobgoblin, knight spawns; kill knight, hobgoblin spawns

**General Notes:**

Surprisingly not too bad of an encounter with devour coupled with trinity ghoul. At the start of each room, quickly check what mote type you need and then go into one of the corners (try and choose one with a pillar or two for cover from hobgoblins but don’t worry too much). While going to that corner, proc devour with your grenade.

Once in the corner, use trinity ghoul (which is hopefully already procced) to quickly eliminate the majority of the acolytes before too many eyes spawn. This will also make a ton of orbs for CwL and keep your health high from devour.

Next, use 2-3 ADS trinity ghoul shots to take out each hobgoblin. If all arrows crit, it’ll only take two. You should be left with only the two knights left, which is easy to manage. If you’re feeling confident, didn’t take a long time clearing the adds/hobgoblins, and the knights are sitting in or are near the right light, just go sword/shotgun them real quick before the next group of adds spawn. Otherwise, just whiddle their health down and let the next group of acolytes spawn, kill them (trinity ghoul), then you have plenty of time for the knights.

Try to end each room with (1) lightning rod procced, (2) at least 4x CwL stacks, and (3) grenade up for devour. If you do all that, surviving the first part of each room is trivial, and once you have the adds and hobgolbins gone, it’s no harder than the first encounter (before the phalanx).

**DPS:**

Please, just nova one of the centurions and then sword to finish and sword the other. No tricks needed, it’s cheese.

# Wasteland Pt 2

Only giving this a section to mention sparrow to the rainbow road using the ridge to the left to shield you from where the adds spawn (bow out a bit to the left). Worst part of a solo flawless run would be dying because the adds spawn and explode your sparrow.

# Rainbow Road

I see a lot of advice to take the platforms and jump down – which sure, do that if that’s what you’re comfortable with. But the only time I did that I missed a jump and died, since I had never gone that route and was used to sparrowing. So I just sparrowed it as normal, with the caveat where any time I felt even a little dicey I (a) stopped boosting or (b) jumped off sparrow and glided to middle of track.

Use the thrall at the end to proc lighting rod and get max CwL stacks.

# Kell Echo

**Subclass, Mods:** Devour Voidlock, 2x Concussive, Sword and Shotgun ammo finders

**Adds:** 

· 2x Knights, respawn whenever one killed

· 3x groups of psions, respawn on timer

· Ogre whenever deleting a kell echo

· Sets of 2x hobgoblins during DPS that spawn as boss teleports each time

**General Notes:**

Perhaps the 2nd hardest encounter, which is annoying since it comes at the end. The **most** important thing is to start each non-DPS room with max CwL stacks, a grenade for devour, and ideally lightning rod procced (though you can get by without that).

You goal on entering a room is to go to the cover along one of the triangle edges, proc devour while adds are spawning in, then palpatine the shit out of all of the psions. Ignore the knights.

Once the psions are all dead, quickly go shotgun the knights. Unless you have 3 of the same required mote type, it doesn’t matter where they’re standing as long as you get the same type of mote from each. Immediately go dunk them – deleting a single kell echo makes the room very manageable.

After the first dunk, you should be able to reproc devour and sword the ogre. If more psions are spawning by now, go shotgun the other 2 knights – try and do so within the devour window. If they are, kill them first and then do the knights. With only a single kell echo left, you should be able to shotgun the knights and dunk it before the third wave of psions spawn. No biggie if not, since with only one kell echo, there’s plenty of safer areas and you have palpatine on your side. Just try not to dunk with a hoarde of psions around you.

So, just remember: sword ogres as they spawn, keep devour up as much as possible (not as difficult as it seems with trinity ghoul and shotgunning a knight down only taking 2-3 shots), if you need a breather chill in an area you already dunked with devour up.

Remember there’s no timer so before going down to DPS, you can always wait for psions to spawn and farm ammo. Like with the phalanx, if you’re caught without a grenade and need/want devour to proc, don’t hesitate to nova bomb some psions or knights. You can always DPS without it or wait to DPS until its back up.

**DPS:**

Before getting to the nitty gritty details of how to run this, the general flow is: stay **ahead** of the boss, kill hobgoblins as they spawn, avoid boss teleport attacks, and then DPS with sword at the end.

As you enter the room, nova bomb the boss. It’ll take a few tries to get used to the aim, but after that it’s always the same and a good way to start DPS off. Then immediately jump to the left platform (where the first hobgoblin will spawn in) while avoiding the boss’s teleport. On this platform, the short little pillar will shield you from his teleport for the most part. When the hobgoblins spawn in, shotgun the one on the platform you’re at and a single TG shot should kill the one across. The boss will teleport shortly after that.

When he teleports, you should be able to pick off at least one (preferably both) of the two new hobgoblins before he uses the teleport attack. You basically have time to get two bow shots off. Once you do, jump diagnolly right and finish off a hobgoblin if left over. Spend the rest of the time until more hobgoblins spawn in avoiding the boss’s teleport.

Continue this all the way down the room. You should be using the lull during his teleports to pick off hobgoblins, and then when you hear him do the teleport attack, jump up ahead to be closer to him or even past him. There should never be more than two hobgoblins up at a time, and ideally even when there is two only one should be able to get a shot off. While jumping down the room, don’t worry about DPS – at most, just throw a grenade or pepper him with some bow shots if you have time.

Once the last hobgoblins are up on the final platform, kill them with TG but don’t shoot TG anymore at the boss – you want the lightning rod for the next room. If you’re quick, you can create an orb of light while killing them – save this orb to get CwL just prior to going back up the lift.

You should be getting to the final platform **before** the boss. Once the boss teleports to the final platform, just go sword him – I only used light attacks for consistency. If you can, attack him from an angle such that his stomp – if it does happen to bounce you – only bounces you up the steps rather than off the map. With the combination of 2x concussive, passive guard, and protective light (if your shield breaks), you don’t need any healing to do damage. In fact, you can sometimes finish without even having your shields broken.

Using this DPS structure – Nova Bomb, then minimal damage until sword on last teleport – you should be getting 20-30% of damage each phase. That’s not ideal for a solo flawless – with other loadouts some people reliably 3-phase – but again, the goal here is surviving in the other rooms. Which this loadout excels at. 4-5 Phasing isn't too bad given how much easier TG and devour makes the first room.

Once the boss leaves, don't leave the room until your grenade is up. You can take some time to gather yourself as well, your CwL and lightning rod doesn't have a timer so if you need a bit of time take it.

The only run killer in the DPS room I’ll mention is panicking while getting teleported. You **will** mess up and get teleported at some point – that’s no big deal. You can catch up, and usually still beat the boss to the final platform. What **is** a big deal is panicking when it happens. If you get hit, immediately stop pressing any buttons until your vision comes back. You don’t want to accidentally drop off a ledge.

If you somehow get teleported mid sword swing – it happened once or twice to me – you may come back midair. In this case, strafe guide and pressing it immediately when your vision comes back will let you safely get back to a platform (may have to mantle).

DestinyTheGame,Riskrunner visual nerf and Keratoconus,"Hey Bungie. Not sure if you'll see this, but just wanted to send a simple thank you for nerfing the visual insanity which was Riskrunner; also an apology to those who enjoyed it, as it gets nerfed on behalf of people like me (lol). I know this change was primarily intended for seizures, but as a person with rapidly worsening keratoconus, this change is a lifesaver...er, eyesaver. Yeah.

I already play at 1 brightness on PC with night light enabled, or flux, whatever you'd like to refer to it as. It sucks, I wouldn't recommend it. Long story short, Riskrunner has always been my favorite weapon in the game. I've been using it since launch. The power of the visual effect really became apparent to me when Devil's Lair was reissued. It was the first time I had to take breaks from playing the game due to my eyes. It's a very flashy game in general, so I'm not solely blaming the Riskrunner for my discomfort...but GOD DAMN the tune y'all applied really makes my life a lot easier. Again, sorry to the folks who loved how badass that chain lightning was, but thank u Bungie...even if it wasn't directly meant for me. Good shit. Would be cool if you could toggle the effect for all my peeps who may miss it. I think you'll be thanking Bungie for sparing your corneas later, though.",1615994117,2021-03-17 11:15:17

Meanwhile, opponents can stand, dance, or even have a tea party in my rift with no consequences! Shouldn’t they take damage as well or at least be slowed, blinded, or suppressed?

DestinyTheGame,Getting back into the game. What could I miss?,"So I had played destiny a couple of years ago, and I am starting to play again. As a solo player I had mainly played the activities that had matchmaking (Crusible, Strikes, Gambit), although I remember doing the weekly Nightfall (i think using the app) and once doing a raid (again through the app) but having no idea of what to do and basically following others instructions. 

Recently I started playing again. I did a couple of missions that are intro to the new expansions, noticed there is a battle pass and for some reason secondary weapons have shotguns and snipers. I also noticed that the app for finding teams is still around.

My main question is about activities I could be missing. Is there anything new like the gambit was shortly before I stopped playing ? Is there a faster way to grow my power level than doing bointies daily getting new gear? And finally how much worth is are the expansions and the battle pass. Do they add anything new to the game other than story/items ? 

Thanks in advance.

DestinyTheGame,Constantly “fixing” the DSC sparrow section sucks. It was a poorly designed area and people skipping it is clearly evident of that. Now I have zero reason to log into the game anymore.,"Why are you so focused on forcing us to do your stupid sparrow run? Look I like the concept, I really do. And the SOTP sparrow run was simply amazing! (And way harder to cheese). It was really fun, the first time. After that this section is tedious and overly unforgiving. But doing this sparrow run legit every week is so uninteresting to me that I’ll just not do it. (Funny, sounds a lot like the state of Trials as well!!!)

But after patching what is now like 2 or 3 cheeses you STILL cannot stop us from doing this? Well what do ya know, you can still cheese the event glitching out of the map now. Give up. Move on.

These “fixes” don’t even fix what your trying to fix either. I get that you want people to “experience” your glorious raid *the right way*. But there is nothing stopping someone from running it solo, then inviting everyone else back at the security CP. Thus skipping the entire section anyways. Because LFG looks like this now, “DSC at security CP KWTD.”

What is so terrible about solo players (WHO HAVE TO UNLOCK THE GEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE, AKA COMPLETE THE RAID, IN ORDER TO EVEN GET DROPS FROM CHEST) getting 3 chances at quite frankly the only loot worth a damn in the game currently. I have been doing the cheese, 3 x per week, every week since BL and guess what? Still no god rolls from the raid weapons. And I raid too. I have Eyes of Tomorrow (which took a lot of runs to get). With how abysmal RNG is weighted in this game, what are you dinguses so afraid of? Oh god, no, not random blueberry 43 getting 10 raid tokens and 1 piece of random loot that is statistically going to be dog shit anyways. /s

You don’t want people to cheese your shit? Start rewarding your players time investment, add more desirable loot to the general loot pool and make encounters that don’t completely suck to do 3 times a week, every single week. FFS.",1615992487,2021-03-17 10:48:07

DestinyTheGame,"All joking aside, the story direction is and has been provoking some great discussion.","I mean, look at where we are now. In Destiny 1 we conquered the Vault, repelled crota's incursion, then oryx and discovered the taken. Then we dealt with the scourge of the Iron Lords, SIVA. 

Then comes Destiny 2, you have the red War knocking us on our asses, stripping our light, and introducing us to the full might of the cabal empire. We would go on to discover more secrets, go through the loss of cayde 6, discover more about the awoken and learn a little bit about paracausal entities. All while fighting these supposedly mindless, faceless, brutal enemies. 

Now we've teased and tasted the darkness, dealt with the Fallout of the red War being the almighty, and the Darkness has arrived.

Now we are dealing with eliksni and cabal essentially trying to establish new homes in our solar system all while contending with the arrival of the dark Fleet.

I think that the conversations we are having, mirrored by some of the Battlegrounds banter between Crow, Osiris, Saladin, holiday are all incredibly poignant.

How far are we going to go to assure Humanity survival? Which strategy do we take? Obviously I think we're building towards an alliance between eliksni, Cabal and Guardians. But it remains interesting to see where people draw their lines in the discussion.

It's interesting to see that we have Guardians siding with Crow and saying that these are just other sentient beings trying to survive, then you have players who have survived the events of the past stating that they remain jaded towards the Fallen and towards the Cabal.

Just got to give props to the story team because these discussions(though they do seem like arguments that times) are definitely thought-provoking.

DestinyTheGame,Eyes of Tomorrow Still Without Its Intended Buff,"Eyes of Tomorrow was slated to have a buff at the start of season 13 however we did not get that, quite the opposite which was a ""stealth nerf"" that Bungie came out and said this was unintended and is in fact a bug. We are a month and some change into S13 and it has still not been addressed. I was hoping with the fix to Dunemarchers, Bungie would have also added in that Eyes did receive its buff.  


I am assuming Bungie is afraid of this exotic overperforming in certain areas of the game so they are just playing the field a little and must be seeing if there even needs to be a change. Here's hoping we hear something about it soon. I really liked the idea of Bungie bringing back raid exotics that aren't tied to a quest but Eyes is so underwhelming in endgame content that when I hear some of my clan mates talk about how they still have not got one after 30-40+ clears I can't help but be sorry.

I'd compare it to any weekly tv show, which more and more people are being exposed to thanks to shows like The Mandalorian and Wandavision.

DestinyTheGame,Trials of Osiris......the solution,"Okay trials is in and abysmal state at the moment... You know it, I know it everybody knows it.

But here is an option that may fix some of the problems....

Okay a majority of trials matches consist of every player running up and using a sword or an emote to peek around corners and then it becomes a stalemate we're both teams wait for the other one to push and then they proceed to eradicate the other team with one hit kill weapons (shotguns,snipers...etc)..

However if you put heavy on a timer and (don't freak out).. special on a timer that would force each team not only to use primary weapon battles... But it would also force them to strategize a way to rotate and secure special ammo to the player that it would be most beneficial....(I have a friend of mine who is a much better sniper than I am so it would be a logical situation for them to pull special ammo for the sniper)..

Now what a lot of players also do is they hang back in the back of the map and wait for their super to build.. well that's a fine strategy if that's the way you want to play however in what I'm about to propose that will eliminate that entire situation.... Place a rift that's on a timer and only one player can get the rift which instantly charges the super.. now keep in mind these are just options these are options that would slow down play but it would force engagement with primary weapons...

Now game type:
What is stated above would fit into team deathmatch(first to 50),.

Now the timers and everything would have to be adjusted for capture the flag (instead of capture the flag capture the rift. With the same basic CTF rules)..

Oddball: basically a big game of keep away the longer you have the rift the more points you accumulate.

Elimination: current timers and rules apply
(For this game mode elimination is pretty much spot on)

Control. Control is pretty solid... The only thing that I would do is change the special ammo to put that on a timer and rifts (insta-supers) as a one-time charge about three quarters of the way through the match...

And LOOT!!!!!!
HAVE TWO POOLS OF LOOT

THE FIRST POOL OF LOOT IS FOR JUST PLAYING THE GAME KIND OF LIKE HOW INFAMY AND VALOR ALL WORK.. THE MORE YOU PROGRESS THE MORE DIFFERENT  KINDS OF LOOT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET.... Keep it simple old trials armor stuff that you would normally find in regular PVP playlist....

THEN THE SECOND LOOT POOL:
THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO GET LOOT FROM... HIGH STAT ROLL ARMOR OR A UMBRAL ENGRAM THAT IS FREE FOR YOU TO FOCUS. ON WHATEVER STAT THAT YOU NEED...


IN A NUTSHELL TRIALS NEEDS AN ENEMA..... IT NEEDS A GOOD SOLID CLEANING.. AND KEEP IN MIND I'M NOT SAYING THAT ALL THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE DIRECTLY TO A TEE .....EXACTLY HOW I SAY IT.. BUT THIS IS AN OPTION THAT COULD FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT'S PLAGUING TRIALS AND COMPETITIVE .......ACTUALLY PVP IN GENERAL

I JUST REALLY LIKE THIS GAME AND I PLAYED COMPETITIVE HALO FOR YEARS GROWING UP WATCHING IT ON TV AND ON STREAMS... ACTUALLY GETTING GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY AGAINST SOME OF THE BEST.. WASHY, THE OGRES (1&amp;2), LUNCH BOX,ROY, GANDHI.... I CAN GO ON AND ON..

IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IN REGARDS TO THE PLAYLISTS AND HOW THE GAME ACTUALLY PLAYS... PLAY THE MASTER CHIEF COLLECTION... OR FIRE UP THE OLD XBOX 360 LOAD UP HALO 2 OR HALO 3..

DestinyTheGame,Cayde-6.,"What can a more interesting title than that? Lol. Cayde-6 is probably the biggest click-bait for us guardians. We devour every little gossip or discussion about him no matter how small. OK to the point.

I do not know if there is a thread for this exact discussion or something very similar and sorry I didn't look for it. We all might have accepted that Bungie has made it clear Cayde isn't coming back. Did they say it? Or have they somehow very indirectly implied that there is an almost certain chance of him not coming back? But let me just say, Uldren Sov. 

Why is he back? I know he has been back for over 4 months so why am I discussing this now, bit slow on the realisation there. And if anything is true the fact that he now has a conscience is something we cannot deny. What will happen when he is truly unmasked? What will happen when he realises just what he has taken from us? Taken!! I don't think remorse is an emotion to be taken lightly. Why did the traveller bring him back? Will he do anything possible in his power to bring back Cayde?

I know I sound like a cultist devoted to bringing back Cayde-6. But if lightfall is coming then what better way to prevent it than a reunited vanguard? What better way to tether us to light than an old friend? But then again Uldren Sov can always turn to darkness on his path to Cayde and everything will fall apart. And if the voice actor of Cayde doesn't want his old job back, everything will fall apart too.",1615988166,2021-03-17 09:36:06

Did my first GM this season last night ... Wow is that a ton of enemies ....

Weapon Loads

* Primary - Sniper 
* Energy - Bow (Arc/Void/Solar)
* Heavy - Anarchy , Arc Machine Gun , Void Rocket / Machine Gun

Armor Load Out Mods

* Helmet - Sniper and Heavy Finder Mods
* Arms - Anti Barrier Sniper , Overload Bows
* Chest - Sniper Resistance , Concussion Resistance
* Legs - Sniper and Heavy Specific Scrounger Mods
* Class Item - High Energy Fire / Shelter from the Void 

Notes

* Of course titan running Ursa and warlock running well do great in 1st and final boss room
* anarchy is great for 2nd area to take out the tank that caused the most wipes 
* Most other mods slots in armor where used for Charge with Light and raising Recovery or Resistance Stats to some level

DestinyTheGame,I’m no longer trying in Destiny’s PVP gamemodes. They can’t make me.,"Stasis in PVP is a mistake. A marketing move gone wrong. Bungie advertised Stasis as the next big thing in the game, and had to deliver on big. The result was the most unbalanced, unfun, and unimaginably frustrating thing to ever grace this PVP. Worse than pre-nerf one eyed mask. Worse than handheld supernova. Worse than a hunter with infinite spectral blades. 

There is simply nothing fun about not being able to fight back. Nothing at all. You can spam click the escape key all you want, but unless there’s a teammate nearby to clean up the attacker, you’re as good as dead. 

Stasis is just one head of the unholy Cerberus that plagues the PVP. An absolutely abysmal matchmaking system causes more than half of my PVP games to end with a mercy, with either my team slapping, or being slapped. The weapon meta is so strict that if you don’t follow it, you will lose. The number of one-hit-kill mechanics in this game make so many fights hit first or die first. 

As far as I’m concerned, aside from the weekly PvP games for the pinnacle, Destiny does not HAVE a PvP game mode. It simply does not exist. They can’t make me care about it, no matter how many quest steps require it.",1615985571,2021-03-17 08:52:51

DestinyTheGame,"So in the lore tab for The Swarm, recently released, Shaw Han does something new.","Re-posting to avoid spoiler in title.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-swarm

So in the new lore tab of The Swarm, Shaw Han and a couple Redjacks are defending a front in the Cosmodrome against an influx of Cabal.  Saladin shows up and helps him and the frames rally and push back.  Shaw Han then looks like he's about to cast another Golden Gun, but does something completely and totally new.

&gt;He pushes the bulk of his Light into his weapon, spreads its influence to reach the nearby Redjacks, and reignites his gun before touching the barrel to the ground and firing. The ground bubbles with hot magmatic Light; a warmth envelops the Redjacks as Solar flame imbues and empowers their rifles with golden power. Shaw directs the firestorm of golden Redjack rifles to incinerate every last charging foe. 

It's almost like he cast a Golden Gun style Well of Radiance, but for the Redjacks.  Has anyone been able to imbue their Light into other objects like this?  I was thinking that it maybe could also be a preview at a future support based Solar Hunter class?  Either way I don't think we've ever seen someone do something as different as Shaw Han just did though.",1615985321,2021-03-17 08:48:41

DestinyTheGame,I have an Idea: A Pinnacle Focus System,"Right, Everyone had that time where you were just needing that one pinnacle reward... and you don't get it to drop at all that week. It leaves you feeling irritated, your effort gone to waste... So I decided to think of a way to fix this.

#Introducing The Pinnacle Focusing System!#

The first change made by the introduction by this system would be that you would no longer recieve an item drop from completing a weekly pinnacle challenge but instead, You would be rewarded a Pinnacle Engram that would drop loot from said activities loot pool, excluding raids, dungeons and Trials.

These Pinnacle Engrams that are rewarded can be taken to the H.E.L.M and focused using the prismatic recaster on a separate page. (The Teir 3 Umbral Focusing options would be brought back to the first one, don't know why Bungie moved it in the first place.)

This second page would contain 4 rows of Focusing Options and a third page would be created to store two more for Prime Engrams: 

• 2 for focusing Pinnacle Engrams, with one row for weapons and one row for armour.

and

• 2 for focusing Powerful Engrams, once again one row for weapons and one row for armour

On the third page you would find 2 rows, again One for weapons and one for armour.


#On the weapons row you would have the following options:#
------------- Tier 1 -------------
• An Engram that guarantees a Weapon
------------- Tier 2 --‐----------
• An Engram that guarantees a Primary Weapon

• An Engram that guarantees an Energy Weapon

• An Engram that guarantees a Heavy Weapon

• An Engram that guarantees an Auto Rifle or a Pulse Rifle *

• An Engram that guarantees a Sniper Rifle or a Scout Rifle *

• An Engram that guarantees a Hand Cannon or a Sidearm *

• An Engram that guarantees an SMG or a Bow *

• An engram that guarantees a shotgun or Fusion Rifle *

• An Engram that guarantees either a Heavy or Special Grenade Launcher *

• An Engram that Guarantees a Rocket Launcher, A Machine Gun or a Sword. *
--------------- Tier 3 ------------------
• All the above options (Excluding Tier 1) but you can select either the first or second perk and the weapon drops masterworked.

(*: This option is only available if such activity has said weapon type in their loot pool.)

On the Armour row you would have the following option: 
---------------- Tier 1 ------------------
• An Engram that guarantees an Armour Piece
‐-----‐--------- Tier 2 ------------------
• An Engram that guarantees a Helmet

• An Engram that guarantees Gauntlets

• An Engram that guarantees a Chest Piece
 
• An Engram that guarantees a Leg Piece

• An Engram that guarantees a Class Item
----------------- Tier 3 ---------------
• All the above options (Excluding Random Armour)   but with high stat roll options for each.

#The Cost:#

To Focus these engrams, you would be required to obtain a Sigil of Service. This would be obtained through doing pinnacle challenges (One for each challenge), but if you want to obtain more they will have a chance to drop from activities like Raids, Nightfalls, Trials, Iron Banner, Ect with the chance to obtain one getting higher everytime it doesn't drop.

The price of the focus will be dependant on its tier:

Tier One drops are the most basic form of focusing and will only cost 20 legendary shards and one Sigil of Service.

Tier Two drops are more focused to a specific type of item and will be a bit more expensive, costing 50 legendary shards and 2 Sigils of Service.

Tier Three drops are some of the best options you can choose if your looking for god roll gear so they will be the most costly, requiring 100 legendary shards and 3 Sigils of Service.

#Connecting the H.E.L.M and The Tower#
I understand how mildly annoying it can be to have to go to the H.E.L.M to decrypt and Focus your Umbral Engrams but then have to load into the Tower to decrypt a Prime Engram with Rahool. So I would introduce a change where both the Umbral Decoder and Rahool can decrypt Prime Engrams. This removes a part of the problem when it comes to decoding your engrams while also keeping the purpose of both The H.E.L.M (The only place you can Decrypt Umbrals and Focus important Engrams) and The Tower (The only place to speak to Playlist Vendors such as Lord Shaxx, Commander Zavala and the Gunsmith Banshee-44) and to make it easier and (possibly) quicker to access, A banner would be placed near the hanger entrance that will allow you to load into the H.E.L.M and Vice Versa, In the H.E.L.M there would be a banner next to the door nearest the decoder that allows you to load into the Tower.

DestinyTheGame,"Suggestion for a new power leveling system, respects player time, feels natural and makes RNG feels less puniching","To put into perspective what the Power leveling system should become, we have to adress the issues of it current iterration

1. The Leveling system RN feels restrictive, both in its weekly lockout format

2. Leveling time commtment is RN better measured in how many weeks it took U to get there, not how many hours U spent playing the game

3. RNG is the biggest defactor of the current system

4. Leveling can be done anywhere by doing anything, requiring nothing of the player, and creating no progression

5. Higher level activities have basically no difference in leveling compared to other Easier PvE activities... In other words, the harder does not mean the better

How Can we adree this and acomplish what I set out to do when I wrote ths tittle

1. ***THE MOST IMPORTANT*** Remove the weekly lockout on THE POWERFUL grind

This change by itself makes no sense... But after I breakdown more changes It will make sense

2. Weekly Challenges are removed from the power leveling grind, and are reserved for ONLY pinnacle level grind. The powerful Level Grind is set as a 100 power level grind. ***I.e soft cap 1250 ---&gt; powerful cap 1350.***

3. Activities now reward powerful level loot based on the activities level, dropping a certain ammount of loot depending on activity 

• If the player's gear level is under the level of the activity the loot will drop as a +2

• If the player's gear level is higher compared to the activities level, then Loot will drop as a +1, upt to 20 levels above the activities power level

• example: 1310 level Ordeal.
▪︎Player Level 1250 (soft cap) ---&gt; 1309 - Loot on the end chest drops +2
▪︎Player Level 1310 ---&gt; 1330 - Loot drops as a +1
▪︎ Player Level 1331+ - Doesnt drop poweful, gear drops as +0

4. Loot now drops based on the Slots power level, not the players overall gear level. Prime engrams drop as +3 based on Slots level

5. Activities would display not only the range of their drops power level (I.e a level 1300 strike would Display: **""1310 max level rewards""**). Activities would also display the range of The ammount of rewards the activity can drop (strikes: ""2-3""; Crucible: ""1-2"", Gambit: ""2-3"")

6. Crucible based activities would have a Wider range of power levels.
• Casual: 1250 (soft cap) ---&gt; 1310 (will only offer +1 drops)
• Comp: 1310 ----&gt; 1350 (offering +1 drops)
• Iron Banner and trials can droo up to 1350 (+2 Drops)

7. Gambit will have a similar distribution to crucible, dropping +1 rewards as loot

8. Pinnacle loot drops would be the only ones to have weekly challenges associated with them, and weekly lockouts... But would still work by Slot leveling increases. Item's power is based on the the highest level of gear on that slot not overall powerlevel, Resulting in a more consistent Pinaccle leveling experience (also Maybe bad luck protection for slots already at the pinnacle cap)


***RESULTS***

This is all speculative,but a system like this is likely to create a better feeling leveling system, since it feels more like U are spending Time in the game and getting rewarded, rather than filling a golden achivement and waiting for the next week

Having the powerful grind also be in a range of 100 levels guarantees that it will still require upwards to 20 ish hours to level up a charecter... Note that this 100 power increase would only be aplued to Major expansion, seasons can very well maintain the +10 each season pinnacle grind

The way that the loot range of drops is set up allows players to play underleveld activities for higher power increases per Drop (the harder activity the better). 

Also using ordeal as a baseline, allows Bungie to create different levels of activities to reward different ranges of loot due to power gaps...

Example:

1310 hero level ordeal:
• Drops loot up to 1320 level

The next level of ordeal, Legend, would be set at the power level 1350 (power cap)... Most players leaving the Hero level ordeal will be at 1320 power level

This means there is a Big cap in level there...

This can be filled up by other PvE activities added in an expantion, or even the Expansion relative Seasonal activity, or even a Blind well type activity... Either that or by increasing artifacts powerlevel for an easier time at underleveled activities

This is the core of the system, a Non restricitive constant grind that asks for time commitment, rather than weekly chores

DestinyTheGame,Guardian Game game modes improvement and or ideas for a game mode,"Hello I’m here today to discuss potential ways of making Guardian Games a lot more fun like bringing back game modes like sparrow racing or RIFT because that would make the game event EVEN better then it was before because let’s be honest (guardian games last year was boring af) but if you had event based game modes for it people would love it even more, I think the strike where you can only get paired with certain guardians is a good step in the right direction but game modes would make the event far far FAR Bette, Imo or come up with a new one I actually have an idea for a game mode where you can fight against other guardians it’s in an arena where it splits three ways one Titan one Warlock one Hunter and it introduces each team in threes (similar to trials) you have to kill the other teams to gain points and then an orb randomly spawns in and  you have to grab the orb somewhere on the map and try to protect the person holding it but when they get enough energy they have to deposit it into the middle of a map where then the team with the energy deposited has there supers for a very short time to attack and fight back which also gives the team a few extra points for depositing anyways what do you guys think?

DestinyTheGame,A new player's perspective (Started playing Jan. 25),"Good:

________________________

 - As an artist, first of all, i'd like to say Destiny 2 is probably the most visually beautiful game i've ever played, and is my favorite thing about the game in general. Dreaming City definitely stands out as my favorite location, and i'm usually roaming around there when i have nothing else to do. I've spent many hours literally just *looking* at the game instead of playing it

- Exploration in this game for the first ~3 weeks is pretty mesmerizing, it's around that time when you don't know what to google to find everything out so you actually have to physically go places to find out, and even after that, after you found light.gg and raidsecrets and the wikis and you think you've pretty much discovered everything, you STILL find new things and new ways to play

- Loot in this game is great, I come from a wildly different loot-based flash game from 2010 called Realm of the mad god, and that game is pretty notorious for having an amazing feeling when you get some super rare item. Destiny 2 has even more than that, exotics and legendaries can both be just as exciting to get, even far into the endgame, it took me like 2 weeks to even find out about ritual weapons, playlist weapons, dreaming city weapons, etc. Finishing a build and testing it out is one of the most satisfying things this game can offer

- Free game. Lot of people on reddit and twitter like to say d2 is now a ""free trial"" after BL removed all those old locations and questlines, but i couldn't disagree more. As a player who never plans on spending money on this game, this is absolutely a full game. The only thing i'm missing out on is the bottom row of the season pass, some nice exotics and legendaries, some quests, most of all though, raids. Everything else is completely free. 

- Story is cool.

- Sense of companionship in all PVE content is great, synergy between not only my items but all my team's items and class works so well that you REALLY notice when you're solo. Raids are probably an even better example of this, but i haven't experienced that and don't plan on it until VoG

- Items, especially exotics, can have so much personality behind them at times. Whether it's just a rare item that you were lucky enough to get, or some quest reward that has an entire story behind it, some items you just feel a lot of weight behind when you finally get them in your inventory

- Replayability is pretty much infinite in this game, as it's a grinding loot-based game. Even if you've hit the very top echelon of your builds on all 3 characters, completed everything you can complete (which still i haven't even yet), you can always either start over on a new path, or continue grinding for the littlest optimizations, which isn't unsatisfying in this gam e to me at all

- Sense of scale. This is probably another thing that was even better pre-BL, but this game feels absolutely massive, driving through all the different worlds, taking on armies, fighting gods, etc. The Prophecy dungeon is the greatest example of this, my first run of it was absolutely insane, it's like dropping into the entire fourth dimension with nothing but 3 little weapons and a sparrow


________________________

Bad:

________________________

- Fanbase is distinctly worse than any other ""bad fanbase"" i've seen or been in, probably due to how old the two games are. Games with mostly ""veteran"" fanbases are usually absolutely terrible, it's always either endless defense of the creators (if some of these people could get paid to say ""stop complaining"", they'd be worth more than Bungie itself) or toxicity towards new players, infighting, just general meathead brain

- Terrible gameplay decisions across the board, unbearably obvious p2w marketing in PVP (""oops we made stasis extremely powerful in PVP and near un-counterable! the only counter is paying $40 to get it yourself""). Balancing in PVE is pretty good generally, but every once in a while you'll read the latest patch notes and find out a part of your build has been either deleted or reduced by 100,000 damage and lasts for 0.01 seconds instead of the previous 4 seconds


- Inconsistency and bugs is a problem with this game like i've never seen before with any other game. With a game of this scale, there are *so many* random bugs and inconsistent mechanics that you can have something go wrong, look up the issue, and find a 2-year-old thread talking about it 90% of the time. This can also be a good thing sometimes, as it adds some spice (cheeses, 12 man activities, OOBs are super fun to hunt, etc) but other than that it's almost unbearable

- Physics in this game (movement, velocity, fall/impact damage, character and enemy animations) are pretty horrible and inconsistent sometimes. Getting around by foot and by sparrow can be *extremely* annoying sometimes. You're going to die many times from stubbing your toe, falling one meter, getting sent into the fourth dimension by a Phalanx shield bash, etc. The AI being barebones combined with the fact that some enemy factions have animations that completely cover their crit spot makes for some really annoying gameplay. Don't get me started about Vex crit spots specifically

Staying alive is the best thing so why keep this mod from everyone who doesnt have it? I dont care if it cost 5 Ascended Shards at Banshee's but the last time he sold the mod was 3 months ago... A whole season ago?! Like Bungo you just killed Sunseting you have returning players make these mods accessible to the people who have done the grind for light level prepared the gear maxed out the stats by farming the armor for weeks to get those high stats. Farmed the Ascended shards to max out multiple armor pieces for the GM only to tell them sorry you wernt logged in on this specific day 3 months ago...

[https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/524856635](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/524856635)

Takes a little practice to get the jumps, warlocks and titans should have no troubles.

Use the slopes of the rocks to throw yourself upwards with momentum.

100 Mobility with Stomp335

No sword ammo and no  stasis grenades, which would obviously make that high jump MUCH easier, so this is probably the hardest way to do this section. Defs use these to get you through, only 2 hard-ish jumps and youre free to get through the whole section.

I don't want to make destiny my day job, night shift and Sunday school in order to unlock one catalyst that will improve a weapon which i have already spent a lot of time farming materials to get. What's worse is that the season pass catalyst boost doesnt work for previous seasons' weapons.

Either make the season pass catalyst boost work with previous weapons or reduce the amount in general, because I don't want to spend 8-10 mintues per crucible game 300 times to unlock this.

DestinyTheGame,1325 Power Level for GMs ISN'T Gatekeeping!,"Seen a lot of very upset folks on Twitter who want to be able to run GMs but arent at the 1325 power gate yet. Just a few thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

* Just like at the start of BL, a lot of people knew that GMs would drop 16th March and started levelling in order to be at max power by this point. They raided 3+ times per week across three toons. They minmaxed power and pinnacle drops to maxmise their chances of success. They completed every weekly challenge, even if the thought of playing comp makes their piss boil. It's a grind that needed to start at the beginning of the season, and if you didn't do it, that's fine, just understand that some people did and GMs at 1325 power are for *those* people right now.
* Use the time between now and hitting 1325 to find a reliable fireteam. You'll need one. Run Master Nightfalls. Run them some more, using different toons. Learn callouts, practice your comms and being able to focus fire on the Champions.
* Get ready to dedicate a few nights - when you hit 1325 - to getting it done the first time. Work out what your best team loadout is, and believe.
* Remember that being able to COMPLETE the GM is not about your light level. GMs are HARD. Luck is involved, and even the best people wipe because Fallen Snipers are greasy little shits.
* GMs are the Trials of PvE. They are PINNACLE activities. I don't mess with Trials because I am not good enough and I dont have a team. Take the same attitude to GMs.
* The season is long. You'll get there.

This isnt meant to be a negative post; completing my first ever GM (at the end of last season) was one of my most memorable D2 experiences. I had a regular firetime, we practiced, we got there in the end.

DestinyTheGame,Gambit is not getting the attention it needs from Bungie.,"Les maps then pre-Beyond light, barely any changes to keep the mode fresh and rewarding. 

It gets a little bit of attention because there’s a small minority that enjoy it and a massive chunk that just get it over with for the pinnacle drop. 

It would not hurt the game that much if it just ceased to exist next week. 

 Bungie just do something to it next season. Here’s a few suggestions to make it even slightly better:

1. Add a freelance gambit option 

2. Add new maps and weapons/armor that have gambit specific adept perks 

3. Add a mechanic so that teams need to bank motes into the portal to activate it instead of the bank. That way invading becomes more tactical then just a mechanic to help snowball. 

4. Move the drifter to the main floor of the Tower (seriously he doesn’t need to be way down in the Annex) 

5. Lower the number of points for an infamy rank up.

DestinyTheGame,Earning combat style mods,"with how bungie has set up the current mod system, it is extremely difficult to unlock mods from seasons past.

bungie talked a lot about FoMO, and yet they have put an extremely tight filter on the flow of mods. making people have to wait upwards of a third of a year for a chance at a mod they missed (162 mods that banshee sells)

case an point, i saw a post a couple days ago talking about how since they couldn't get on D2 for ONE day they missed out on an awesome mod (wraith of Rasputin), 

and now unless bungie does some magic in the servers they will have to wait about 100 days on the low end for that mod to be purchasable again

Now im not saying bungie should just give people the mods, no im wanting a more streamline method to earn mods that people dont already have

^((i know they say ""earn rank up packages with the gunsmith"", however after about 4,000 weapon materials (did a vault clean), and i didnt get a SINGLE mod. if theres a chance it aint high enough))

what i believe would be a good alt method other then waiting for the one day the mod is sold to unlock it. add them to rewards pools of higher end activites;

with the difficulty increasing the chance 1 will drop,

these drops would be completely independent to the other loot pools/tables/chances,

and these drops would ALWAYS be for a mod your missing

DestinyTheGame,Primeval health,"Hi, I’m a player who has been here for a relatively long time, and tonight while I was trying to grind for a bottom dollar I realized just how easy the primeval is to kill in gambit.

I feel like gambit is at an okay state right now, not as long as it was when it first launched but not too short, but I feel gambits worst problem is the primeval phase. In gambit you spend all of your time getting motes while also trying to drain and invade to stop the other team from getting motes, and then once you get enough to defeat a primeval. The main issue I have with the primeval is that it gets immediately melted with just 2x primeval slayer, and I feel like gambit would benefit if it went back to the original 75 motes for the primeval and made it so that the primeval fight would last longer.

DestinyTheGame,The state of Bows in PVP &amp; Ticcu's Divination,"We all got excited watching the new season trailer come out. OMG, tracking arrows!! And then everyone had to get PVP Kills with it. That where things got a little sour. It left a bad taste in some peoples mouths. Well, Ticcus Divination can be an unwieldy fellow. The tracking is on point, and can even give you an edge when tracking a target especially around a corner (neat concept). HOWEVER, I find it painfully difficult to land precision shots with this bow. Most bow users need to lead off their shots a bit, since bows ""take some time"" to reach their target. (Higher draw time = faster arrow) But with the new exotic bow, Tracking a target at 20-40 meters gets quite difficult i.m.o. and although the ""opportunity"" occasionally presents itself when a team of guardians hold hands, and you light the group up, it just just doesn't seem consistent. 
    *A bit of a side note :  I have noticed over the past few seasons, Bungie has slowly been lowering stats on our favorite archetypes of weapons. Enough that we don't notice a whole lot until we get further down the line. Aim assist was the first thing I noticed. Each following weapon introduced in a new season has had a bit lower aim assist than its predecessor, but in turn has had larger perk pools. This also plays into the potential kill chaining ability of certain archetypes. Bungie is limiting chained kills to 3 targets so things don't get out of hand (I'm looking at you SunShot). Trinity Ghoul caps around 3 targets per light rod shot (occasionally a 4th).  Okay...back to the good stuff...Bows!*

**I know most people dislike bows, and trust me, I get it. You get frustrated when you use them or when other people use them against you. Getting nailed by Le Monarque through out a game is annoying. Trying to use a bow and not racking up your normal numbers sucks! Whiffing an arrow...well, might as well turn around and hide or you die.**

Either way, this season we got 2 lightweight bows added into the mix. And I was super stoked to try out an Imperial Needle with Impulse Amplifier and Swashbuckler. Needless to say, it felt underwhelming. Same goes with Ticcus Divination.

I have been using bows since the start of my Destiny 2 relationship. Its been a love/hate relationship, but I've learned the ins and outs of where they shine and were they don't. I have about 12k bow kills in the crucible (and I bow swap to hand cannons mostly), so I think I've got the hang of it by now. Being a PVP main, I try to give a loadout a solid try before shelving a weapon for good. I love Bows, regardless of how much they get shit on. It feels good to shit on others using a ""shitty"" weapon.

I know I can trust most all of you put your hands on a bow this season, I saw all the whiny posts about gating the catalyst behind PVP kills. It seems underwhelming, it is a ""sort of"" a high risk/high reward weapon. Multiple hip fire shots suck. Trinity Ghouls hip fire shots do more damage...So what do you all feel? Did Bungie hit its mark in introducing this new exotic bow?

I feel like somethings got to change with Bows. Another exotic that pairs with bow play style. An intrinsic/synergistic pairing like Sturm/Drang. I feel like Hush was a step in the right direction. It rewarded an up close and personal play style with Archers Gambit. Bows are by far the most underrepresented weapon type in the game.",1615961750,2021-03-17 02:15:50

I know Year One catered TOO much to casuals, but now we are going entirely the opposite direction with some content.","If I want a Catalyst for Dead Man's Tale I need to find two players and bust my ass off trying to finish Glykon in a tiny amount of time. Not too hard, it's fine.

If I want to raid I need to go to an out of game LFG, find a team that fits me, then go thrugh one of three raids, all of which are honestly kinda hard for the average player (at least if you don't use cheese for Last Wish.) It's fine though, you could use that glitch in DSC to get a mere 10 tokens a week and pick up the scraps from other gone raids. Oh no wait *you can't*, because Bungie fixed that rather then the sparrow speed bug or something important.

If you want to get the big amount of Bright Dust from the challenges this season, I SURE HOPE YOU LIKIE TRIALS OF OSIRIS, AKA the sweatiest PvP game mode in Destiny. You need to get all but two challenges for the big Dust, so you WILL need to do this and find two more people on out of game LFG. But hey, maybe you can get one of those sweet Adapt weapons right? Sure, if you SWEAT YOUR ARSE OFF, GET HELLA LUCKY, AND GET FLAWLESS.  


Make a post on Reddit about how while Year 1 catered too much to the Casual, the game is leaning TOO much to the hardcore now? Not only will Bungie totaly ignore it, but it will be killed by downvotes immediatly before it's even seen, because god forbid that we make a game even slightly more accessable! You are just whinging because you want easy good loot!   


**No, no I'm really not.** *I don't give a single FUCK about Anarchy (My raiding freind uses it better anyway) or geting a god rolled Adapt Shadow Price when my Warmind Auto Rifle does just fine.* Even if it looks like it with my words, the issue is that both the game, the community, and the developers are going all in on the hardcore direction. Raids are gatekept by LFG. Trails you NEED to find two other people who are godly at PvP. You HAVE to go into the hardest version of Glykon forthe Catalyst to complete the gun. And if you mention any of these as issues, the cumminity will handily disagree.  


**I have a friend now who is perfectly willing to help me with** ***ALL*** **of this shit. I can probably DO all of this, or most of this, with a little bit of sweat. But as a casual player of Destiny, I've never felt more alone, isolated or marginalized.**",1615959702,2021-03-17 01:41:42

Then there's the times were your 3 other teammates leave you to kill all the ads by yourself usually resulting in your death and losing your motes they're usually just dicking off doing god knows what.

The fact that you can’t re-stun them quick enough, and if you miss your timing by just a hair, their health is almost fully regenerated within a fraction of a second. 

That is, until I decided to try Le Monarque on Bunker E15 today, and learned a fun new fact: the poison DoT from Monarque reapplies the stun effect. This bow DESTROYS Overload Champions during void burn (like today) and I imagine it’s probably pretty good even without.

Near the end, Shaw does an interesting move with his Light: 

""Shaw spots several Gladiator detachments redirecting to confront them. He pushes the bulk of his Light into his weapon, spreads its influence to reach the nearby Redjacks, and reignites his gun before touching the barrel to the ground and firing. The ground bubbles with hot magmatic Light; a warmth envelops the Redjacks as Solar flame imbues and empowers their rifles with golden power. Shaw directs the firestorm of golden Redjack rifles to incinerate every last charging foe.""

I want to feel like I died fair and square in pvp and being frozen from around the corner ain't it chief. There's currently no way (to my knowledge) to counter or out-play a stasis engagement and I want to suggest a fairly simple fix.

Imagine a world: while frozen there was a quicktime event where you'd push a random key or button to break stasis instantly instead of mashing the same key/button. In my head this would lead to some out-play potential for the receiving end, we need to be able to break stasis quickly and feel rewarded for it. In the current state of stasis I'm not even sure why bugie gives you the option to break free, you simply get frozen and die, I don't think I've ever gotten the chance to break stasis and actually survive the encounter.

Come on Bungie, be better! Like it's greedy enough that you are trying to make me buy dlcs twice! But whatever, I would accept that and just play the free content on pc. But at least test this shit!

DestinyTheGame,"At this point, can Banshee just sell multiple mods a day at the very least?","Just look how hyped people have gotten over Banshee selling three of the better Warmind cell mods over the last few days.  Hoping that he sells the one mod you don't have (since there's no other way to get them) and having to wait *months* is just terrible.  For instance, Stacks on Stacks was sold three times last year.  June 13, October 29 and November 26.  That was 138 days between the first and second times and a lightning quick 28 for the second and third.  And currently, 111 days and counting since he's sold it last.

Having so many mods and him being the only source of getting old mods is just an awful system.  He should, at the *very* least, have a second page where he sells 5 different mods a day.

DestinyTheGame,Warlocks being mangled,"Warlocks being mangled.

I’m a concerned Warlock. No class in the game has had a subclass deleted but Warlocks(Sunsinger).

We get a new subclass Nova Warp and it gets mangled and forgotten about, it was left with the handheld supernova, that was shutdown along with the gauntlets. 

We get a new stasis super and it was a bit op in the beginning and it got mangled. Penumbral blast was like two feet and done, the super didn’t track anymore and it lost a lot of damage. You do nothing to bosses with that and only the abilities work well in crucible.

We have top tree Arc, the melee chain that got killed but Titans have boots that do pretty much the same thing 🤷🏾‍♂️ it’s not dead or weakened. 

Now the only thing we had was Chaos Reach and now it’s going away. Why do you guys love killing off the Warlocks? Let us live a little. I guess all we can be is middle tree solar for support with lunafaction boots. I know people will speak of top tree solar but yeah take it into pve and see how that works for you.

DestinyTheGame,Can something finally be done with the pvp weapon balancing and ammo economy?,"If you don't play HC + sniper or HC + shotgun, you simply are at a huge disadvantage. It's really bad how we have so many weapon times and archetypes yet if you look at the top 15 most used legendary weapons in competitive PVP, you get :

* 7 HCs (5 are 120 RPM)
* 3 sniper rifles
* 3 shotguns
* 1 pulse rifle
* 1 auto rifle

And if you do consider exotics, in the top 15 most used weapons, 8 are HCs. Of those 8 HCs, 6 are 120 RPM. What sort of weapon diversity is this?!

Bows (beside certain exotics) are extremely bad and too vulnerable to flinch. Same thing for the majority of scout rifles beside DMT (low zoom = less affected by flinch and same/faster TTK as 120 RPM HCs). Autorifles, for the most part, are a joke and require too many shots to kill and constant fire so you can't peak-&gt;shoot-&gt;peak-&gt;shoot... which is a huge detriment. SMGs are essentially worse autorifles and are outclassed by slug shotguns which are outclassed by using buckshot shotguns while sliding toward your target. Pulse rifles have bad TTK (beside the 540 RPM achetype) and, for the most part, the same drop off as 140 RPM HCs so there's no reason to use them over HCs. 

Finally, remove scavenger perk effects in PVP. People are able to cruch too much on their special weapon and barely ever use their primaries (that's one of many reasons felwinter is #1 most used weapon and Astral Horizon is 4th most used weapon).",1615953665,2021-03-17 00:01:05

DestinyTheGame,Break down of elemental wells,"*all testing was done within the haunted lost sector Terminus East, on the EDZ, this was so i had a constant stream of enermies as well as various ranks, since the tribute hall disappeared*

first, they do not work in any measure for pvp, as the mods say combatants. And after testing within PvP there is no ifs or buts / work arounds that i found

now on to the fun stuff

# Basic mod function

every mods comes with this

&gt;Picking up an elemental well grants energy to your ability with the  lowest current energy. Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass damage type grants energy to ALL of your abilities

**Translation :** 

you'll see an discoloured orb of power on the floor pick it up and receive ability energy back.

~~pick up glowy orb on ground, get ability energy for your least charged ability~~

~~if glowy orb matches your glowy powers, get ability energy for all abilities~~

**Specfics :** 

from my testing you get a flat 10% of ability energy PER well with no cool down on this effect

this is the same with the matching vs unmatched with subclass just you get 10% to 1 ability vs 3,

this wells last 20sec from time of summoning, descent but i have wasted many a well because they can be lost in a sea of bodies

**Notes :**

* unlike the warmind cells there is NO way to generate wells without a mod that says it can
   * warmind cells say that ikelos and seventh serif weapons will summon a cell
* multiple mods have no effect

# Elemental Armaments

&gt;Weapons Take downs with a damage type that matches your subclass element have an escalating chance to spawn an elemental well

Translation : kills with a gun that matches your sub class will spawn a well,..... eventually

**Specifics**

this is a flat x amount of kills to spawn a well like with warmind cells, the perk description is VERY vague and misleading in this regard

with testing there is no difference between heavy, special, or primary weapons. they all take 7 kills to proc

further testing showed no difference in ranks, 1 kill is 1 kill

EDIT : forgot mod stacking doesnt work, 1 mod or 5 it still takes 7 kills

**Notes :**

* multi kills count fully, even risky and trinity's arc chains count
* Weapon Types dont matter Rocket launchers through side arms all the same 7 kills
* didnt test cursed thrall of explody shanks

# FONT OF MIGHT

&gt;Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass grants a temporary bonus to weapon damage of that same elemental type

**Translation** : if the elemental well is the same as your subclass any weapons that also match gain a temporary damage bonus

**Specfics** :

this is a FLAT 10% damage buff regardless of the weapon or enemy

this buff last for 5 sec and is capped at 5 sec, regardless

**Notes ;**

* stacking mods doesn't work 1 or 5 mods it's still 10%
* stacks with Debuffs
* as im a solo player with somewhat limited time i didn't have time to test this with buffs

# Elemental Light

&gt;Defeating a combatant with your Super spawns an elemental well that matchs your subclass energy type

**Translation :** super kills generate elemental wells

**Specifics :**

i dont know HOW this works but i believe there is a cooldown on the well spawning, 

* fist of havoc seemed to spawn a well every light attack but slamming seemed be capped at 1 well
* thunder crash spawned one well initially but as i lead red bars into the after shock more spawned

but any way this is simple kills in super generate a well that matchs your sub class

Notes :

* again mod stacking is useless

# Font Of WISDOM

&gt;Picking up an elemental well that matches your subclass energy type grants you an temporary significant increase in your intellect, improving the recharge rate of your super.

**Translation** : Subclass matching wells grants increased intellect.

**Specifics :**

this lasts 30seconds,

this is HARD capped at that 30seconds, regardless of how many you pick up you just reset the timer

**Notes IMPORTANT:**

* i was unable to test the increase granted as the only way i choudl think to test this would be have a teammate generate wells for you
   * this is because kills will decrease your super regen time
   * if anyone has this data i would love to see it.
   * if anyone knows a way i could test this solo i would really want to know
* due to being unable to get solid numbers i dont know if mod stacking applies
* i apologise for all the missing info

# Elemental Ordnance

&gt;Defeating a Combatant with a grenade spawns an elemental well that matches your subclass energy type

**Translation :** grenade kills spawn a well.

**Specific's :**

nothing note worthy 

apart from there seems to be a cooldown between summons, 

grenade kills = elemental well

Notes : 

* no mod stacking
* grenades all share the same cooldown
   * so no top tree striker or Sunbracers spam
* i wonder if grenades and super share that cooldown

&amp;#x200B;

Last But not least

# Elemental Charge

&gt;Become Charged with light by picking up an elemental well. if the elemental well's element type matches your subclass you gain 2 stacks of charged with light

no translation needed this is exactly as it says.

**Specifics :**

this is very clear cut, just remember you NEED something equiped that can burn a charge with light to pick up a charge

i made that mistake, and yeah thought it was busted turns out im an idiot

**Notes ;** 

* should have put this at the start no mods stack as far as my testing has shown

# thoughts

***TLDR :*** *these mods arnt the best there a GREAT introduction into the combat style mod system and are FAR easier to obtain then the other combat style mods however they have glaring issues such as a lack of PvP function as well as being rather weak*

these are nice especially for players wanting to ability spam, in PvE

my biggest issue is the push for aggressive play as the wells spawn where the enemy dies limiting use in high end content.

BUT they feel limp there a great beginners guide to combat style mods but anything they do a charged with light or warmind cell can do and generally better

# as for PVP

i have NO idea why they arnt allowed, why didnt bungie make them spawn/work for PvP

**Stasis**

a non issue, its VERY difficult to spawn these with stasis so especially with no competitive stasis weapons, and all grenade kills hard as hell

* shatter doesn't count and using supers and sometimes be buggy due to how shatter damage and super damage aren't tied together, 
* titans have the greatest ease of summon, but it knee caps the HELL out of the super

Damage Buff

its 10%, and elemental dependant, making it VERY selective in usage

**Charged with light**

maybe, but apart from you know disabling that one mod, if it was broken

it also requires you to spec into summoning these wells, that means at least 2 well mods, and then 1 charged with light, thats at MINIMUM. 

i would recommend armaments and ordinance with charged, then sprinkle in high energy fire. **(if they worked)**

the issue is thats 4 mods and the energy required for them lost, let alone the missing powerful friends or Radiant light

&amp;#x200B;

I hope bungie keeps expanding these mods.

if you have any info you want to add please DM me or comment it.

DestinyTheGame,Let Armor drops increase by +5 each year of Destiny,"With Sunsetting now gone, there is no true incentive once people find their best sets of armor, and realistically, you aren’t playing an MMORPG if the endgame isn’t just completely nitpicking in specific aspects of loot like weapons and armor. Destiny now let us have our (new) loot for an infinitude periods of time but it’s loot structure will eventually plateau. As a player, what incentive do I have to look for other armor in the game if all the armor slots are either not compatible with what I want in my build or is just flat out worse than what I already have? I stated that gear would eventually just plateau, eventually it’ll come to the point where everything is at its most potent which means I will have a total of total 433* (I don’t know if this allows a 400 total stat roll yet that probably requires optimization of builds) maximum potential stat points (season of the chosen)

(67 x 3 + 72 (exotic) + 50 (mods) + 20 strength + 20 mobility (Radiant Light and Powerful Friends) (also can add statsis fragments or mods in future content updates) + 12 x 5 for masterworked armor)

Armor stats are not allowed to be placed onto specific categories unfortunately so we’ll all succumb to the eventually grasp of RNGesus which hiss behind any sort of random generation of numbers but an eventual addition of +5 to a stat will allow the player who has the potential 433 stat rolled armor to look for more pieces of armor and even then, with the heavily optimized armor, the player doesn’t have to switch to the newer gear! They’re allowed to stick with the old gear since there is next to no downsides to switching out the old with the new and vice versa, and especially with transmog, armor pieces are no longer limited by their appearance.

TLDR: Adding a +5 to all armor pieces can add new variety and a reason for veteran players who already have maxed stats to care about armor again.",1615951820,2021-03-16 23:30:20

DestinyTheGame,"While Destiny may have it’s issues, one thing that’s very admirable is the quality of exotic hand cannons.","Ace of Spades - Kill. Reload. Count 6 shots. Reload. Repeat. 6 shots that never fail… Momento mori, my friend. 

Hawkmoon - A transformative weapon that you can hear the power of the Light through with every shot.

The Last Word - An old, reliable piece of iron that will never fail so long as you hit your shots, and learn to adapt to it’s unique shooting style. 

Thorn - A weapon as Dark as the souls of those struck by it. With every shot, you can watch as it devours your enemies and their very essences. 

Sunshot - A weapon as powerful as fire itself. Burning bright, always, and incinerating all in it’s path. 

Lumina - An old hand cannon reforged, from Sorrow into Hope. Instead of the power to drain the Light, it restores it. 

I really admire the quality of exotic hand cannons. While some, like The Last word (overshadowed by DMT) or Sunshot (overshadowed by Trinity Ghoul), may not be viable over other things, the quality of the guns and every shot I take with them always seems to amaze me. Bungie obviously put a lot of effort into them. Like look at the giant Wild West story of the Last Word vs Thorn!

Most of the comments arguing for the nerf was because it was an unintended bug that was game breaking but the fact of the matter is the exact same infinite invis can still be achieved using travelers chosen. Not only that but I'd argue this combo is even more powerful than rat king because it not only returns melee energy but also grenade and dodge energy. I understand the support mindset Bungie had when they made this exotic but removing its synergy with rat king seems pointless if you can achieve an even more powerful synergy with another exotic still in the game. The reason I liked using rat king was the dark shadows theme it brought to the subclass. I'll miss you rat king, travelers chosen is the play now.",1615949710,2021-03-16 22:55:10

DestinyTheGame,In depth breakdown of light supers and what needs adjustments,"I was going to not post anything about any light subclasses tuning because I figured Bungie had their hands full with making stasis somewhat balanced in PvP, but since they decided chaos reach needed to be tweaked I guess asking for other subclasses to be looked at is fair game.

I only play as one character so I can't speak for titans or hunters but I know some of their light subclasses are severely underpowered against stasis (middle tree sentinel can't block stasis) or just in general so I invite them to post in the comments the things that need to be changed about theirs.

As for myself, I've been using nova warp almost exclusively since season of the chosen began, long before warlocks had their week of rebelling by using it (where did all of our motivation go after like 4 days guys? come on, this is why we suck at guardian games). I think I have a pretty good grasp of the shortcomings on the subclass as well as its strengths.

Neutral game: warlocks have a pretty generic middle game excluding top tree dawn, but nova warp has an interesting kit nonetheless.

* Hand held super nova: What was once one of the most broken abilities in crucible is now at best a shitty fusion rifle. There was an incorrect patch note that self damage was reduced to 25%, I can assure you that's not the case in PvP. Its charge time is excessive, its range is mediocre, and the low hold time means your timing has to be near perfect.  
Buff: lower charge time OR longer hold time, giving it both could make it overpowered
* Melee: Honestly a pretty good melee, it works sometimes to push away the other person out of melee range and they just swing at nothing, other times they lunge their melee into you and you die, meh  
Buff: Nothing, pretty balanced
* Dark matter: Honestly a slept on part of the tree. Kills with any of your abilities help recharge your other abilities and return health. This often will make it so you can take more than 1 shot from a handcannon after getting a kill with an ability and maybe get to cover.
* Nova Warp: Oh boy, this super has become a verb at this point. ""they're going to nova warp that super"". Translation: It's strong, and bungie's decision for nerfs is to take every part of what makes it good, and nerf each one of them individually.  
**Charge time**: there is no other roaming super in the game that requires you to charge.  
**Reduced movement speed while charging**: too much, I understand why this is necessary but the current movement speed while charging is like crouch walking  
**Dark Blink**: I've had situations where its cost me half my super to get to someone, the cost to blink is marginally too high, a minor reduction in super cost would go a long way  
**Explosion/Damage**: This will forever be a lopsided fight, it shouldn't be able to one shot other roaming supers yet it will never be able to get two explosions off before the other super can shut it down. That being said the range of the explosion could maybe be increased by a minor amount to allow the novawarp a chance to take them on  
**Miscellaneous**: I know comparing this super to behemoth titans isn't really a fair comparison but look at it like this, behemoth light attacks are more lethal than nova warp heavy attacks and actually offer mobility. I have fought countless behemoths in my super actually intentionally doing it at some points to see if there was some weakness novawarp could find. Spoiler: There is not. the light attack of the behemoth can actually allow the titan to escape the explosion of the novawarp. If the heavy attack connects, its over, if the light attacks connects, its over, if the light attack misses, the titan gets out of the damage area.  


Summary  
HHSN: needs the self damage reduction to actually work in PvP  
needs either a decrease to the charge time OR an increase to hold time  
Super: Of the following, 1-2 = still a meh super, 3 = a relatively balanced super, 4 = a top tier super  
Charge time of blast decreased  
Movement while charging is increased to not move at a snails pace  
Explosion range or damage is increased  
Dark blink cost reduced  
Dark Matter health regen is greater while in super?   


Once again I invite other classes to post theirs in the comments, I anticipate many of the comments will be unfriendly, and to those people I simply say, I hope your favorite subclass receives the nova warp treatment",1615948681,2021-03-16 22:38:01

DestinyTheGame,Pinnacle drops in this game are broken.,"3 weeks ago, when i learned that GM nightfalls would be able to be farmed for adept weapons (i was out of the loop) i started seriously grinding pinnacles to reach 1310. That same week, i had 7...i repeat, 7 pinnacles in the same 2 spots. The only pinnacles that actually increased my light were the first 2 that dropped in their respective slots. I got a total of 4 chest pieces, and 3 legs, and only the first in each of those slots increased my overall light. The next week was nearly as bad, but with head pieces and kinetic weapons, with a total of 5 repeating pinnacles. Today, when i was excited for reset to maybe, finally reach 1310, i started pinnacle farming, and my first two pinnacles were bonds, with the first one dropping as a 1309 and the second dropping as 1308 (my base power is 1307). I logged off and switched to another game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bungie, this is demoralizing. There should be no reason for this amount of drop duplication from pinnacles. I get that you want people to keep playing your game all the time, and have reasons to come back every week, but negating HALF or more of my pinnacle drops does the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what to do about it? Honestly, i don't know. I don't know how difficult that is of an issue to address, or how to balance it so you don't reach pinnacle cap day one of a new season, but i do know that losing half or more of your pinnacles a week due to duplication, just out right breaks my drive to play.",1615947925,2021-03-16 22:25:25

DestinyTheGame,Eyes of Tomorrow and the Descendant Title,"This week makes it 54 looted clears without Eyes of Tomorrow dropping.

It's pretty disheartening that week after week, the rocket launcher won't drop when it's all I, and I assume many others, have left to acquire to complete the Descendant title. 

Titles are suppose to show the effort you've put into an activity, albeit the DSC title isn't too difficult, but at this point, I've been through a much fiercer battle with RNG than Taniks himself.

I know previous titles have had elements of RNG tied to them with collections portion like the Shattered Throne ship and Cursebreaker - but those I don't believe had bad luck protection, so there was reason to be disappointed when they didn't drop.

But it's been confirmed that Eyes of Tomorrow does have a cumulative drop chance, whether its an increase per account or per character every week, we don't know, but protection nonetheless.

At this point I'd rather find out at what point do we get to 100% drop rate then have me hopes up every week that it might drop, it would save me the disappointment.

What will probably be more disappointing is that if they find that the bad luck protection hasn't been working and they fix it, it will no doubt ignore all previous completions and we'll need to build up the drop chances again.",1615947639,2021-03-16 22:20:39

DestinyTheGame,Raid Exotic Ranking list,"I am just going to start off by saying that this is just my opinion, and that you are fine to disagree with me. These may be subject to change with future buffs and nerfs, so feel free to let me know if I should change anything. 

Number 6: Tarrabah. I think this gun has huge potential if it receives any changes (which is probably unlikely at this point). While I find it fun to use and it can do some damage in certain scenarios, there are just far better exotics for practical use.

Number 5: Legend of Acrius. This gun is very good in close quarters scenarios when you need big damage, especially with the catalyst, but there are not that many scenarios that can utilize it. There are much better weapons that can fill the heavy exotic slot.

Number 4: Eyes of Tomorrow. This rocket launcher gets out dps'd by some legendary rocket launchers, and that Is not a good thing. It can clear out rooms of ads and majors great, but why would you waste your heavy for that? With the damage reduction against bosses and many other enemies, I put this at number 4. To be fair, though, it is an amazing invade weapon in gambit. 

Number 3: One Thousand Voices. This was going to be Eyes of Tomorrow, but with all the damage nerfs and bugs going around it, I decided to put 1k at number 3. It is fun as hell, does a lot of damage, and has dps comparable to xenophage. It is an S tier weapon, and it is very fun to use.

Number 2: Divinity. This weapon will most likely always be utilized in endgame content as long as somebody has it. This weapon is almost essential to one phase taniks with slug shotguns, and it can be used in many other situations as well (I love helping blueberries do more damage in strikes). This weapon will most likely always be relevant in endgame content, hence my high ranking.

Number 1: Anarchy. I bet you could all see this coming a mile away. It is probably the most versatile weapon in the entire game. Great boss damage, ad clearing, champion killing, and many other things. If you don't have this weapon, this should be one of, if not your top priority to get. Being able to deal damage from behind cover is huge in endgame content, and being able to switch to your special for higher dps is just icing on the cake. 

Thanks for reading everyone.

DestinyTheGame,BeerThought: How the final mission of the Light And Darkness Saga should go.,"Picture this:
The Darkness has finally made it to Earth. Where the Traveler sits, the lead Pyramid hovering not far. Scale ship and Guardian jumpships flying through the skies, the surrounding orbit of Earth, every planet we have left. Aerial combat the likes of which humanity has never seen before. Meanwhile ground troops fight in a seemingly endless firefight to gain a single step forward on both sides. 

Now we come to you, Guardian, in the midst of the most hardcore ship-to-ship combat experience in your time as a Guardian. Flying through gravitational anomalies while outrunning a swarm of Pyramid Scale ships. Suddenly Ghost cries out that you've lost one of your thrusters and you are now spinning out of control. In an act of reckless desperation, you punch the warp drive activation. 

The next thing you know, you're crashing into solid ground. The gamble worked. You climb out of your ship and look around, and a nauseating wave of nostalgia washes over you as you see rusted cars, a broken highway bridge, and a massive wall. The Cosmodrome. You laugh and check your weapons. Heavy ammo is low, your preferred special is still working, but your Primary weapon is in pieces. Ghost says he's unable to connect to your Vault to get you another optimal weapon. You're already running through the Breach, shooting any Hive or Darkness you come across. Suddenly, your eye catches something. You recognize a symbol used by Hunters to identify a cache they stored away for anyone who finds it. You rush over and rip the cache open. And there it is, you're oldest and fondest friend. Who was there for you at the very Beginning, and now is there for you at the End. Khvostov. Sight is cracked, plenty of ammo, and feels just right in your hands.

Therefore, less casuals play Trials, making it harder for casuals that do want Trials’ loot from getting it. Massive downward spiral in overall playerbase. 

Literally the addition of random postgame rewards, maybe that even increase as you go up the card, would give casuals a reason to play Trials because they are being *rewarded for their time*.  More casuals, the easier it is for casuals to get loot, causing even more casuals to play Trials. Massive upward spiral in overall playerbase. 

I feel like it’s been such a no brainer locked behind the sentiment of “Trials loot is for good players” and the “git gud” mindset associated with Trials, but quite frankly it’s awful that time and resources are going to be allotted to a gamemode that so few play. If there’s an actual playerbase associated with trials, then it would justify development time to be spent on it (ie: general improvements, new loot, etc).

DestinyTheGame,Infinite Depths - An idea for a Hive procedurally generated cavern system.,"*Who knows how many maze like tunnels and caverns exist below the moon. The Hive have burrowed deep below its surface for years and there are probably a near infinite amount of dark, winding passages connecting to larger caverns. Shouldn't Guardians begin to explore these depths?*

This idea takes inspiration from the Underground DLC from the Division which created procedurally generated levels in the subway system of New York. The Hive set the perfect premise for such an activity and would allow for procedurally generated tunnels &amp; cavern systems to be linked together randomly. Destiny does underground settings very well and with enough tile sets in the mix this could feel near endless. Being the Hive it could even have some suspenseful elements like low light areas utilizing our headlamps paired with spooky ambient sounds to create a more intense experience similar to the recent Presage mission (Loved that one!) 

The activity could have custom settings at the start to allow for setting the length &amp; difficulty and perhaps some modifiers to increase the challenge (and chance for loot to drop).

DestinyTheGame,"Tips for Devil's Lair Nightfall strike, all Champion locations for Hero and Legend difficulty, video with timestamps and descriptions","Hello all.  Posting another video of Champion spawns with timestamps for the Hero and/or Legend Nightfalls, plus some tips that I hope will help.

Video link: https://youtu.be/s6cZNBcH8Qw

If I've missed stamping anything please let me know!  
&amp;nbsp;


**Other Tips:**

- **Shields are Arc, Solar, AND Void:** Unfortunately, all shield elements are present in this weeks Nightfall, and they all show up in significant enough numbers or places to be a hassle to deal with when Match Game is active.  A sword might help for Captains' Arc shields, but is Risky against Wizards' Solar and will NOT be able to reach Servitors' Void without a lot of dangerous jumping around in the middle of a boss fight.  Speaking of swords...

- **Swords are mixed in terms of usability:**  It's a tough call on whether swords are the best heavy choice this week.  There are several extremely add-heavy encounters, and at least one is in extremely close quarters, so swords are a great help there.  They can be extremely helpful in killing the two giant Brigs during teh Spider Tank fight, and are also a great fallback option during the boss fight to kill Captains or other adds who move in at you a bit aggressively.  Unfortunately, they're practically entirely unusable against this weeks boss and his shielding Servitors, and are also probably dangerous to attempt to use against the Spider Tank.  If you're solo and feel like you can DPS the strike boss and Spider Tank without them then I'd definitely bring one, but if you aren't sure then opt for something with more range.

- **This week's boss is extremely weak to Machine Guns:**  For some reason, this week's boss doesn't seem to register as being an actual strike boss.  As such, machine guns don't get their normal penalty to damage against bosses, and are capable of dealing great damage.  This is especially useful considering how far away the boss can be at times, as well as the amount of teleporting that he does which might cause you to miss shots with something like a rocket or GL.  Machine guns can also fill the same add clearing/""make my problems go away"" role that swords tend to fill, which is nice considering that this week's boss can't really be hit with swords.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think that's it for now, but if anybody else has anything really important to add I'll also add that to the main post.  Hope this helps!",1615941315,2021-03-16 20:35:15
DestinyTheGame,Osmosis Spec mod idea,"this is just an random idea i had for an Osmosis specific mod

[light.gg, osmosis perk](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1774574192/osmosis/)

Name : Osmosis Spec

Description : Kills whist osmosis is active increases grenade recharge

what it does

* after proc'ing osmosis, any kills by the weapon will grant an increase to discipline
   * duration per kill is based on rank
      * red bar                           = 3sec
      * major/champions        = 4sec
      * bosses and guardians = 5sec
   * max duration is capped at 10 sec
   * buff goes away as SOON as the weapon is stowed regardless of remaining time
      * this is just like the perk you lose the element as soon as it is stowed
   * buff to discipline is ;
      * buffedStat = stat + ((100 - stat) \* 0.5)
      * this is rounded up

with this stasis would need to be added to the osmosis list, which would also allow for stasis to use elemental wells more/better

EDIT : after doing the maths below i feel 50% is to high thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

^(just to show off the maths)

^(10 discipline)

^(= 10 + ((100 - 10) \* 0.5))

^(= 10 + 90 \* 0.5)

^(= 10 + 45)

^(= 55 (rounded up))

^(\~= 60)

^(87 discipline) 

^(= 87 + ((100 - 87) \* 0.5))

^(= 87 + (13 \* 0.5))

^(= 87 + 6.5)

^(= 87 + 7 (rounded up))

^(= 94)

^(\~= 100 (rounded up))",1615941208,2021-03-16 20:33:28

Maybe some new perk or mod slots on our ghost or something.

Rather than having something like the dark decoder to decrypt engram into specific loot drops, why can't we have an artifact or mod that increases our drop changes of a particular weapon or armor piece in any given playlist?

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, please don't go too far separating sandboxes.","I know that most of us have been wanting certain guns and abilities to retain their potency in PvE while not being overpowered in PvP, and I consider myself to be in that crowd. 

However, what appeals to me the most about this game is that I can rely on everything that I have equipped functioning exactly the same in both PvE and PvP.  I know that in the heat of the moment, no matter what activity I'm in, I don't have to think about what activity I'm in and what that means for an ability I'm going to use. 

With the latest round of Stasis adjustments Bungie has done something they've never done before, and that is changing the core function of how an ability performs depending on the activity. Casting Glacial Quake in PvP no longer freezes enemies around you in PvP, but it will in PvE. The Hunter Withering Blade shurikens won't apply enough slow stacks to freeze on double impact or combined with the dodge while in PvP, but they will in PvE. 

Changes like the above are great for players that main PvP and barely touch the rest of the game and vice versa. As for players like myself that enjoy them equally, I don't want to see too many of these core functionality changes.",1615937674,2021-03-16 19:34:34

DestinyTheGame,"""We don't want people to do the same seal every season, so here's gilded"" - you made gilded conqueror the same as base conqueror the past 3 seasons","So the requirements for gilded conqueror are to all 6 GMs this season. In a TWAB when Gilded was announced this was a quote from it:

""We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!"" 

Yet Gilded is the exact same as base conqueror has been the past few seasons? This was pretty disappointing to find out after finishing the new base conqueror today as I thought we'd get fun challenges to do and be able to finally unlock gilded this week.

Kinda sucks how it's the exact same thing again and we can't get gilded for another 5 weeks so we hardly get to enjoy the golden title.

Will this be changed in future seasons so we get to have gilded for more than a few weeks at the end of  the season and get more interesting challenges to tackle? The all subclass one would have been a good one for gilded conqueror imo.",1615936710,2021-03-16 19:18:30
DestinyTheGame,Guided Games could make use of the 12-man raid bug/feature: 6 pre-matched players guiding 6 randoms.,"After seeing another post by a user with similar neurodiversity conditions to me, it sparked an idea on how to revamp the currently, mostly obsolete 'Guided Games' feature. Right now, Guided Games are not really used for a plethora of reasons - from there not really being much reward to doing them to the fact that it's still capped at 6 players, and as most raids require significant coordination, it's hard to help coordinate with randoms who are likely still learning the raid to get objectives complete.  

I think the 12-man Raid bug/feature is ideal for Guided Games. You could allow a group of 6 players with a specified amount of clears in the raid to be the 'guides', which would then match them with 6 randoms or smaller groups (like fireteams of 2-3), who they would guide through the raid. This would help users who aren't as comfortable with LFG, don't have the friends to play the game, or simply conditions which make interacting on this level difficult.  

I understand that there would have to be some incentive for players to actually *be* guides, as well as good reasoning for experienced players to just not jump into GG instead of going on LFG and finding a group. So, here are a few things I thought could incentivize guides and discourage players who can do the raid 'normally' from abusing the GG System:  
**Encouragement for Guides:**  
* Add some kind of drop rate for Upgrade Materials when guiding guardians, chance increases per additional Guardian in the 'guided' group - Upgrade Modules, Cores, Prisms &amp; even Shards for the final boss would be a great incentive for groups of 6 to drop into guide mode instead of just running a raid regularly.  
* Additional XP, emblems, ornaments, &amp; non-powerful loot to encourage people looking for specific rolls to do so with guided games.  

**Discouragement for people abusing system:**  
* Limit loot from GG to 1 time per account per week per activity. This would at least prevent repeated farming on alt characters. While it would have some impact on genuine GG users, it's a necessary feature to prevent people abusing it imho.  
* Prevent from re-queueing into an activity as a guided player if you already have gotten your loot from, or completed a successful run of that activity that week.   

Additionally, the use of the report system and the 'guardian oath' are a good way of keeping the system overall 'clean' of abusive users on either side.  

I think this, along with some kind of ping system to help non-chat communication, would honestly work perfectly to make Guided Games what it should've been.",1615936657,2021-03-16 19:17:37

Not being able to get all the scanners on Europa, or Exo bodies, or Stasis crystals, or these new ones in the Glykkon mission if I want to devote time into it feels awful.

It's especially been awful recently with the release of Beyond Light, where my friends and I played a whole bunch for the first couple weeks but the Seasonal content was just unengaging, so we stopped. Despite the inordinate amount of time we spent after BL dropped, we just weren't allowed to get the collectibles, something we actually had a desire to do, for no real reason. It's disheartening, and the way you're doing it on the Glykkon is even worse.

Joe Blackburn tweeted that there is bad luck protection. He left out how much it goes up each week u do it though. I believe this is the case because the drop chance it goes up each week u do it is tiny and that he knew the community would be mad. 

There has been speculation in the community regarding the exact amount it goes up but there is no known number.

Without an objective there is more freedom to move and engage as you please. You won’t get duskfielded or shatterdived every time you go to cap a zone. Your team won’t get team wiped by a single stasis ability every time you come down the choke point from A to B. If you go off on your own you don’t risk the other team capping all of the zones and running the score up on you for a mercy. I have played for 3 straight hours and haven’t encountered a single mercy. In fact, almost all my games were fairly close games within single digits with more than one coming down to a kill or two at the end.

I thought when a season ends, the exotic quests are available for all the people that didn't buy season of the hunt pass, but no when i did the moon quest with osiris, got to talk to spider no quest was popping. I started to think , maybe i need to research a little more.  
Went to the old quest kiosk, nothing  
Got the osiris message you receive after the quest and returned to spider, nothing  
Then i see some posts saying that you have to purchase a lure from crow and do a wrathborn hunt, i say cool and i proceed to get this lure from crow.

  
When i get there says ""Season of the Hunt pass required"" and prompts me to go buy beyond light deluxe edition to get it. so instead of saying well dude give me 1000 silver ( 334$ARS ) and i let you get the weapon. 

Instead i have to pay 1949$ARS to get the only thing i wanted from beyond light because the only way to get the season of the hunt pass is to get the deluxe edition.

So now i have to wait to next dlc to get the weapon from a kiosk (wich i dont like because i like doing quests).

I watched this video which was pretty good in explanations ( [https://youtu.be/Q\_1TLH\_ZyuQ](https://youtu.be/Q_1TLH_ZyuQ) ) but I still have some questions. I also want to add that I don't have any expansion. 

\- Firstly, is there any story-based quests for returning player to get to the soft cap (is it still 1200?) ? Or any other way that isn't just going left and right killing enemies on a map.

\- From the video it seems that D.I.M is a must have, should I get into it right now?

\- My first character is stuffed exo + purple but of course it is only 1100. I read that exo are still viable but should I throw away the rest of my gear when I drop something new? (except if I want to keep it for transmog)

\- About sunset gear, I read that since it couldn't be infused anymore it was safe to delete all of it but better be safe than sorry so I'm still asking about it here

DestinyTheGame,Dead Man's Tale catalyst quest not showing up on other characters?,"I completed Presage for the first time on my Hunter a few weeks back, then when Master dropped, Zavala gave me the catalyst quest.  Rad.

However, since then, I've been playing more on my Warlock.  I ran regular presage with some friends, got my pinnacle reward and a new roll on DMT, just like you normally would.  What I didn't notice at the time was that I didn't get the catalyst quest on my Warlock.  Then two days ago, I finally got around to running Master Presage.  We completed it with some difficulty, I was excited to get the catalyst to pop, and then... nothing.  I checked my quest inventory and realized I didn't have the quest.  Okay, pretty annoyed that I wasted time suffering through Master only to get nothing out of it, but that's on me for not checking beforehand.  Went back to the tower to talk to Zavala and... he didn't have the quest.  Weird.  Then I realized that I never did the Forsaken campaign on my Warlock, so that map was locked behind the opening mission.  Maybe that's why.  I run the first mission of Forsaken (first few missions actually, just to be sure), the map is open and I can now select Presage from the director.  Zavala still doesn't have the quest for me.  Finally, I run Presage solo.  This should definitely do it.  Nope, still no quest from Zavala.

This has to be a bug, right?  Normally, exotic catalyst quests show up at the vendor as ""abandoned quests"" on your other characters and share progress.  I've been able to pick up where I left off on multiple catalysts after switching characters.  I realize that I can just do Master on my hunter (which is honestly probably for the best since the warlock jump is a fucking nightmare in that mission), but it's annoying that this caused me to miss out on the catalyst from my first Master clear.  Also annoying that Bungie still stubbornly forces you to complete the campaigns on all three characters in order to open up destinations on your alts.  If this is indeed a bug, I'm almost certain that that was the culprit.",1615929881,2021-03-16 17:24:41

DestinyTheGame,"If you're trying to get Xenophage, be aware that the Lost Sector puzzles are currently bugged.","I googled this issue and saw other posts about it, but posters in those threads have chalked it up to explosive or unstoppable rounds.  This is not the issue (it might be a separate issue).  The puzzles are bugged (step 2 of The Journey quest).

When I tried doing these puzzles with my fireteam, shooting the first button changed the symbols, but the second button did nothing.  We kept trying the second button for a while, and eventually it changed (after like 3-4 minutes of waiting).  Same for the third and fourth buttons.  We tried this in K1 Logistics and K1 Communion, same issue in both.  When we finally got the fourth button to change and all the symbols matched up, the chest did not spawn. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/qfm2d5D) We waited for like 10 minutes and the chest never spawned.

We tried leaving and retrying the lost sectors, we tried going to orbit and reloading the instance, we tried splitting up and trying solo, the issue still occurred.  We tried using a scout rifle, a sidearm, and even a shotgun.  It wasn't until my friend tried solo using an SMG that it worked.  Then I tried it with a pulse rifle and it worked.  Auto rifles were not tested, but it definitely seems to be an issue with single-shot weapons (though my scout rifle was the full-auto raid scout).  I don't know whether this is a new issue or an old one that never got fixed.  I had done this step of the quest on my Hunter a while back and had no issues, but I don't remember what weapon I was using at the time.

TL;DR - This part of the quest is bugged with multiple weapon types.  The symbols will glitch and fail to change if you're using the wrong weapon type.  The only weapon types I know to work are SMGs and Pulse Rifles.  So SGA: do this step of the quest with a pulse rifle or SMG equipped.",1615927615,2021-03-16 16:46:55

DestinyTheGame,"Guided Games 2.0 could simply be 6 raiders plus 1-2 ""ride alongs""","The biggest issue with current Guided Games is that a group of 4 people are matched with 2 people who may or may not know the raid, and may or may not even communicate. Raids generally require active participation from all 6 players, and this is where guided games falls apart pretty quickly and why almost nobody uses the feature.

What is the goal of guided games? My understanding is: 1) to introduce raids to players who have never raided before, and 2) familiarize and teach a raid and it's mechanics to novices.

I am willing to bet that the 12 player raids we have seen over the past few weeks have introduced and familiarized more players to raids than guided games ever has.

# What if, instead of guided games being 4 guides and 2 seekers, it was 6 guides and 2 seekers? 

That way, it's less of a big deal if the seekers aren't fully capable or even cooperative. If raid mechanics only require 6 players, they can dip their toes, take a role is they want to, or just clear adds. Regardless, they get to see the raid and have some degree of first hand experience.

A negative thing I could see happening often is that the seekers just make no attempt to engage with the raid mechanics. Maybe they just kill adds and do some DPS. That's still an upside for a team of 6 raiders who were going to do it anyway.

Also what stops the seeker from triggering wipe mechanics? Nothing, but if a seeker goes full griefer mode then they won't get very far before the guides just leave and do it without them. It's still no worse than 4+2 guided games.

Also if we are concerned about seekers getting easy raid rewards, maybe seekers just get weaker rewards than guides? Such as powerful drops instead of pinnacles. Perhaps the guides recieve bonus Spoils of Conquest?

I previously thought that Guided Games was never going to be able to succeed, but I had never considered extra players as a possibility. After seeing the positive impact that 12 man raids has had on brining ""raid virgins"" into raids, it's pretty clear that this is the best solution to Guided Game's problems.

The solution doesn't have to be perfect, by the way. I'm pretty sure hardcore raiders would not have the patience to add a couple extra ""variables"" to their runs. But I can see a lot of weekend warrior type raiding clans willing to rope in a couple randoms in exchange for some extra rewards. And I can see a LOT of raid newbies using a feature like this to test the waters and eventually be able to say they KWTD.",1615926434,2021-03-16 16:27:14

DestinyTheGame,What destiny means to me. by ALI ZIN for SOTR (sorry about the grammar) i’m only 15.,"I’ve played destiny 1 since it came out on xbox. at the time. I was about eight years old. I played with my parents, my father a hunter, my mother a warlock, and me a crayon eating titan. For my 12th birthday, my parents some how got me a solo tour into bungie, and it made me fall in love with the game even more, they were play testing destiny 2 at the time. They showed me the inner workings of bungie, I met cozmo, got a a motherboard of the original halo 2 game (I don’t know how that works). Then I did VOG, it was my only raid completion ever on d1. Sadly, that was the end of my time with d1, I later moved on to d2 and it’s beta. Of course, i was a titan and I loved it. As a fire team (my mom, dad, grandpa, a summer camp counselor, my friend, and I.) We tried to do the leviathan, of course, we failed, at the time, i was young and quite bad at the game. I was able to convince my summer camp counselor and my parents to do a lfg thru destiny. We loaded in, all four of us, with two other dudes who lived across the country in pittsburg. Little did I know they would end up being some of my best friends. We finished the raid, slaying calus and screaming. once the dust and bullet shells settled, my father, finally made a clan called the Shards Of the Traveler. He invited everyone we knew that played, (at the time it was only my grandpa, friends, the dudes we met, and my counselor.) It slowly grew as my  family (fire team fambam) grew closer to the dudes we met and my counselor (fireteam bully). We began to complete raids like it was a thing that noobs do so easily, one in a hour. (which now i know isn’t crazy good). My dad started to get good at crucible, so like father like son, i followed. We got the revoker, recluse, lunas and nf. I played with the same people for three- four years. Almost every day(no i’m not a fat slob, I play a lot of soccer so i’m fit). I grew to know these boys well, and i grew up around them. Over the last year, we were introduced to a new clan mate, a friend of theirs from college, she and my mother immediately connected, both of them being decently bad ( I love you mom). We would play every night from 6 until 9-10pm, we killed gods, guardians, and stasis wielding jerks on europa. I became a hunter, and became really sweaty. I’m now known as the “super sweaty kid” by all of my classmates that play destiny. I’ve grown to be in love with the game, sure stasis sucks, but we can all agree, this game has a vision that if given a chance, can be a truly amazing game. Whether it’s in killing hive gods, becoming flawless in trials, or just doing 12 man nightfalls with clan mates. 

To round this little story up. This game, in a odd way, raised me, from a crayon eating fist slamming titan, to a hunter who at times is reported for using aimbot. (I don’t use it). This is for destiny, my family/my clan; cap, drop pod, skele, ellie, hahn, and zed. I love you all, and for everyone who as sticked with this odd game thru the rough times.

And it did more than just provide fun times, it opened up access to tougher events (Raids specifically I feel) to people that could just never enjoy that.  

My sister in law is casual at best and just not very skilled.  She cannot raid and struggles with tough content.  However I took her through a 9 guardian garden of salvation and she absolutely loved it.

What I would like to propose Bungie do is make this an event.  Just like triple infamy, or double valor.  12  guardian Fireteam weekend.

Any ideas?! I think it'd be good to have one for hoard mode (lots of small enemies around), another for big boss mode (lots of big enemies around, or for a big tough one), and another for... I'm not sure... generating class ability?!

If you masterworked any of them, I recommend not swapping them around so that the materials you spent masterworking aren't essentially thrown away.

DestinyTheGame,I have a theory about the Proving Grounds Strike coming in a week.,"Spoiler cuz of the new lore, and in case I am right (probably unlikely)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so in the new Lore book, it goes over Zavala's decision to challenge to Cabal to a Rite of Proving to put a conclusion to the Battlegrounds. Caiatl says ""We'll put forth Ignovun as our champion... inside the Halphas Electus. We'll see how much Light the smallmen have once they fight their way inside.""

Two things here, I'm pretty sure the Halphas Electus is the big-ass tank on Nessus, but that's literally only because I don't even know what else it could be. We're fighting our way inside eventually, so it makes sense to me. Second, is this; ""**We'll see how much Light the smallmen have** once they fight their way inside.""

&amp;#x200B;

You know how the Cabal have developed Light disrupting tech? What if they took that and put it into a much larger, Cabal scale? Like an intentional trap to secure victory by taking away our Light for the Rite of Proving? What if the boss fight of the Proving Grounds Strike doesn't allow us to use our abilities, at all? Like the Red War?

&amp;#x200B;

After looking over the Season of the Chosen trailer, I never saw an ability used inside the tank at all. This could easily be a coincidence, but I think it's possible that Proving Grounds will strip our light from us once more, making it a little more ""equal"" fight. Of course, this is all speculation, but I don't really see why this couldn't happen. Plus it would make the strike really unique and much more of a challenge, something that is to determine the fate of the Cabal Empire should probably be.",1615924675,2021-03-16 15:57:55

Anyway here's my idea with scaling rewards with fireteams.


 If you're in a fireteam of 3/6 you can unlock all triumphs and pinnacles and loot drops fully masterworked (maybe 7/8 for armour) for your first run maybe a huge chunk of glimmer and upgrade materials. Exotics/cosmetics will also only drop in a fireteam of 3. High chance of high roll amour (80%).

However if you have 3+/6+ you only get base power weapon and armour. No materials no spoils, heck no access to rerolling thing. Low chance of high stat amour (20%)

Contest mode is only for the correct sizes.

I think this strikes the right balance of loot/fun/team sizes.",1615924133,2021-03-16 15:48:53

My next thought was let me get a fun build to use, I go through youtube and look for some builds alot of them seem kinda uninteresting or old but I came across this one titan build with like divinity and powerful friends with the hailing confusion. And I go great i'll use this it looks fun as fuck. But I get deeper into the video and I am missing some of the mods. Specifically Radiant Light and Swift Charge. Ever since I saw that video I go to banshee everyday at reset and pray that he atleast will bring one of them especially swift charge since I love using sidearms,submachine gun, and pulses. the thing that gives me the greatest amount of despair was just the fact that I missed it. It's not a raid gun or something that comes with random rolls so I can't complain about bad rng it was an accessable mod from the gunsmith. There is no quest no nothing all I had to do was just give him 10 mod components. I was originally one of those people who didn't get warmind cells or CWL mods so I just ignored them. Now I'm sitting here biting the bullet. I know I didn't mention a warmind cell mod in this post but they're just so good honestly atleast the last 3 days banshee has sold 3 good ones back to back.",1615922477,2021-03-16 15:21:17

Ever since the silent nerf of reactive pulse, I've changed my build and tried using a war mind cell build with Wrath of Rasputin and Burning cells with Sunshot. And I love it! It's honestly so much fun to use. But, anytime I load into strikes or battlegrounds, my randoms will shoot and destroy them. Now if they have war mind mods equipped then by all means shoot it. But I've inspected the ones who have destroyed them and they have no mods equipped, meaning the cells will not do anything. And it's infuriating. 

Idk maybe there should be a change to them where you can't interact with them without a war mind cell mod on. I've just been really excited to finally try out this build, and I haven't been able to interact with the cells before a fellow random decides to destroy it.

DestinyTheGame,"It's been fun, but I'm out after how the past few months have played out.","Done with and uninstalled Destiny 2. They banned our clan leader right before Christmas with no explanation and zero response from customer support, our clan pretty much all stopped playing out of solidarity with him. Since then we've tried for several months to get any sort of response from Bungie with nothing coming back, and the community as a whole has been *completely unhelpful and incredibly rude*.

For something I spent over a thousand hours and several hundred dollars on, I can't help but feel like I wasted my time giving this game a try, and very much so wasted my time custom-building my new gaming rig themed around WarMind; at least the latter is something I can easily change.

It's funny to think that just a few months ago I posted how much I was enjoying the game and its community, and how quickly that enthusiasm soured with the immediate ostracizing our group received.

I already know the majority of the kind of responses I'm going to get to this, so keep it to yourself if you're going to comment with some QQ crap. Maybe some of you will prove me wrong.

All we wanted was an answer to 'why?' and an opportunity to prove it was a wrongful ban, and everyone from forum users to community managers has come back with nothing but negativity and utter childishness, along with complete silence on Bungie's part. I worked for many years on MMO's as a dev, and I would be sorely disappointed in the team I worked with if they'd handled things this poorly.

And to the mods, seriously, screw you guys if you delete this post like you did the last time I posted about this when I was asking for assistance. I'm beyond asking for help at this point as everyone has shown they don't give a fuck.",1615921594,2021-03-16 15:06:34

DestinyTheGame,Could a Dev explain why Crimson was created instead of adding Red Death back into the game?,"I’m genuinely curious. Bungie does have a thing for exotic hand cannons—there are more exotic hand cannons than any other primary weapon type, by far (there is even Eriana’s Vow, a special ammo exotic hand cannon!).

The only reason I can think of is that they wanted to reuse some of the same ideas, but wanted to differentiate D2 from D1 during the early days. Chain lightning and lifesteal are both very common abilities found in many different video games.

Zhalo Supercell becoming Riskrunner makes a lot of sense to me. They promote sub machine guns, a new archetype, by creating a new exotic sub machine gun that echoes an old favorite with a new twist. Everyone also loves chain lightning.

But for Crimson...I just don’t get it. It’s basically a living meme considering Bungie’s over emphasis on exotic hand cannons.

Crimson is unique in the sense that it was the first ever burst handcannon (later we got the DOA Warden’s Law in Forsaken), but it just seems super gimmicky since it literally is just a 3 round burst that also heals the user.  The catalyst also just boosts the range...not too exciting. At least Riskrunner offers some unique perks.

Riskrunner feels like a spiritual successor to Zhalo while Crimson just feels like a gimmicky ripoff (no offense to Crimson fans).

It’s not like Red Death was broken or wasn’t iconic enough. It was a fan favorite, and even was able to hang somewhat before the peak of hand cannons dominance in D1.

Since Red Death was a pulse rifle that LOOKED LIKE an Auto Rifle...maybe the devs wanted to make Crimson a pulse that looked like an exotic handcannon? The problem is Crimson isn’t a pulse, it’s a handcannon, and the bullets damage are calculated oddly.

Again...I’m not bashing Crimson outright. But I am immensely curious as to its origins. Red Death was a PVP favorite in D1, and it also was incredible useful in Crota’s End to bypass Crota’s antihealing. Red Death also just looks super bad ass, has a really cool name, and had a reputation as “the banned Vanguard weapon”. We even got Crimson Spectre legendary auto rifles exclusive to Crucible, which was was really cool since Red Death originates from a modified auto rifle frame.

TL;DR I doubt it will happen, but it would be really cool for Bungie to explain why Crimson was created as opposed to bringing back Red Death. Since Crimson exists, I don’t think Red Death ever will come back, which imho, is a damn shame.",1615921410,2021-03-16 15:03:30

DestinyTheGame,Removing parts of Forsaken to make it “less confusing” for new players actually makes the game more confusing and shallow for new players.,"I know this definitely won’t change Bungie’s decision but I seriously can’t understand how removing content would make things less confusing for new players.

I remember when I came back during Season of Arrivals I was very confused about a lot of things story wise (and gameplay wise tbh), I was even more confused after I played through Forsaken and was told that Uldren Sov will be coming back in Beyond Light. Turns out it’s because I missed 1 cutscene from one of the previous seasons that showed him getting resurrected. 

One of my friends got into D2 and I basically had to explain to him everything whenever we played since he wasn’t able to finish the Red War campaign to top it all off he was showing some interest in buying Forsaken. I have another friend who is willing to give D2 a try but she’s dependent on the story, well that’s great because uh...there’s no story for her that helps establish this game.

If you want to talk about confusing you have the Presage quest. In order to start it you have to go to the Arms Dealer strike, which is narrated by Cayde, to pick up something and then in the quest you could possibly head Cayde’s voice who is ...supposed to be dead. Doesn’t this contradict the current story? (No please don’t take out the strike)

Without the Red War Campaign and Leviathan raids season of the Chosen can be confusing as well and I don’t understand what’s wrong with letting players advance the story at their own pace?

tl;dr: removing content just makes the game more confusing to new players just put a quick recap for major events?",1615921308,2021-03-16 15:01:48

DestinyTheGame,"Did you know that simply hits, not kills, with a Lasting Impression rocket will trigger Ambitious Assassin? (Rocket Launchers)","I acquired a Heretic, Aggressive Frame, rocket launcher. With it came Ambitious Assassin and Lasting Impression. After running some tests I determined that the triggers for an Ambitious Assassin reload is either multiple kills with the rocket, or hitting a single target with a Lasting Impression rocket. The Trait description does not mention this. Bear in mind, that having two 2 rockets in a magazine does not change this fact. Still, only one of these two rockets needs to hit an enemy before reloading to trigger Ambitious assassin.

While this may not be a game changer for ad clearing, given the difficulty of direct hits on smaller targets, this does provide the opportunity to unload 7+ rockets in a matter of seconds, which makes for huge burst damage potential.

My first and obvious choice is to use Sealed Ahamkara's Grasp, but there are many other exotic combos I'm sure. Ranged melees still trigger this reload, so Stasis SC with dodge to reload melee can work very well. 

You can hit a target, use first melee, fire off 2 more rockets, dodge to reload a single melee back, use melee again, fire off 2 more rockets, use final melee, fire off 2 rockets.

If you're feeling really bold, you can start off the combo sequence with an uncharged melee. The delay on Lasting Impression should allow you enough time to get to a safe distance before the first rocket explodes. If performed successfully, this sequence will fire off a total of 9 rockets, which is the exact number of reserves on a Heretic rocket launcher with 2 rocket launcher scavenger perks on.

Best of luck to anyone farming the rocket launcher from Altars of Sorrow",1615920257,2021-03-16 14:44:17

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, the Dreadnaught in The Witch Queen is a must have!","I think the Dreadnaught would be a amazing side location in The Witch Queen DLC, the [Road to Witch Queen](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50124) revealed they are delaying the release to early 2022 instead of late 2021 to give them enough time to work. 

The Dreadnaught has all this going for it

1.  fan-favorite location with gobs and gobs of hidden collectibles and challenges New Light and Veteran players alike probably haven't gone through yet. 
2. Rich lore on the Hive and the 3 Sisters (Oryx, Xivu-Arath, Savathun) which is relevant to the expansion as well as being interesting and slightly horror themed which the community has shown they like recently with Presage. 
3. Has strikes which with a few new voice lines could be perfect as they are already great and have strike specific rewards which again the community likes. (Much like S.A.B.E.R in the Cosmodrome)
4. &gt;! Connection to the Cabal (Calus/Ghaul) in the crashed ship!&lt; which is a huge factor of D2 with Cabal being relevant from 2017-2021 with the Red legion, the Leviathan, the Glykon, Caiatl  and more. &gt;!as well as being a perfect way to continue the Hive/Cabal line that has just begun with Xivu Araths destruction of Torbatl !&lt;
5. Chance to get the New Light guardians up to speed with the Taken/Hive going into the campaign
6. Repeatable activities, patrols, public events, transmat zones, lost sectors, and more
7. Tons of potential armor, sparrows, ghost shells, shaders, weapons, exotics, quests.
8. One of the if not THE best Raid in Destiny history that can be brought back much like VoG
9. Fits into the lore, The ship is just sitting in orbit right now. No changes or events that need to be explaine, its just...there
10. Way to satisfy the (Oryx is coming back?!?!?) and (Oryx in D2?!?!?!) and (Oryx's worm on Titan?!?!) conspiracy theorists

And Best of all, Its already done. With new graphics and voice lines as well as tweaks here and there the dreadnaught is a treasure trove of Lore, Loot, and potential just sitting there. The Cosmodrome proved these ""renovations"" can be done, Its a fast easy way to bring a amazing chunk of D1's history to the presence as well as a way to save time and effort on production instead of building a whole new planet/place from scrap.

I just thought of this when I saw the Dreadnaught in saturns rings while watching a old video about Titan, What do you guys think about this? Anything you would like to see return/left out? Might be a silly idea that is unrealistic but the taken king was my favorite DLC to date and I really want to see it return someday in some form.",1615919324,2021-03-16 14:28:44

DestinyTheGame,Nerfing/Fixing Omnioculus was a Mistake,"Fixing Omnioculus was a mistake.  The exotic does 3 things:

* Grants 2 smoke bombs.  
* Makes you take less damage while invis 
* Gives you smoke back when you turn an ally invis. 

That makes it THE exotic of choice for Pathfinders (bottom tree) in PVE.  But of limited use to other trees or in PVP.  

Players quickly noticed 2 other functions:
1. Going invis through ""other means"" (besides bottom tree smoke) also returned a significant amount of smoke charge - This included using the exotic weapon Rat King.
2. Running into smoke ""late"" on bottom tree had the same effect.

This ""unintended"" behavior made the exotic extremely valuable in both PVE and PVP for all 3 classes of Nighstalker.  Having a high uptime on smokes to slow Crycoclasm Titans with Felwinters was *helpful*.  Not even close to meta or broken--just kind of a fun thing to try to spec into.  It still wasn't as strong as Withering Blades or Duskfield Grenades.  

Last week, in the TWAB, Bungie acknowledged that the unintended behavior was a bug, but their promised fix left some room for doubt as to how badly the exotic would be nerfed:  ""Omioculus also no longer grants melee energy when making only yourself invisible under some circumstances. ""  it's an ambiguous sentence, but I maintained hope that only some circumstances were being fixed (The bottom tree late-invis bug seemed like a prime candidate).

It was the first thing I tested this mornng after the update, and sure enough ALL of the cool behaviors are gone.  Rat King no longer has any synergy.  Top and Middle tree no longer gain any smoke charge on dodge.

Top tree Nighstalker is a subclass that needs help right now.  I really don't think nerfing unintended benfits to a weak subclass was the right choice.",1615918587,2021-03-16 14:16:27

Quote:  

&gt;We wanted to share a change coming to Seals and Titles in Season 13. As I'm sure you've noticed, we've been shipping a Flawless and Conqueror Title each of the last three Seasons. We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!    
As always, we start with the goals:   
&gt;  
&gt;Allow players to show off their engagement with the core rituals season over Season.   
&gt;  
&gt;Preserve the value of earning the base Title.   
&gt;  
&gt;Decrease the amount of grind required Season over Season for players that want to earn them all. 

Yet as seen on [braytech.org](https://braytech.org) that the requirements for Conqueror Gilded is to do all 6 (seen here on my profile: [https://braytech.org/2/4611686018428608568/2305843009264934121/triumphs/seal/3776992251](https://braytech.org/2/4611686018428608568/2305843009264934121/triumphs/seal/3776992251))

this means you will only be able to Gild Conqueror 3 weeks before the end of the season. Meanwhile, Trials/Gambit/Unbroken could have been achieved since Week 1.

The only thing they said concering this issue is that a damage reduction was unintetended but the damage against bosses is still basically the same the only thing that really changed was the damge ""bonus"" against non boss targets so they didnt nessecarly have to have lied when they implied that they would fix any uninteded damage reduction bc when you just look at boss damage there technically wasnt a damage reduction so there is nothing to fix.

DestinyTheGame,My extremely fun warlock build,"My extremely fun warlock build that, while not being too overpowered, is very fun:

&amp;#x200B;

Loadout:

Top tree dawnblade with strafe glide for celestial fire

Claws of ahamkara for double celestial fire

Max strength for quicker recharging

Monte Carlo for quicker recharging and a chance to completely recharge

2 weapons for yellow bars

&amp;#x200B;

How to use:

Use celestial fire on EVERYTHING while in the air, even if you only kill one enemy with it each time, you will get 2 and wait a couple seconds and you will get another.

If you run out of charges, use Monte Carlo on a couple of red bars to get your celestial fire back.

If you encounter something that doesn't have a red/orange health bar, use your other weapons as celestial fire doesn't do enough damage.

Notes:

This is especially fun with brawler/solar singe on the strike rotation.

DestinyTheGame,Is Dragonfly spec essential/any good?,"Hi Everyone, 

Hoping that I can save myself some time and sanity by leveraging the community instead of testing it myself. Is there actually a boost from dragonfly spec? I've seen posts that it has not increased damage or distance, but am hoping that this was fixed. Does anyone have any experience or links to videos that could help explain?",1615915295,2021-03-16 13:21:35
DestinyTheGame,"4-12 person Nightfalls etc. could work, with some loot and achievements restrictions.","Okay, over rewarding events can destabilize a games overall balance.  I get it.  Once one area (such as 12 person NFs) is more rewarding, people will gravitate more toward that event, especially if it’s beneficial to do so.  This could cause population issues in other instances/events.

But as far as large fireteams are concerned, let’s face it Bungie, you opened a can of worms that can never be put back.  Almost anyone who participated had a blast.

So, how would a compromise look going forward?

An initial compromise would probably be “only drop rewards for the intended amount of players”.  So, if it is a nightfall, the rewards would be capped randomly at 3 persons.  This, 12 people, 6 people, or whatever, would share the loot of 3 people.  Etc.

Also, the runs should not count toward normal achievements.  For instance, a “flawless Presage” should not count if it was done in 4 or more people.  

I could also see changing the point requirements to 200k points needed for 4+ players, etc.

DestinyTheGame,Season of the Hive/Taken Love Anyone?,"Apologies for the long post incoming. Just excited/curious:

I'm sure some of you have recently seen the outpouring of support and love for SIVA in the last few days with Plague Gang, and Season of the Plague. In all honesty I didn't know people had such a deep love for the...concept(?). My question is, despite knowing that Season of the Hunt was arguably Hive focused and Witch Queen will more than likely focus on the Hive/Taken, why haven't we gotten Seasons dedicated to our Sword Logic loving boys and girls? 

I can only imagine the Season leading up to Witch Queen will focus on them and as said before, so will the expansion, but what do you guys think of the Hive having a run at a Season? I think Steeplechase was a good step in the right direction, but I've found it odd that besides Shadowkeep, armor sets and Hive weapons have been somewhat scarce? Only some of the weapons from Shadowkeep have Hive-like crust and mold on them, while the rest I'd argue look more in line with Eris Morn's pattern of armor/weapons. My fear is that the set we saw a few weeks back in the State of the Game looked more Eris inspired than say the sets we got in Kings Fall and Crota's End. If I'm honest...those sets from KF and CE are S tier, and I'd much rather have something look closer to that.

I'm not looking to bash armor design or anything, just curious if people are hungry for anything Hive related. I can understand if it's played out a bit with D1 being very Hive focused with Taken King and Crota's End, and so perhaps there is an oversaturation, but it seems weird that throughout the life span of D2, Hive focused content has been sparse. Just looking from vanilla D2 to what we have now, there are at least three Vex armor sets (the GoS set, the ornaments, and the Season of the Undying armor/ornaments), many, many Cabal sets that ranged from across the Leviathan raids, to even this Season, and more than a few Fallen sets (arguably the bulk of the Forsaken gear, which was also Awoken inspired).

And this isn't just armor sets or weapons I'm talking about, I also just mean lore wise. There's so much about the Hive that is fascinating *\*makes startling Toland noises\*.* And yet theres so much to explore. Like we still have no idea what Savathun's forces look like, despite her having a hold on the Taken. Xivu Arath is more than likely getting close to the system given her play in Season of the Hunt, and the idea that she's at war with her sister is just.....awesome. There's so much untapped story potential that Witch Queen is going to have, just thinking about it is....bone chilling. 

Hell, even the aesthetic is great. Shadowkeep is basically space Barad-Ur. I can't tell you how often I go to the moon just to explore the catacombs, because there is literally nothing else like it in the game *\*wishes for the return of the Dreadnought\**. There's a lot of Hive stuff coming I have no doubt, but compared to what we have its just so...little. This is especially evident as we look to potential alliances with both Fallen and Cabal, which would in theory only leave the Vex, Hive/Taken, and Scorn left (I do have a theory that the next saga of Destiny could potentially open up to players playing as these races as well as our current cropping of humans, Exo, and Awoken. Like you could play as a ""saved"" Hive that has reverted back to Krynn(?), Kryll(?), etc.).

I'd wager next Season could be Vex focused given the return of the Vault of Glass and Ikora's return to prominence as well as the previously mentioned final Season leading to Witch Queen being potentially Hive/Taken focused (but who knows?). 

So yeah, what do you guys think? Is SIVA more inspired because its been inactive for sometime? Would you like a Hive/Taken Season? Or is it played out, etc. Let me know below, just thought it'd be a cool conversation to have.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Thoughts on a Hive/Taken focused Season? What kind of armor sets/weapons would be cool? Is it played out? Or would you rather have a season of SIVA etc.",1615914976,2021-03-16 13:16:16

   * Rebalanced step 2 so that daily bounties grant the most efficient progress. 
* Battlegrounds: 

   * Players will now be refunded Cabal Gold when swapping Challenger Medallions.

* Fixed an issue where completing the Agonarch Abyss Ascendant Challenge wouldn't grant the Triumph for completion. 
* Fixed an issue where completing the Ouroborea Ascendant Challenge wouldn't grant the Triumph for completion. 
* Fixed an issue where Paradii, the Vigilant and Bakken, the Relentless could fail to spawn in the Blind Well area, blocking completion of the Double Trouble Triumph. 


##Platforms and Systems 



* Added quick launch Activity Cards for PlayStation 5. 
* Fixed and issue where some users were missing friends or clan members in their roster on PlayStation 5. 


##General 



* Fixed an issue where players would see incorrect spaceflight transitions when launching certain maps during Iron Banner or Trials of Osiris.

DestinyTheGame,Sunsetting sunsetting was a start now try this Bungie...,"The sun set on sunsetting and I'm thankful. But I think design wise Bungie still has the question in their collective minds; how do we keep the game fresh?

Well I can't help but notice that each season the champion mods drive my loadouts. Subtle changes that effect how I play champion based content like Nightfalls and Lost Sectors. 

But this has me thinking the seasonal artifact is key. Can we find a way to make those seasonal mods even more effective to overall gameplay?

What about a skill tree, what about specializing in say crucible or gambit specific mods that define the PVP part of the game the way champion mods do for PVE?

I think this eliminates the need to ever consider sunsetting again and move to meaningfully manipulate player builds in game.

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie has put themselves in a tricky situation. The stasis subclasses now revolve around a single stasis trick, upon which a nerf to any of it, will kill the class.","Revenant is getting nerfed. And thank god for it, can't wait. They're only going to slow. That means they're leaving the freezes to the warlocks, and I guess the....instant 1HKO stuff to the Titan. 

But let's try and break this down a bit and see what ability each class is good at.

* Revenant: Post nerf, they're pretty much exclusively the slowing class. The melee gives 4 stacks of slow, the dodge gives 4 stacks of slow, if they want to freeze someone they literally have to use three abilities all back to back to back _and_ be relatively close to the enemy too. So for all intents and purposes, in the average match, they're only going to slow. Hell, even the tornado slows. Slow is a powerful mechanic right now, but it's the only thing Revenants can do.

* Shadebinder: Freezes. Instant freezes. The rift is a 5 second freeze, the melee is a ~1.5 second freeze, killing frozen targets freezes more nearby targets, their super instantly freezes anything hit by the projectiles, they excel at quick and fast freezing. Cool. Good and well defined philosophy here, we know what they're good for. But with each nerf to freeze (frozen targets take less damage), it's tricky to imagine how well this class will survive in the future.

* Behemoth: Instant death and movement, I guess? The melee applies slow, but you'll be hard pressed not to get instant 1HKO'ed against a wall. Seriously, just try and use this thing in crucible and land a non-lethal blow. Then they have the aspect that instantly freezes anyone in front of them for 5 full seconds after sliding. They have powerful movement, and their super is the only super that can instantly kill any guardian just with the light attack (no set up, no follow-up, just an instant kill). Seems well defined, I guess, if not maybe a little much. But that's beside the point. This is a good class that is not tied to any one stasis gimmick.

Now here's the problem. Stasis slow is a pretty powerful mechanic. I think it's wildly powerful, but that's just the thing. Any nerfs to it will _heavily_ neuter Revenants more than any other class. I totally think they should remove the accuracy penalties, but aside from Duskfields (getting nerfed on their own), calls for stais slow nerfs are basically just calls to nerf revenants. No other class can slow.

And Stasis freeze. It's a very annoying high-death-chance mechanic that gives extremely little chance for counterplay. But it's being nerfed further, and when you're frozen, you're going to now taken even less damage (noted in the Road To Witch Queen balance preview). So this nerf is just going to hurt Shadebinders more than any other class in the game. Other classes can definitely freeze, but Warlocks excel at it, and they'd be hurt the most.

Behemoths are the only class that seem relatively immune to any general stasis nerfs, because their class doesn't rely on stasis, they just have a ridiculously strong slide and a 1HKO melee. Even their super can just instant 1HKO guardians without needing to freeze them first. 

**So while I think the upcoming balance changes are great and they lay out exactly how Stasis should have launched**, I worry to think on how Bungie is going to perform future balance changes. They can't do general stasis nerfs without these nerfs heavily hurting one class more than the other.

DestinyTheGame,If you're grinding Gambit for a god roll Bottom Dollar..,"In my quest to get a God roll Bottom Dollar, I have some information to share.

I did not keep track of everything I got because I never thought I would take it this far, but curfew in my part of the world gave me plenty of time to waste.

My seasonal Gambit infamy score is 200,000. Motes banked, 20,000.

My first Bottom Dollar was a decently rolled Quickdraw/HIR. I got it after about 15-20 matches. I should've quit then, but here we are.

At around 90,000 Infamy rank, I got a very very good Surplus/Explosive payload. But it just didn't fit my play style since I used abilities, the inconsistencies bothered me on a hand cannon. (I love it on my Frozen Orbit)

At approx 120,000 I got an Outlaw/Multikill Clip, which is awesome for 6s, but I'm more of a 3s type of guy. Still awesome to have in the vault.

At approx 190,000 I got a God Rolled Rangerfinder/Opening shot. It has a good barrel, steadyrounds and a handling masterwork. It's awesome.

That said, I still didn't get MY god roll of quickdraw/explosive payload.

Along the way I've gotten a few other decent rolls, I would say about 5 of them were good. But only 3 were very good. I would estimate all my BD drops to amount to about 25-30.

Another thing I noticed is I only got 1 with Opening Shot and probably 5-6 with Hipfire (FACEPALM).

DestinyTheGame,Warlock fashion is severely limited by the chest piece. Gauntlets need to change to stand out more.,"In Destiny 1, like the other two classes, Warlocks arm piece included shoulder pads. In the release of Destiny 2 Warlocks had this feature removed, their chest piece now dictates the shoulder area (unlike the other classes which still follow the Destiny 1 system). I could go on for how bad of a change this is but that’s been beaten to the ground, and frankly, it’s far too late to change it anyways.

What I suggest is this. Make warlock gauntlets more interesting. Take a look at Ophidian Aspect. Beautiful gauntlets with cool detail. Sunbracers are another example, bringing the design of the gauntlet all the way to the knuckles. Why do only exotic gauntlets get to stand out? 9/10 Warlock gauntlets look the same, they feel heavily limited in terms of design. One of my favourite Warlock gauntlets is the Liminal Voyager Gloves just because of how unique it is. 

With the new gauntlet ornament from the season of the chosen pass, we can see the gauntlets actually add rings to each finger of which are attached to the gauntlets by string which also wraps around the palm of the hands. Now I’m not saying these gauntlets look good, but it shows that legendary gauntlets can break the mould of just one single plate slapped on the forearm (Celestial Gloves, Wrath Trail Gloves, Intrepid Gloves, Moonfang, Iron Truage, etc., etc., etc.), wraps (These being bandages wrapped around the forearm), or back hand plates (like the single plates but with an additional piece on the back of the hand). 

Channeling CODA, and before it the Trials of the Nine gauntlets, are the back handed plates type but add a spine coming out. Steeplechase are just single plate arms but have a Thrall jaw sticking out of the elbow. More of these gauntlets that build on the subtypes rather than just changing the pattern are needed. Add more parts, make them flashy and stand out. Make them effect the hand. With Warlock fashion being tied so heavily to the Robes, please expand on the gauntlets.",1615910035,2021-03-16 11:53:55

DestinyTheGame,Prosperity mods should GUARANTEE you a playlist drop (with some bad math),"Currently from strikes you can get:


&gt;Royal Entry 9x10

&gt;Xenoclast 12x12

&gt;The Third Axiom 12x12

That’s 378 possible random rolls, not counting the first two columns. 

Crucible is even worse:

&gt;The Keening 12x12

&gt;Stars in Shadow 12x12

&gt;Frozen Orbit 12x12 

432 possible random rolls. 

Gambit is possibly better, but we’ll get to that: 

&gt;Bottom Dollar 12x12

&gt;Trinary System 12x12

&gt;Crowd Pleaser 10x10

388 possible random rolls (seems better right?)

&gt;Weapon roll RNG

So let's look at the RNG layers you need to get through for a weapon of choice, like the Grave Robber + One Two punch Xenoclast I’ve been grinding for since Beyond Light dropped. On the first column I don’t care, Barrel Shroud would be nice for bonus handling but it’s not required. Second column, I’d like Assault Mag but it’s not required either. What I’m strictly after is the Grave Robber + One Two Punch combo, so I’m looking at a 1/144 chance for that exact roll. On average 1 in 144 drops I get will be that roll, but it isn’t promised. It could be 20 or it could be 200.

Let's get a little more wild with the wanted roll through: Trinary System with Arrowhead Brake, Particle Repeater, Autoloading Holster, Tap the Trigger, and a stability masterwork. That’s (2/9)*(2/6)*(1/12)*(1/12)*(1/5). That's 1 in 9720 (I’ll admit this might be fuzzy because I don’t exactly remember how to do subsets of a whole mathematically but it’s a useful illustrative tool nonetheless). Now this is an absolute dream, and I’d be a little more flexible with it (namely Battery and Masterwork options), but we’re still talking into the hundreds for a drop chance. 

&gt;Drop rate RNG

Now, I can’t remember exactly how many strikes I’d completed before the emblem counter reset but I know it’s well over 1100 total now. I like them a lot, especially after I learned how to turn off Matchmaking. Solo strikes are the perfect balance between difficulty and commitment to unwind after work. This season I’ve completed 81 strikes. I’ve gotten some decent drops but I’ve completely given up on grinding the playlist for the drops, which is a shame because it’s genuinely enjoyable content. It’s just not a viable way to spend my time working toward a reward I want though. As much as I want the weapons, I’m looking at spending ~15 minutes between completions and not getting playlist drops for 5-6 strikes in a row.

What's worse than that? Gambit. I refuse to believe that the Gambit playlist drops aren’t bugged or have an extra 0 put in front of their drop chance, because there’s absolutely no way the weapons are dropping as intended. I played 25 games of Gambit last weekend and got 1 Crowd Pleaser. 1. A singular playlist drop for 3 ½ hours of playing a playlist (started at 2330, finished at 0330). That’s not depressing, it’s downright insulting. 

Bottom Dollar and Trinary System? Still undiscovered in my collections.

&gt;A solution

That is a lot of pretext for this point: A ritual playlist weapon drop should be guaranteed with a prosperity mod on your ghost. I don’t think having large perk variety in both columns is a bad thing, and there’s a lot of combinations that I’m excited for. Low drop rate on exceedingly random weapons means that drops I want are practically unattainable, and the drops I get only go to showcase just how stilted the odds are against me.

I reiterate that I’ve done 81 strikes this season (I'd wager 95%+ were completed with the Prosperity Vanguard on my ghost), if I had gotten 81 weapon drops I probably would have a decent amount of passable stuff but all I’ve gotten that’s worth keeping this season is a Third Axiom with Zen Moment / Dragonfly (workable but not great), and a Royal Entry with Impact Casing / Field Prep / Cluster (also workable but seriously outclassed). I've probably spent 20 hours in strikes just this season and that's what I have to show for it.

You know what an even better option would be? A togglable item in your quests inventory or on your seasonal artifact that lets you choose what weapon you want from each playlist. I would happily grind Gambit if I got a Trinary System from each game, and I’m sure many many members of the community would do the same for their perfect Bottom Dollar. 

Would it probably need to be bumped up in cost? Probably, because I know now after typing all this up I'm currently spending 3 points for what feels like nothing.

I'm sorry this is so long, it was a slow night at work and I'm not allowed to sleep.",1615909680,2021-03-16 11:48:00
DestinyTheGame,I think Banshee can be used to address the returning elephant in the room with sunsetting removed.,"So we've all seen post that Banshee is underutilised with how he's meant to be a gunsmith yet he's just like any other vendor, and yes this is another one of those.

Now that Sunsetting has been sunset the 'elephant in the room' I'm talking about that needs to be addressed is that the loot pool will once more quickly expand so that it becomes stupidly hard to get a specific roll on a specific weapon, but i think the solution to this would be utilising Banshee.

Basically, like before with Sunsetting older seasonal loot should be removed from the world loot pool, and then every day Banshee will offer three random weapons, Kinetic, Energy and a Heavy with as set roll but these weapons have a pool that consists of weapons that **have been removed from the games loot pool and are currently unattainable**, it will give newer players and older players that got screwed over by RNG a chance to get  older weapons with good rolls whilst also making sure the world or activity loot pool isn't too overcrowded.

The reason i said to provide one of each slot daily is mostly just because three seems like a good amount and one of each slot will make it so the RNG can't weigh heavily towards a single slot constantly like it probably would.

For what the weapons cost, probably just Gunsmith materials (Maybe also Telemetry to give it use)

Well that's all i got, just popped in my head.",1615909638,2021-03-16 11:47:18
DestinyTheGame,Destiny 2 Maintenance Megathread [2021-03-16],"Hey Guardians, 

Here's a megathread for the upcoming maintenance that will bring us Update 3.1.1. All posts about the maintenance will be redirected to this thread.

###Game will be brought offline when this thread is ONE HOUR old. Maintenance begins when this thread is 15 MINUTES old. Some features of third party apps (like DIM) could be disabled then, before the game is offline.

###Game Downtime is 15 MINUTES (until WEEKLY RESET).

###Patch &amp; Patchnotes should hit at WEEKLY RESET as well.

Please note that maintenance isn't fully over until one hour after reset, which means third party apps (like DIM, and your beloved /u/DTG_Bot) might not completely work until then!

So a season went by, with no news on an insanely cool ghost shell. Rumors that it was an early drop in for FOTL were passed around, and peoples' hopes began to rise once more. When it dropped, however, every single D2 player was remiss to find out it wasn't part of that release either; rather, the similar, yet vastly inferior 
Okular Fortitude Shell came out, which was objectively less good. 

As disappointments mounted, the number of people who held out hope continued to dwindle, and today, they are fewer of us left than prime servitors. The only thing unfettered is our hope. 

So Bungie, please, give us a bone. A sign. Say it doesn't work. Say it's a big prank. Say we found the wrong thing in the woods of upstate New York; we were supposed to find a code to unlock the shell, but someone left the life-sized Rasputin Javelin there by mistake. Just give us a sign. We need it.",1615908022,2021-03-16 11:20:22

To steal the words of u/Jaerthebearr, we are God-Slaying, Atomic Starfire Hurling, Immortal Guardians.  The Crucible can make you feel this way, but RARELY from Trials/Elimination.  Playing the Counter-Strike franchise throughout my life I get it, it can be very satisfying clutching those 1v3's to get the round win.  But in Destiny, something about a no respawn mode just feels off.  The pinnacle endgame PvP activity should reward guardians for doing what they do best, slaying everything in front of them.  Game modes that encourage constant conflict (Hardpoint,Oddball.....) would drastically speed up Trials for the good and encourage the use of more subclasses.",1615906289,2021-03-16 10:51:29

We are reaching the point of the season where content slows down.

If you feel like you need a short term break, this is the time to do it. Guardian Games (which &gt;!appears to take in elements from the Revelry and *seems* to revolve more around strikes this year!&lt;) will be when you may want to check in to see what's going on.


Otherwise, besides Proving Grounds, don't expect massive sweeping amounts of content. Story developments may happen but you don't need to be playing and grinding to see those.


Personal take on the season: I like how Battlegrounds are, a lot of enemies, but personally, I really think there should be some more meaningful content next season. Something difficult, grindable, and has a good targeting system (Chalice of Opulence?)

Pfft, if I wanted to punch people, I'd be playing an arc subclass or a titan. The titans get shown using their fist covered in stasis in their subclass menu and they get to use it. Warlocks get shown playing with a stasis projectile in their subclass menu that they also get to use. The subclass is also called Revenant, which is essentially a type of ghost. When have you ever heard of a ghost story where the ghost punches people in the woods or an abandoned house?

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you had a great week especially if you (like me) were farming Hand Cannons all week long since reset.

First sorry to all Trials players either you got a great roll, bad roll or no roll...mostly no roll for most. RIP   
Gambit had a ton bonus Infany so hope you guys played a ton. I did about 95 games, reset my infamy twice and got 6 bottom dollars ;5 of which were garbage and one was ok so I kept it. It about 6% percent chance for me so hope you guys had better luck.

But the real meat of this is the Palindrome farm, and Bungie, if you are listening (hope you are) seriously check for perk lockouts or something cause I did 150 NF runs this week. 149 on Master and 1 Legend and still till now in about 60+ Palindromes I have not gotten one Quickdraw Rangefinder. I mean damn. Quickdraw I have sen drop about 5 times and ranger finder even less so what gives? I mean I made friends and met a ton of people which you want us to do but Holy \*\*\*\* 150 runs and not even a bad Quickdraw Rangefinder?

Check the drop chances please and adjust it for those who really put time into this. peeps sound off in the comments how your farming went and hope you made some new friends like me :) The farm goes on untill the reset. Thanks",1615903858,2021-03-16 10:10:58

DestinyTheGame,Bungie trying to balance PvE AND PvP solely around the PvP crowd is really killing PvE. Rip Bakris next.,"Full disclosure I play all 3 classes pretty equally and I just started to get back into the game recently. 

Saying that, just last night I managed to drop the hunter helm exotic Bakris that changes the dodge into a mini teleport and works well with Stasis. 

My first response to that? Excitement because as I'm sure a lot of Hunter players know, most of the armour exotics are god awfully boring (oh you get two knives? Grenades do an extra skip? Wow mindblowing) and barely change the gameplay whatsoever. 

So getting to use an exotic that actually literally changed up your gameplay in a small way was super exciting. 

Now I hop on Reddit and what's the first thing I see? A big complaint thread about said same exotic about how OP it is in PvP. Don't get me wrong yes it and stasis and 500 other things and just PvP in fucking general needs some massive balancing.

But please leave it alone in PvE. There is NOTHING wrong with things being a bit more overpowered or gameplay impacting in PvE. Honestly Destiny needs more OP stuff you can form full builds around because the game is seriously lacking in the impactful build decisions. Because whether it's exotics, weapons or supers everything seems to get nerfed into the ground because of PvP when it isn't an issue in PvE. 

I love PvP at times (even though it's a hand cannon shotgun fest) but PvE is where most of Destiny's content is and is what most players engage with so for the love of god can Bungie just start flat out balancing them separately? We're supposed to be magical ass sci-fi space warriors with super powers not characters that throw a knife or smack someone in the face once a minute or use a 10 second ultimate ability on a 5 minute cooldown that should probably just tickle because everything's OP in PvP. 

I don't want to even bother investing in Bakris because I just know it will be nerfed into the void because it's good in PvP. Like poor Chaos Reach and basically the whole damn game at this point. 

TLDR: Please stop nerfing stuff just because it's ""OP"" in a completely separate part of the game with it's own ecosystem. PvE and PvP are polar opposites and for the most part also have polar opposite playerbases. Stop nuking the ""power fantasy"" aspect of Destiny.",1615903169,2021-03-16 09:59:29

Those puzzles could only be solved using some of the Black Armory weapons (before you freak out, they were VERY targeted, so they were trivial to get exactly what you wanted/needed for the puzzle) and the puzzles were pretty complex and difficult. Completing it got you an emblem and ghost shell.

I know Niobe Labs wasn't exactly perfect, but it was a really cool concept and combat experience, minus the bugs that plagued the Level 7 puzzle, and I really think having one of those experiences in the game again would be really good. It would allow this community to rally together and get to puzzle solving, something I feel we've been missing from Destiny since Season of Dawn.

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, as a player with aniexety disorder, I really enjoyed 12 man raid","In the past week I did 12 man Deep Stone Crypt raid twice. It was really enjoyable experience.

I play games without mic, because I have severe aniexety disorder. Before Beyond Light I did all the 6 man raids several times (GoS with div puzzle, CoS, LW, SotP, Leviathan prestige) and all of them were very stressful. Some encounters were really hard to do without a mic. I can only say 'thank you' to many patient players who helped me to get through these raids to get sweet raid loot.

DSC in 12 man group was completely opposite experience. I really enjoyed the raid. I did not felt any pressure or stress, but, of course, if you are careless, you could still die and wipe. The difficulty reminded me a Heroic Menagerie.

Bungie, I really hope that in the future you will ""accidentally"" re-introduce this glitch in the game. The best solution would be if you add official 12 man support for raids. Maybe even introduce some kind of matchmaking solution where premade fireteam of 6 guardians could look for extra 1-6 players to do ad cleaning and dps boss. For players like me, such feature would finally allow to fully experience and enjoy this awesome peace of content you did.

DestinyTheGame,Why Lobby Balancing is Often Set Up to Fail,"If you’ve been around Destiny 2 social media in the past couple of seasons, you’ve probably seen some complaints (if not several dozen) about matchmaking and lobby balancing in PVP activities. Whether it’s Control, Iron Banner, or Gambit, there seem to be quite a bit of mercies. I’ve been on both sides of them myself, and it’s really not fun either way. I don’t like getting stomped, and I feel bad as well when I’m on the winning side of an 86-15 blowout.

Some Guardians have blamed the lobby balancing, while others have blamed the CBMM. I’m here to tell you that both of those parties are partially correct. While there may be some small adjustments that can be made to the lobby balancing algorithm, too often the games are already set up to be blowouts before the first bullet is fired. In this post I’m going to look into why. (I’m going to avoid the general SBMM vs CBMM debates and instead talk about the flaws in the current CBMM and how we can make it better).

Let’s start off with defining the ideal matchmaking system as one that does the following:

* Gives the fastest queue times possible
* Keeps players close to each other ping-wise
* Gives each team as equal a chance to win as possible
* Achieves the first three while still allowing for a diverse skillset within teams

Since the [Season of Arrivals](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49254), all game modes except for Trials of Osiris, Elimination, and Survival use Connection-Based Matchmaking (CBMM). The way CBMM works is the matchmaking system searches for players near each other, regardless of their skill level, and puts them into a lobby together. At no point is skill thought about while putting players into a game; it just tries to put twelve players into a lobby together as quickly as possible based off their close connection to each other. The repeated claim I’ve seen here on Reddit and on the Bungie forums is that “it’s the lobby balancing” that is causing so many mercies in PVP. However, there are some lobbies that just can’t be balanced, because CBMM and bad RNG set it up to fail.

**Scenario #1: The Fireteam**

Let’s remember that CBMM doesn’t take into account skill when filling a lobby, but just fills it as fast as it can with players who have close connection to each other. Sometimes, the game is over before it starts because of who is in the lobby. Try to balance the following players on a made-up ELO skill of 1-10, 10 being high.

&gt;Fireteam: 8 8 7 7  
&gt;  
&gt;Fireteam: 4 3  
&gt;  
&gt;Solo Players: 5 5 4 3 3 3

The problem here is that 4-person fireteam with high ELO players; you can’t break up that team, so one team is going to be more skilled than the other. The best case scenario is combined ELOs of 36 vs 24 (8 8 7 7 3 3 vs 5 5 4 4 3 3). You just can't balance this lobby. 

If you don’t like that made up scenario, then here’s a real one. [This is from an Iron Banner game](https://imgur.com/a/85EvDyc) a few weeks ago (player names have been hidden). You can see that the average ELOs of the fireteams are 1611 vs 1082. Alpha team (which was a full 6-stack) had a 95% chance of winning, and they did win 80-25. Three of the players on that team had higher ELO than the best player on Bravo team. This isn’t even that extreme an example; I’ve seen fireteams where 5 or 6 of them all have Diamond ELO and they obliterate the other team. This game was over before it began, and lobby-balancing couldn’t do a thing about it because you can’t split up that fireteam.

“Well,” you might think “maybe if we made a Freelance mode, then this sort of thing wouldn’t happen.” Unfortunately, Freelance lobbies are prone to the same problem.

**Scenario #2: The Unequal Skill Distribution**

Freelance can have the same problem of an uneven, un-balanceable skill distribution even before the lobby is formed. Let's use that same 1-10 scale in a Freelance lobby (all solo players). Here are the first eight players pulled into a match in this scenario:

9, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2

Let’s pause here. At this point, you would really like an 8, 9, or 10 in the lobby to put against the 9, but you might not get that with CBMM; CBMM isn’t looking to make balanced lobbies, it only looks to quickly make lobbies and then attempt to balance them afterwards. Let's say the next players you get are 2, 3, 4, and 3. The lobby balancing algorithm makes the teams 9 2 2 3 4 4 vs 5 5 5 4 3 3. This might seem somewhat balanced (the 9’s team has a 24 combined ELO while the other team is 25) but what frequently happens in this scenario (according to the experiences of this subreddit) is the 9 may have a really good performance but he or she will probably lose because the rest of their team is not as skilled as the team they are facing. 50% of the first team is worse than 66% of the second team. The 9 will likely complain that their team can’t do anything while the 2’s will complain that everyone is better than them. I’ve seen complaints that this scenario happens in Freelance Survival, where the outlier players get put on the same team and none of them enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

The lesson that this community needs to learn from these examples is that **lobby/team balancing only works if you have a somewhat equal distribution of skill levels within the lobby, and any fireteams aren't preventing the lobby from being balanced.** So the question is, how do we fix this going forward?

# We need a hybrid matchmaking system. We need a matchmaking system that is thinking about lobby balancing as the lobby is formed and gives a slight filter as to who gets pulled in so that the teams have the opportunity to be balanced.

This is easier in Freelance activities like Iron Banner. After the first 6, 7, or 8 players join a lobby, the game analyzes its current player pool, looks for outliers, and begins a slightly more narrow approach to finding players so that the lobby has the opportunity to be balanced, instead of doing the best it can with an unequal distribution of skills.

&amp;#x200B;

If we’re talking about dealing with fireteams, that's a bit more complicated. Let’s remember that our goals are to give quick, balanced games, while also not pigeonholing high-skill players into “Diamond ELO only” lobbies. My opinion is that a good CBMM lobby will allow for a diverse set of skills in a game while also keeping the teams fair. I’ve read comments on Reddit advocating for “6-stacks should only play 6-stacks” but I think that’s too simple and also too strong of an approach. Sometimes you get fireteams that already have a diverse skillset.

Personally, I would like to see a matchmaking system where any fireteam of 4 or more Guardians with a high average-ELO would be put into a lobby that would give outlier protection, and only players above a certain ELO would be put into that lobby. It's not purely SBMM, but it should avoid the scenario where a fireteam of 5 Diamond ELO players ends up going against mostly Bronze and Silver ELO players (which yeah, been there, done that, and it wasn't fun).

I know some high-skill players really aren't going to like this, but I think there is a certain point where **the magnitude of skill difference in a lobby makes the game devolve into a disaster of a game that should never have been played.** One time I played against a 6-stack in Iron Banner and the final score was 90-6; it was a waste of my and everyone else’s time. I’ve been on the other side of those games too, and I feel bad for the other team when that happens.

Some players freak out whenever you mention the words skill and matchmaking in the same sentence. I’m not advocating for going back to pure SBMM, I want something in between that and CBMM. There’s a difference between a matchmaking system that allows for skill diversity but keeps teams fair and the current matchmaking system that just throws teams together without a care for the result. A good matchmaking system can allow for high-skill players to be put against average or low-skill players (thought I would like to see some sort of outlier protection for new and very bad players) while keeping the teams balanced, but it shouldn’t allow for KD farmers to stomp the opposition into oblivion every game.

TL,DR: We need a hybrid matchmaking system that allows for lobby balancing to actually happen, by thinking about lobby balancing as the teams are formed and using some skill filters on the back portion of the lobby.",1615892014,2021-03-16 06:53:34

DestinyTheGame,Please reverse the Chaos Reach super regeneration nerf for the PvE sandbox,"I’m no PvP player, but I heard that the Chaos Reach could be spammed relatively faster than other supers. Even though you can’t run across the map with Chaos Reach and eliminate an entire team, it was nerfed because you could use it more often than other supers. Fair enough.

But why one earth was it also nerfed in PvE?

Differences between the PvE and PvP sandboxes are being made more and more, yet you decide to punish PvE players because something can be a nuisance in PvP.

Come on Bungie, please reverse the nerf of Chaos Reach in the PvE sandbox.",1615884274,2021-03-16 04:44:34

DestinyTheGame,Bungie shouldn't ignore sunsetting as a future balancing tool,"*TLDR; sunsetting COULD be a good tool for sandbox balancing, IF it was selectively implemented with weapons meant to top the sandbox (I.E. Recluse, mountaintop, felwinters)*

with the likes of felwinters lie and future weapons that are MADE to be powerful and to take the sandbox by storm, could still be sunset

imagine next season a ritual weapon that completely breaks one sandbox or another, don't nerf them into there place instead they should come with a 2 or 3 season power cap,

this was the original proposal of sunsetting, powerful or broken pinnacles would be given there day in the sun and then, when that sun sets, they go with it.

i dont believe this should be retroactive, such as a general buff breaking a specific weapon shouldn't then lead to that weapon being knee caped,

BUT with the likes of the felwinters; it could drop with a sunset date, as it was meant to be powerful,

this could also be used as a testing tool, imagine if bungie dropped say a box breathing bow. this weapon COULD break the game who knows, but by introducing them with an hard end date they wouldn't be as big an issue. 

i also think 4 seasons is to long in this set up, with these weapons potentially rising high and long constantly scorching those that would go without",1615883411,2021-03-16 04:30:11

DestinyTheGame,Gambit is currently the worst and most wildly inconsistent mode in the game,"TL;DR- Gambit is a terrible, frustrating experience due to bugs, RNG, weird balancing, and melt mechanics. 

I have saved screen grabs of being at full health and getting two shot by a single AI enemy. 

I have screen grabs of motes sitting on the ground and just disappearing. And not ""I've been sitting here too long"" disappearing. I mean, I just killed the enemy, motes are on the ground a few seconds and then they're just... gone. For some reason, when the enemy team summoned their primeval, it deleted all the motes that were on the ground in our arena. 

I have a screenshot of EIGHT MOTES that have fallen through the map in the same area from killing an HVT. Not exactly worth hunting it down if half the motes it drops can't be picked up. 

When you play a strike, you feel reasonably confident in close quarters against red bars. Your primaries feel like they work pretty well, even against yellow bars.  Suddenly in gambit, primaries feel like trash and everything is tanky as hell. Its a jarring experience to go from patrol/strikes to Gambit. You suddenly go from being a god, to being a paper skinned bullet magnet, despite no real indication that you should be more cautious. The enemies feel like they belong in endgame content, not a non-level locked core playlist. And like those endgame level activities, the enemies glitch-teleport EVERYWHERE. 

Heavy ammo drops are inconsistent as hell. You can go several games without seeing a single brick despite having double ammo finder mods equipped. And then the next game, you have 12 bricks drop and can't possibly use all the ammo thats dropped. Meanwhile an invader can shoot 3 Eyes of Tomorrow rockets on an invasion, leave, then immediately invade AGAIN and pop off three more shots. RNG Heavy should not be a thing in any activity that involves PvP. 

What is even the point of multiple envoy spawns when you can melt the boss with Falling Star Titans and Chaos Reach Warlocks after killing just two? And why are the first two so tanky, yet the next two pairs can basically be sneezed on and die instantly? All this does is prevent the team thats behind from catching up in any meaningful way. 

Having an enemy team invade and wipe out your team on the first invasion of the match is devastating. Having them do it once and knock you back to zero, then invade again with the enemy having 75 in the bank before you've hit 20 is worse. Having them invade a THIRD TIME when their boss is at half health and you haven't even hit 50 motes banked? Just sit and wait for the match to end. That first invasion more often than not determines how the match will end. Its not exactly encouraging within two minutes of the match starting to realize you have little if any hope of catching up. 

Bungie tried to mix both modes together to be lazy and not need to maintain two separate modes anymore, and in the process they basically took Trials or Comp and put those players in with Quickplay guardians. The mote drain mechanic more often than not only serves to kick a losing team, or a team of solo players, while they're down. Removing the damage gating mechanic that was in Gambit Prime and allowing teams to boss melt right off the bat made matches shorter, which seems nice, but it also allows teams to absolutely murder the primeval far faster. 

Even having an invader who manages 3-4 kills every time during the enemies primeval phase doesn't really help now, because if the opposing team gets to Primeval Slayer 4, they can melt the boss in between one invasion and the next. I played a match where that exact thing happened, our invader was amazing, but because he didn't invade first, his first invasion only happened when the enemy team was at 80 motes banked. They had prevented our invasions by wiping us the first invasion and then draining us after that. He proceeded to invade every time after they summoned their primeval and managed to heal it back to full health or close to it every time, until we summoned our own. But by then the opposing team had pushed it past the halfway point and with slayer 4 versus our team of solo players not even at 2 yet, they melted their boss before he could go in again. 

The mode is a wreck. It doesn't feel good to play. Id equate it very much to being in the crucible right now- its frustrating, you run into sweats far above your skill level super often, you get completely dunked on often when you are playing solo, and it feels like you get the Gambit equivalent of Mercy 4/5 of the time. 

If they want to save the mode, they HAVE to do some tuning. It isn't Trials, its not Legend Comp, its not a GM nightfall. It shouldn't feel this bad to play. 

I recognize that there will always be a meta, no matter what weapons or abilities are adjusted. There will always be a ""quickest strategy"" to summon and kill the primeval. My beef with the mode comes from the experience being super inconsistent. One game, you are getting heavy drops, motes aren't disappearing or falling through, enemies don't seem to kill you so quickly, the teams feel balanced and you get a heart-pumping race to the finish. The next, you get killed 3 times by an invader while the bank always seems to be locked with 3 large blockers, the AI enemies somehow keep killing you even though your aren't playing any different than before, you dont see any heavy at all, and the enemy team kills their primeval within 15 seconds of summoning it while you dont even have 20 motes banked. And even then, the 3rd game YOU manage to be the team that dunks on the opponent. Having those massive swings makes it feel like, as a solo player, you can't plan or strategize much at all.",1615881010,2021-03-16 03:50:10
DestinyTheGame,Edited : Exotic update/revisit for titan class ability exotics,"*EDIT ; this is an older post of mine, the purpose of reuploading it is to introduce multiple edits, this was originally posted 6 months ago before Beyond light was dropped, yeah its been that long*

since travellers chosen has made the use of exotics made for class ability's more viable i thought i should post some of my brain farts in regards to QoL etc for them

DISCLAIMER : I MAIN TITAN HENCE THE ONLY TITAN EXOTICS BEING IN HERE, if someone would like to comment, for the other classes, (strengths weaknesses etc) i would love to make a follow up for Warlocks and hunters

also comment or message me your thoughts feelings opinions ETC, on this topic (see below for an important note)

**EXOTIC 1, KHEPRI'S HORN**

* this is a fun exotic the solar blast barricade, is cool and can be VERY effective if the star aline i have gotten 3 kills in 1 blast with it
* weaknesses
   * solar blast is only launched after the barricade is dropped
      * the summon time is killer,
      * this means you need to use it more like a AOE short lock down
   * the damage of the barricade is split in half with the blast initially launching forwards and then pulling back
      * this damage split is annoying considering that if a blast hits a wall before turning around you lose that damage potential
      * the damage blast also does weird slopping with it's damage
* My idea

1. decrease the size, HP and the duration of the barricade
   1. make the barricade more like a single person barricade
   2. (similar to the HALO 3 armour ability pickup deploy-able cover. or halo 4's hard light shield
2. MASSIVE Decrease to the summon speed of the barricade (about a 3x - 4x decrease)
   1. this would cover the summoning/timing weaknesses i state
3. change the solar blast's mechanics (2 ideas see Bold Idea 2)
   1. remove the returning blast, and replace it with a secondary blast released from the barricade
   2. damage (pvp) scales from 250dmg, at 0m-5m, 200dmg from 10m-15m, 100dmg 15m-20m 0dmg &gt;20m
   3. damage(PvE), does full damage at 20m this is because damage fall off on this cant be bad
4. **IDEA 2**
   1. remove the returning blast and replace it with THREE out going blasts with 1 going centre, and the other 2 coming off an 35 degree angle from the centre of the shield
   2. damage (pvp) scales from 250dmg, at 0m-5m, 200dmg from 10m-15m, 100dmg 15m-20m 0dmg &gt;20m
   3. damage(PvE), does full damage at 20m this is because damage fall off on this cant be bad

**EXOTIC 2, CITANS RAMPANTS**

* To be honest don't use it to much, so wont make any comments
   * has nothing to do with my skill with it being equal to or less then the frogs outside
* my idea
   * can aim where the barricade spawns (y axis),
   * the barricade doesn't suffer the current damage reduction instead has a crit spot in the centre of the barricade can be shot from front and back

**EXOTIC 3, CREST OF ALPHA LUPI**

* this exotic, is why?, the idea of a healing burst from summoning a barricade is a good one however it doesn't work in practice
   * this is my experience i dont know if anyone has had better luck with this exotic
   * see [Crest of Alpha VS Worm Husk, for my detailed views on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/j11gdp/crest_of_alpha_lupi_vs_wormhusk_crown_why_is_one/)
* my idea
   * these barricades are far larger,
      * going into the ground 1.5m
      * being taller, wider, (and curving around further)
      * ~~barricade is LEATHAL to enermies, (pvp)~~
      * ~~barricade pulls target acquisition (tracking, lunge etc)~~
      * spawn a buff orb for team (gun based buff and buff based on chosen barricade, rally damage, towering HP
      * rally damage buff is 25% against combatants, and 0% against guardians
      * towering gives 50% max HP and shield back on pick up, in PvE grants an over shield based on the amount of HP unused for heal lasts 6sec

**EXOTIC 4 HEART OF INMOST LIGHT**

* basically use 1 ability the other 2 become more powerful and regen faster
* this isnt a bad exotic but there is almost NO reason to drop an empowered barricade VS using it as a free ability regen buff
* my idea
   * make the empowered barricade have damage resistance to special weapons, and abilities
   * the barricade is bigger lasts longer
* this is to make the choose of summoning a barricade whilst empowered more rewarding

**Exotic 5 Icefall mantle**

* this is an great exotic, fun to use and changes how the game works but the timer and balancing aspects of the shield are a bit over bearing
* my idea
* Hold B (ability button), to deactivate the shield
* see [IceFall Mantle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/kbg8zu/can_icefall_mantle_get_a_deactivation_please/), for a full break down of my thoughts, opinions, and ideas

if you don't like these for any reason message me or comment, would it be underpowered?, useless?, overpowered?,. chances are you see an angle of this that i don't and i want to see what others opinions are.",1615880919,2021-03-16 03:48:39
DestinyTheGame,Paying for DLC on 2 Systems is not good. Will Cross Play fix this?,"I played D1 on PS4.  And much of D2.  Last year I have been playing on PC, but still have friends I want to play with on PS4, but I can't pay for all the DLC twice and most is paid for on PC (some paid for on both)

I really wish Bungie would allow you to use DLC on both systems.

Anyway, if we are getting cross play this will eliminate the problem by allowing me to play with friends cross platform, but will it also let me play DLC I paid for on my PC on the PS5?

DestinyTheGame,Exotic Bow idea,"# Kehpris Wrath

Damage Type : Kinetic, (makes sense latter)

Intrinsic perk : Rapid Oxidation

Exotic Perk : Scorching Flare

Bow Frame : precision

Draw time : 768

Catalyst : Kehpris Pyre

# Description/perk run down

Appearance

* recurve bow, that looks to be made of crack rocks, with rivers of magma flowing through the cracks

**Rapid oxidation : this bow fires a ""Burst"" of 3 arrows**

* this works similar to a pulse rifle,
   * with one original arrow and then 2 following glowing orange arrows
      * this effect will be similar to the luminite arrows from [Terraria](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Luminite_Arrow#:~:text=Luminite%20Arrows%20are%20the%20highest%20tier%20of%20arrow,%22echo%22%20dissapear%20after%200.7%20seconds%20of%20being%20fired)
   * the original arrow does 95 crit and 65 body
   * each orange arrow does 20 crit and 10 body
* this is where the Kinetic and Solar, comes in with the first arrow being kinetic and the following 2 dealing solar damage, thanks u/Steff_164, for the idea)

**Scorching Flare : Landing multiple arrows causes targets to BURN**

* landing the first arrow and one or more of the following arrows caused targets to burn
   * Amount of arrows hit and precision or not affect the duration and tick speed of the burn
      * the original arrow NEEDS to hit to trigger burn crit or not does nothing
      * the following arrow deal half effects on body shot
      * landing 1 crit orange grants 5 sec of 20 total burn damage
      * landing 2 crit orange grants 7.5 sec of 50 total burn damage

**Kehpris Pyre**

* increases burn tick speed, and duration (hard caped for PvP doesn't allow for a 1 tap unless 6 or less res)
   * increase is 25% increase in total duration
   * 50% increase in tick speed
   * the PvP hard cap is the tick speed so the 5sec burn still applies
* Grants Vorpal weapon
* decreases draw time down to 648

&amp;#x200B;

now if this sounds similar to Ticcus, it isnt. there is many differences between the 2 weapons, see the original post i made using this concept, [Exotic Bow idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/kr8wh4/exotic_solar_bow_weapon/),",1615879633,2021-03-16 03:27:13
DestinyTheGame,So what’s the setup for Sepiks GM later today?,"I was thinking: 

Succession(Anti-Barrier)(Vorpal)
Ticcu’s Divination(Wrath of Rasputin)(Overload)
Commemoration

Revenant
Phoenix Well
Ursa Titan 

Overload Bow to me feels like the most effective way to stun overloads atm, although the arc nades are good too. 
Ticcu’s can create Warmind cells for Ad clear and simultaneously is good for single target DPS.
Succession with Vorpal reconstruction is just great in GMs especially with the distance in this nightfall in the last two areas. 
Commemoration is just for the void servitors at the end and obviously LMGs hold a ton of ammo in general.

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, if you want to reduce FOMO, vaulting content is not the way to go","When this season started, Bungie said they wanted to reduce the amount of FOMO players experience. Yet just recently, they said in an interview that Forsaken content will eventually be vaulted. 

As someone who never got the chance to play Curse of Osiris and Warmind, it was really disheartening to hear that the content had been vaulted. I had to watch videos on Youtube just to understand who certain characters are and why their motives are the way they are. It almost drove me completely away from playing this otherwise amazing game.

Newer players are gonna start to feel this if more and more of the PAID expansions are completely removed from the game. I understand wanting to keep the file size down for players but straight up removing paid content is not the way to go.",1615878688,2021-03-16 03:11:28
DestinyTheGame,Vault of Glass......,"So hopefully many of you are looking forward to re-running the VoG. It was my favourite raid in D1 by far, the atmosphere was incredible and the feeling the first time you’re facing Atheon and the words ‘Guardians make their own fate’ pop up when you start mastering the mechanics was amazing.

What do you think they’ll change, do you think the old strats will still be viable?

For me although I think Champions being added is a certainty I also think enemy density will be doubled given the TWAB a few weeks ago. I’m struggling to see what they will change mechanically so I’m wondering if the power cap will actually be based at the pinnacle level right off the bat. I suppose a couple more wipe mechanics is a possibility plus moving the oracles to stop you team sniping from afar. Whilst completely safe.

I can’t wait to take my Hunter in there day 1, I’m actually hoping the first few encounters may also enable me to finally make use of my Zealot’s Reward somewhere other than GoS!

DestinyTheGame,How Bungie should incorporate 12 man strikes/raids/dungeons,"This might be a little unfeasible but..

We double/triple the number of ads but keep the boss health in strikes/dungeons/raids (depending on encounter) the same. Each activity relies on a timer system. Every time a successful encounter is complete, your time is added to a massive data pool of other times it took to complete the encounter, and judges that time. The better your time compared to others, the more/better loot you get.

The objective becomes to burn through these PvE activities as fast as humanly possible for the best loot, and the quality of loot is dictated by your team's performance with respect to the rest of the community.

This system is fail-proof when it comes to prodigy teams that will clear encounters flawlessly because the system would be based on the community's standard deviation of clear time (ideally). Perfect runs would be considered outliers (and rewarded as such) while people trying to game the system by farming slow encounters to inundate the system with bad runs will have to spend days doing that, something virtually no one has the will power to do.",1615878509,2021-03-16 03:08:29
DestinyTheGame,"The issue with the DCV is there's no garantee things removed will return/be accessable later, and no clarification that returning stuff will be the same, or changed, or even finished with Cosmodrone abandoned. Both points need addressing.","**Point 1: There is no garantee that things taken away will return at any point, due to the ""evolving nature"" of the universe, and if it did, it may come back altered from how people might want due to it.** For example, The Red War is something that happened in Destiny's history. You can't bring that back without another outright Cabal attack on the city. Ghaul is dead. Like, DEAD dead. Same issue with Oryx as another example. The Dreadnaught would need to come back in a new, adapted form, probably tied to Savathun, if at all.  


**Point 2: The Cosmodrone situation, while making sense from a development standpoint, hurts the very idea of the Destiny Content Vault. How can we trust the devs to make it work when the first implementation is abandoned?** For those who do not know, the Cosmodrone was the first piece of touted content, alongside Vault of Glass, to be announced to work with this system. The idea was that part of the area would come at first, then later on the rest of the Cosmodrone would be added in a later season.   


Later on, this plan was changed, because it was not feasable to do the new content they wanted as well as this. And with the world going insane due to certain issues, this is fine. But *it hurts the very concept of the content vault to begin with.* We were informed this would be done, for nostalgia's sake, and then it was not. The Validity of the idea of returning content, is damaged.  


**What should Bungie do about it?**  
There are a few options avalible. 

**Option 1:** Set up a concrete, *feasable* plan for what will enter the DCV, what will will be added to the game FROM the DCV ETC. Set up a rotating cycle, STICK TO IT, and let the playerbase know WELL in advance (6 months or so) what will happen, what will enter it and come out so they can prepare. Also, from here on out ***make sure that what enters the game is equivilent in both quantity and quality to what leaves.*** If Forsaken is removed, add content either old or new to the level of Forsaken.  


**Option 2:** Next generation consoles, such as the PS5 and the Series X, allow for the player to seperate different parts of game content such as multiplayer and single player in a game. Bungie could make use of this and turn the Destiny Content Vault into an ala carte system regarding former content. The details of this could vary. Perhaps old content could be added as you wish. Perhaps Bungie could have a B Team working on keeping the old content compatable with new. I don't know for sure.  


**Option 3:** Go ""Fuck it, this was a terrible idea, bring it all back."" Focus massively on downsizing the file size of Destiny while returning said content. Take the oppotunity to use the latest compression techniques or whatever. Streamline the UI and content to work better and explain itself well despite the possibly overwhelming level of content.  


**Option 4:** Ignore the issues here with DCV and hope it all goes away when you show off Witch Queen. Much like the titular bad guy, use deception to pretend the DCV does not have any issues, and people are confused by simple concepts like having too much content. Assume your playerbase are morons (And considering the amount of people who shoot at immune sheilds who can blame you) and dumb everything down, while saying it's all about player choice and making that simple.",1615878486,2021-03-16 03:08:06

He said: If you have the capability and you enjoy pvp, go for it. If you don’t, why bother? If pvp is so unenjoyable, you are basically working doing these challenges. You are paid an in game currency for the unpleasant experience. Because ideally games should challenge you and make you want to play more, then you have fun and get the reward. In this way, you are playing, not working.

kind of like in monster hunter the more people that join you raises the monsters maximum health. and it can either make it easier or harder depending on the monster and what kind of player you are. and some people really needed 12 man raids to push them to finally do one. and with their removal they might feel unmotivated to do them again. and you don't want players to feel like they cant participate. not knowing how to do a activity that mostly consists of players that already know what to do, and only ever want those same players can be overwhelming and discouraging to those who've never done one. but 12 man raids allows inexperienced players to still participate without feeling like a burden to the team.

[Example: 4](https://imgur.com/a/QS69C17)

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t blame my teammates. They’re performing at their best and I understand that. What I don’t get is why teams are formed so poorly, especially when there isn’t even a stack on the other team. 

These were all games I played where I was trying to have “fun” using guns like Night Watch, Mida Multi-Tool, Polaris Lance, Eternal Blazon, Mida Mini-Tool, Multimach CCX and Ikelos_SMG_V1.0.2. The guns were all so incredibly satisfying to use. I had a blast getting kills and streaks with them. The part that bothers me is that my teammates all seem to struggle so much regardless of how I choose to play. Whether I stick with them and team shot, or play like I normally would nothing seems to make a difference. 

Running with at least one friend usually alleviates the problem, but why shouldn’t I be able to have a balanced match while solo too?

Genuinely thank you for helping me overcome my depression and not letting me consume to my own dark time(was in bad state when I found this game, diagnosed with stomach issues, further testing showed that I only had one kidney by birth). 
My parents didn’t showed their pain, but I could feel their sadness. That week went in like what Eris felt when she was alone and lost her fireteam in crota’s end. But somehow she survived. 

I found this game same week when I was in bed for straight two days, not because of pain, because of feeling that my life just started (bye got married like an year ago before I diagnosed with that), so was really down. 

Had no guide or any idea or didn’t watched any videos about this game, just saw this game and had no idea why I bought this (1st game that I bought without watching any reviews). 

Thanks to all Those random guardians who helped me get my ikelos shotgun when it was staple for pve content, those 8 peoples got the shotty within couple of hours and me and one more guardian was the only who didn’t. But still stuck around for another couple of hours until we all got the shotty. 🙏 thanks to all those guardians.

🙏thanks to those guardians who got me through my 1st ever raid, The last wish, and didn’t used any kind of annoyed or bad words when I screwed up so many times, rather than they joked and joked and joked about it. At the end I got 1000 voices one my 1st last wish😂, our Sherpa who had completed the raid like 30+ times and didn’t had the 1000voices, he screamed so loud that riven must’ve came back alive😂, but at the end he was happy for me, than we did EoW and leviathan raids too that night. 
One of the best nights I had spent in past of couple of months. 

Sorry for long post, but Just a simple thank you to everyone in the community who have helped me in every aspect of game, those randoms, those lfg peoples, my clan mates and everyone.🙏🙏

DestinyTheGame,An actual Sanguine Alchemy build," So while doing some Nightfall runs this week, I got one to drop with a pretty decent recovery stat... so, I decided to try it out- cause ever since the rework I never bothered to touch it.  
So for those who don't know what it does now... while in a rift, if you get a kill... you get a buff of x1 that pauses your rift timer for a few seconds. At x5, it pauses your rift for 15 seconds before continuing it's current timer. And you can refresh that buff repeatedly and basically have a perma rift at all times.  


I figured it was... niche and pointless... but I decided to try and make a build that could solo all the Alters of Sorrow up to the boss.  
*BEHOLD MY CREATION OF BORDEOM...* as it's mostly just a Warmind Cell build. **But it works.**  


Bottom Tree Voidwalker  
Sanguine Alchemy  
Max Recovery (incase you ever lose your rift)  
Global Reach / Wrath of Rasputin / Rage of the Warmind  
Charged with Light Mod: Blast Radius / Protective Light  
Witherhoard  
Any Ikelos/Seraeph Energy Primary  
A rocket with Lasting Impression  


Find your spot, plop yourself down a rift of your choice (preferably Empowering cause you have Devour healing and Protective Light), consume your grenade for healing on kill... fire Witherhoard at the entry way... swap to your primary and spawn Cells... blow up said cells, fire rocket at boss.  
The damage buff from Rift combined with Witherhoard... and Alchemy... you'll never leave your rift as that damage buff lets you nuke everything. And if you have to... ya got your super. And Warmind Cells because **why not it's not like they're stupidly broken or anything...**  


Is this build practical? No, it's still very situational but... it at least makes use of the exotic in some way. **AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE TRYING TO MAKE USE OF THIS STUPID THING AFTER THE REWORK.**",1615872084,2021-03-16 01:21:24

DestinyTheGame,Probably time for Status effects to be fleshed out more.,"Title.
Sorry if this is all over the place don't post much and have been wanting to spit ball this out there.

I've been thinking about this since last season, but it would be a good time for status effects as a whole become more define and common. Similar to other games in the genre. I.e. Division, warframe, diablo, etc.,

For example,

Stasis/Ice/ Space Crystallization; Has the effect to slow and freeze your target. Personally, other than the nerfs it's receiving, I agree with most people that it should reduce accuracy. (Instead I think handling is fine, fits the theme and power fantasy and maybe even affect ROF but that could be to much.) 

The other sub classes status effects (burn, suppress, and whatever the f*** acr does) definitely could use love. Like burning being similar to the new exotic bow or Arc actually affecting your speed.

I, and likely thousands of others, have zero knowledge of vault of glass as we never played D1.

Day one contest mode could be fun but would spoil any first time fun by watching D1 videos while prepping.  A full blind run could be great if the mechanics are fun and challenging but not frustrating.  Maybe just a chill Sherpa run?

DestinyTheGame,Every Teaching Raid LFG Fireteam ever,"Coming from someone who hasn’t gotten a ton of clears but has been in enough groups to somewhat know what they’re talking about.

1. The Sherpa: Usually really nice, has some conservative opinions that occasionally come out but ultimately is polite and helpful.

2. The guy that has to leave after the second encounter: Usually quiet but polite, did their job well in the last 2 encounters but has to leave for some unknown reason. He will be missed.

3. The guy with 80 clears who replaced the guy who left: Every time someone leaves the person who replaces them is always the same quiet monotone guy with a shit ton of clears. Can sometimes be a bit rude but will always pick up for other people slack when they accidentally mess up. Will leave the fireteam without a word once the raid is finished.

4. The Irish/Scottish guy: There’s always atleast one. Usually nice and who you get paired with for any mechanics involving 2 people working in tandem. Would dap him up any day of the week.

5. The Asshole: Gets mad at everyone for messing up despite it being a teaching run, and him messing up just as much as everyone else. Kills the vibe and when he gets frustrated everyone just goes silent until he inevitably just quits and everyone starts laughing and clowning him for being a cunt.

6. Sherpa’s Friend: Knows the mechanics just as well as the sherpa, but doesn’t interrupt when the Sherpa is teaching everyone else. Just as helpful and polite as the Sherpa albeit more quiet.

DestinyTheGame,Melee builds shouldn't be punished by exploding enemies and shields,"Disincentives aren't balance. Being forced to run away from the enemies and go back to shooting because of a few cursed thrall ruins the point of a melee build. There are two very, very easy fixes for this:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Let melee kills knock the target away, just like finishers do. This would be freaking funny to watch, too.

&amp;#x200B;

DestinyTheGame,An automated lifetime ban without warning or explanation is poor customer service.,"One of my clanmates for the last few years got banned for life and it makes me angry at Bungie. 

He was running a 3rd party task manager app on his spare PC and booted up Destiny on that machine for the first time in years. He was banned within 30 minutes. No reason was given and he filed his appeal assuming this was the issue. He has thousands of hours in game and bought every DLC from D1 to now, bought Eververse items, and bought quite a few of the physical rewards from the Bungie store. I looked up his recent activity to see if he was doing anything suspect in his last activity but it was just nightfall farming (3 man). 

I am aware that such programs are forbidden in Bungie's code of conduct, but its an honest mistake. 

The appeal was closed almost exactly one calendar week from submission, which leads me to assume it was automated. 

This player has no history of suspensions, no sketchy crucible results, no toxic behavior. Any human reviewing the ban could have applied common sense to see that someone this invested in the game would never knowingly risk that a permanent ban. 

Once the appeal was denied, there is nowhere else to go. 

I know I'll get negative comments for whining and people defending Bungie's right to do whatever they want with their product. But I bet you'd be pretty pissed if your account was banned for an innocent mistake and all of your purchases were gone.",1615862435,2021-03-15 22:40:35

DestinyTheGame,Would it break the game if we got rid of kinetic/energy slot locked weapons?,"Like what if every primary/special weapon could go in either slot? I feel like that would be a great QOL choice in response to the lack of kinetic special weapon options. I also don't really see a need for balancing loadouts based on damage type slots. 

I see a few ways of doing this:

1) Leave all guns as they are and let people use 2 energies/2 kinetics

Pros:
- easier to implement
- guns stay familiar
Cons:
- potentially devalues kinetics (though they would still do more damage to unshielded enemies)
- kinda defeats perks like Osmosis



2) Give all guns an element and have it only be active in the energy slot

Pros:
- keeps the kinetic/energy dynamic
- makes energy choice more meaningful than option 1
Cons:
- potentially harder to implement (but not by much probably)
- might break perks specific to energy weapons
- not sure what a normal kinetic fusion rifle would look like (as bastion fires slugs but normal FRs do not)

DestinyTheGame,Destiny old head that got new joy from Season Of The Chosen,"I will start this with saying that I’ve been playing off and on since the Alpha of Destiny 1. (Titan main for days) I love these games! Bungie is responsible for my love of the FPS genre. I’ve had spots here and there where I lost interest with the game. But I always came back fairly quickly. Until the Forsaken expansion. I just started to not enjoy myself when I played the game. The grind felt pointless, unrewarding and in some cases punishing. I tried my hardest to soldier through, but I just couldn’t bring myself to struggle with the monotony. Fellow guardians of my fire team came and went. I was alone with no urge to forge forward. So I stopped, until Season Of The Chosen was released. 

For some reason i booted up the game randomly a few weeks ago. Now I’ve gotten a new lease on this game. Much to my surprise, it’s fun again. Now I’m not saying it’s perfect by any means. But the grind and the hunt is much more enjoyable. Rewarding, meh. Fun and enjoyable, sure. 

Gaming has gotten me through many of my life’s events. Destiny being a big part of that escape from reality we all need. The root of this post is just a thank you. To Bungie for making a great world for us to inhabit and explore. My fellow guardians that were random fill or LFG’d and fought by my side. 

Thanks for the help. In more ways then I can count. 

Take care, and I’ll see you star side guardians.

DestinyTheGame,Possible Lost sector Loot Bug.,"Grinded out about 22ish Concealed Void runs at 1300 for helmets on my warlock today.

I clear my engram space and get a Stag helemts like 5 or so runs laters. Back into and around run 18/19 get another exotic drop bit my inventory is full and it goes to postmaster again.  I feel bad that the farming g sucked today and go and grab from postmaster.

**I was running Legends for exotics helmets.**So that's what I expected from the engrams. They both decrypted Into mantle of battle harmony, **the exotic chest piece.**

On the moon the master lost sector is dropping chest exotics. 

Clearly this and to be a mistake. Out of 3 runs I the Lost sector getting an exotic drop. 1 was actually a hel.et and the two that got sent to the postmaster. Decided they wouldn't be Crown of tempest drops I'd be proud of an instead made me even more dissapointed.

Not sure if Bungie or anyone else has ran into this issue. But clearly there's a big happening

**Destiny 2's 12 Man Activity Glitch Needs To Be A Feature In The Future**

Between the interesting unfolding of the Battlegrounds, there has been an extremely fun aspect these past 2 weeks. I am speaking of no other than 12-man activities. With some precise timing and luck, players have been breezing through several activities in more Fireteams than intended, and my oh my, has it been a blast. This glitch only works with non-matchmade activities, so thank the Traveller you won't be facing a team of 12 in Control, Gambit, or Trials (which is disabled, again).

It's the last day of 12-man activities in *Destiny 2*, as Update 3.1.1 will be patching this on weekly reset. Bungie needs to make 12-man activities a thing in the future. While I don't mean that they should launch every of the upcoming activities, for example the returning Vault of Glass with room for 12 players. However there is a certain aspect of fun and chaos to it, call it Mayhem Mode, if you will. 

Most activities in the game are set to Fireteam members of 3 and 6, but having an extra Fireteam or two has never been more glorious. The filled to the brim roster page, the sheer number of Guardians in a small room, how quickly enemies can be defeated, even the other way around (looking at you, Exploder Shank from Fallen S.A.B.E.R), and have I told you of how hilarious it is to stomp a Fallen Skiff down? 

This has been a great way for new players to try out various non-matchmade endgame activities too, I've lost count of the numbers of 12-man raids I've joined where several were raiding for the very first time as they looked around in awe of what a raid has to offer. As RNG would have it, some lucky ones were blessed with the raid Exotics on their first try. It easily brought a more welcoming feeling to them to try more of these activities, no matter how little the participation.

12-man Fireteams have also brought cheeses to several Triumphs, such as the Tale Told Triumph in the Exotic Quest: Presage. Players have to complete the mission on Master difficulty without dying, but you can easily sit at spawn while the 11 other Guardians in your Fireteam breeze through the mission. With it rewards a lovely Tex Mechanica themed emblem.  

Props to Bungie for letting the glitch stick around for players to have fun for a while rather than patching it immediately. Bungie could either have the option to create an activity for 12-man Fireteams, but that may be tricky in terms of mechanics as you'd have to factor in so many Guardians, not to mention how quickly you could melt a boss’ health. While I do understand that these endgame activities are a source of high stat loot and resources, that it may break the reward structure if 12-man Fireteams were active all the time, I would love to see a return of it for the sake of players who face difficulties in tackling them and for some much enjoyed fun. 

I believe the appeal is more towards the fact that *Destiny 2* players miss and want a 6 player matchmade activity. I know I have complimented the targeted loot farm back in Menagerie several times, the Menagerie also had casual fun for all its players. Back then, players would be able to farm multiple copies of any weapon/gear they desired after a glitch was discovered by loading back and forth between areas. Being able to load into an activity with 12 people has somewhat effectively filled the experience of Menagerie’s absence. 

If this 12-man glitch were ever to return in the future, there’s several possibilities that Bungie could add. Additional modifiers, harder difficulties, exclusive challenges and perhaps exclusive loot and mods! You may recall in April 2020, a double loot glitch from the Nightfall Warden of Nothing had eventually turned into a feature where we periodically get double loot from Nightfalls, so here's hoping that 12-man activities will have the same fate. 

Until then, treasure the remaining time of this unique glitch we have left Guardians, and an early good luck to those who will be attempting Grandmaster difficulty on reset.",1615859622,2021-03-15 21:53:42
DestinyTheGame,maybe we already know who the darkness statue is.,"so i was reading into the strangers timeline stuff and found the whole corrupted Eris stuff super interesting. she essentially becomes the posterchild of the darkness. we know the forces of light and dark have some prophetic abilities, maybe they used them to know about this future and how she uses the dark powers, so they made it in her image. I'm clutching at straws with this last part but it is a feminine figure draped in some kind of covering, maybe this is like an evolution to the eye covering she wears or something. there's not exactly a whole lot of evidence for this but I think it'd be cool if this was the case. Maybe evil Eris used some sol divisive tech to plant the pyramid on the moon in the past, guarantee the dark transformation or something. even if this is just some crack theory, its an interesting idea.",1615859617,2021-03-15 21:53:37

DestinyTheGame,People that enjoy crucible: how?,"Keep in mind this is my OPINION and you are allowed to have an opposing opinion without being an ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not great at PvP in this game and I proudly admit that. But I can recognize situations where it’s just because I’m bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m playing to try to get a frozen orbit and I have never been more miserable playing a game. 

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of things that instant kill you is astonishing. I’ve played so many multiplayer games and this is by far the worst experience I’ve had. It feels so unfinished. It feels like they’ve created so many weapons and armor pieces and abilities and there’s just no way to manage them all. So many of these things are blatantly useless. Also some things are just straight up better than everything else, which seems like very poor balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Spawning into supers, spawning into enemies. Supers are essentially free kills. Being able to “add aim assist and accuracy” is such a beyond strange concept to me- you can just put a mod on and it compensates for inability to aim? 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole of PvP just feels like there should be a huge “Beta” sticker slapped on it. It’s fine when people are better than me, and there definitely are a lot of people! But a lot of the time I just feel like there’s absolutely nothing I could have done to not get one shot by something, which happens so so often. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not even mentioning there are like 3 maps, matchmaking is actually laughable.. also you have an astonishing number of people “win trading” in PvP because they want the rewards from something that is so painful to play. (Which is definitely lame, not a fan of win trading obviously.)

DestinyTheGame,I have a question about a particular Shotgun.,"Here in Destiny 2, we've had many broken things in the past, and many broken things now. An example: Lord of Wolves, Recluse, Mountaintop, One Eyed Mask, Contraverse Hold, Backup plan Fusion Rifles, Arbalest, Jötunn. Granted, most of those things were nerfed and/or are sunset. But here in the current meta we have Felwinters Lie. A shotgun pinned to an 8.5m OHK range with Opening Shot active, where it's only redeeming quality is consistency. While we still have Fusion Rifles like Glacioclasm running around and Jötunn. So why is everyone complaining about a Shotgun pinned to 8.5m when a Fusion Rifle can consistently kill at 15-20m and even farther with the right role? Maybe I'm bias, as I don't find myself dying to Felwinters as often as others. But just a thought. Don't attack me lol.",1615857171,2021-03-15 21:12:51
DestinyTheGame,Postmaster Frustration,"Lemme start by saying I'll accept my part of the blame for not watching my postmaster closely. My bad.

That being said, losing 100+ enhancement prisms and ALMOST losing 7 Ascendant Shards (thank goodness I caught it) is really frustrating.

Why is there no inbox priority? Is it really so hard to code ""x exotic/legendary = greater value than rare item""?

Why doesn't the postmaster have more space? After playing the Blucible, Gamblue and Blueguard Strikes, my postmaster can fill up without noticing. 

Why can't I put prisms and shards into the vault?

Dismantling them makes gunsmith materials, which you turn into gunsmith and if the gun isn't good, you dismantle it into more gunsmith materials, which is a different issue all on its own.

I remember in D1, after you reached a cartain point, white /green engrams would just auto decrypt into materials. Can we get that after hitting pinnacle cap? Or maybe even a toggle? I'm getting so bored of holding ""dismantle.""

Bungie has demonstrated some amazing Quality of Life changes. I think the postmaster needs some love too.

DestinyTheGame,Game breaking bug,"UX/UI bugged for anyone else?

This issue is happening on a PS4:

When I try to equip a weapon or piece of armor it doesn’t equip. It stalls for a second then the item disappears. If you close the the menu, the item is back but your original load out is still on. 

If you try to delete an item, it doesn’t delete it just stalls and never deletes. 

It happens when turning in bounties, as you finish the the button hold, the bounty enters the animation but stalls and never turns in. 

When I go to unlock a perk on the artifact, it upgrades the perk I pick, it unlocks but then when I try to unlock the next the unlock never cycles through. This is frustrating because I just reset it to experiment with different builds and I needed to do the EXO master challenge for an aspect. 

But, even if I was able to unlock a new perk, I can’t equip it because whenever I go to a piece of armor to change the mods, they act like they are changing during the button hold but the mod turns white and never applies. 

I can grab bounties and change my load out via Ishtar and the Destiny app so I can still play some content except when I want to change my class/sub-class, it just stalls when you select the new one. Cool, I’m stuck running voidwalker, I’ll just run out some mindless battlegrounds, work on some catalysts. 

But, I can’t do that because when I go to socket my hammer, you guess it, I hold down X and the Medallion goes white and just stays there and never sockets. 

I tried resetting as well as turning off my PS, still doing it. I even thought it might be lag in my internet so I did a hard reset as well.

Tell me I’m not the only one who is experiencing this? I scuffed the most recent posts and didn’t see anyone mentioning it. Sorry if they are already aware.

DestinyTheGame,How to succeed in crucible for the disabled.,"Hi everyone, 

I just wanted to offer a quick guide to help anyone that maybe is having a really tough time in crucible, especially due to an illness or even limitating setups (eg can't afford an adequate gaming chair). 

Here are my tips categorized by ailment.

Cataracts/arthritis/ other barriers to aiming: might I suggest using a crispy new 120 hand cannon. The archetype comes equipped with an inherent perk allowing you to hit criticals for approximately half your opponents HP around corners, from the air, and even when aiming at the peen. 

Dementia/not fully developed brain: if you find yourself at either ends of your lifespan, it can be really hard to engage the game with a sense of strategy/foresight. So for you I would highly recommend using Hunter, whose ability to roll around on the floor will help you to survive bad situations you unwittingly walked right into. Effectively negating all repercussions for the poo poo brain mistake you should have died for, you stupid monkey. 

Additional insurance for the above medical limitations can be found in equipping stompers and a chonky Felwinters lie. For you see, both together allow you to dominate your opponents despite your lack of gunskill/positioning. 

Lastly, for those of you who are suffering from either  Erectile Dysfunction or an abnormally small penis, I believe the Darkness is offering something you might be very interested in. 

Now go forth and show everyone in quickplay how much better you are than them with these tips, you impotent buffoons.

It causes me to avoid large player activities since I have a lot of stress about things like Mics and ""know how"" of mechanics and such. 

Over the years Bungie has hit some home runs for me in terms of an alluring activity that doesn't give me social anxiety: 

1. Court of Oryx: For me the feeling of walking into that part of the map while some epic battle was going on and trying to rush to that side of the room to join is one of my top gaming moments. 

2. Forge of Iron: Loved the rewards, hated the ""matchmaking"". 

3. Menagerie: It's like a Raid without the pressure!

Last week I found out about the multiple player glitch and wanted to try it out and see if it took some of the pressure off me.Thanks to large player activities in the last two weeks, I have:

2. Cleared Deep Stone Crypt for the first time. It was still really nerve wracking though. 

3. Made 9 friends on steam which I didn't have before.

Week 9: “Feels Good To Be Bad” Kill 40 guardians in gambit. Bonus progress for kills while invading.

**Additionally here’s some other painful ones:**

* Complete a GM nightfall (week 6)
* Win 7 Rounds of Trials of Osiris (week 7, also gives you a random trials weapon when you complete it)
* Get each of the ornaments for Salvager’s Salvo (weeks 6-8)
* Earn 5 Valor ranks (week 7, matches the gambit one from this week)
* Get 80 guardians with elemental kills in Iron Banner. Bonus progress for stasis kills (week 10)
* Kill 50 combatants in the new strike IN IT’S NIGHTFALL FORM with a linear fusion or a sidearm (week 8)
* Kill 20 boss or elite cabal in the new strike (week 10)
* Kill 400 targets while wearing a matching armor set. Bonus progress on guardian kills. (Week 9)
* Kill 600 targets with grenades or rocket launchers. Bonus progress for multikills. (Week 10)

There’s a few more gross ones but these are the ones that I think most people are gonna complain about.

I had to go on a hunt to discover what original gambit weapons were still not sunset.

The answer is, no specials, and just one heavy.

The curated Bad Omens from Drifter, (I dismantled all my other Bad Omens) for heavy, and gnawing hunger, lonesome, and Nightwatch for primaries. also, malfeasance counts, I believe.

Python is sunset.

last man standing is sunset.

Sole Survivor is sunset.

doomsday and just in case: sunset.

DestinyTheGame,I quit Destiny 2 a couple years ago. Curious to see if any of my issues have been solved or still remain.,"I quit Destiny 2 around Autumn 2019 after playing extensively since launch. I stopped because I had a sort of ""epiphany"" that changed the way I viewed the game and made it so it was no longer fun. I don't know why it took me so long to realise these things but once I did, I couldn't go back. So I'm wondering if Bungie has made any differences over the last few years that would make me want to come back.
My problems:

1. Honestly this is the BIG one. Most of the other things on this list I could ignore or deal with but this was the one that ultimately made the game no longer fun once it clicked for me. The game is just one giant skinner box. You are just forever chasing the new weapons and armour. Finally you get them, then a month later some new content comes out and those weapons and armour you spent so much effort chasing are now irrelevant. Sure, there are often exceptions where something is meta for a long time. But that is often because it is particularly overpowered and to not use it puts you at a disadvantage because everyone else is sure using it. It's not like everyone used them because they're fun to use or whatever. About a year or so after I quit I read about them introducing ""sunsetting"" or something? So instead of MAYBE an item you liked becomes irrelevant, it inevitably became irrelevant? Did I interpret this correctly? Did they reverse this decision? Because it sounds the exact opposite of what I. and I assume others, would like.

2. I thought about putting this in 1 because in order to get those weapons and armour you have to do the same things over and over and over and over again. Now I understand this is some sort of mmofps so brainless grinding kind of comes with the territory, but for me, the best Destiny 2 content was always fun and unique quests. Stuff that had you go to a new area, do new things and showed you cool stuff along the way, not just ""Kill 500 players in crucible"" or ""Complete 200 strikes"".

3. Forcing people to play content they dislike. For basically everything, there would usually be some quest step that involved playing something you didn't particularly enjoy. Be it crucible, strikes, raids, whatever. I understand this, Bungie obviously want people to experience everything rather than segment themselves into factions. But it became extremely frustrating when a meta weapon was locked behind 50 quest steps, all requiring you play a mode you despise. Now, to be fair, around when I stopped playing, they did start having quest steps that let you choose, for example, ""kill 10 players in crucible or complete 2 strikes"" but this was only on a few things. Is this still a thing? Did they expand it to all, or at least more, items?

4. Bungie's disregard and seeming contempt for people without friends. Look, I'm a friendless loser who has many anxiety issues that prevent me from acquiring friends and prevents me from using voice chat. Because of this, a lot of content was literally locked away from me. All raids were out of the question because they were impossible to do without friends or at least voice chat, which isn't an option. Literally everything else in the game doesn't require this. For everything else you can matchmake to get random people to join you and none of it requires voice chat. There are many great examples of games which create content that requires multiple people, but a) provides ways to matchmake and b) provides ways to get around not having voice chat. Look at a game like Journey for an excellent example of this. Look at Apex Legends with it's excellent ping system. This isn't a dig at people who like raids. I'm not asking Bungie not to make them. It just always really sucked for all of this content including weapons and armour to be gatelocked from me, especially when there are so many good examples of games that still has that co-operative element but without needing such a high level of coordination (not sure if that's the right word, hopefully you understand what I mean). It also really sucked because of my next point.

5. Bungie very clearly rewarded raiders a LOT more than everyone else. It's like they think of raiders as their favourite children and everyone else as the runts who occasionally get a few scraps. That's probably a little bit of an exaggeration but every time a new content patch dropped, it would ALWAYS play out like this: new content releases, everyone begins the grind to the new light level cap, for regular people it takes a few months, for raiders it takes a couple weeks. It was so disheartening to see just how damn quickly raiders would take to rank up/level up/whatever the appropriate term is. Raiding just absolutely showers you with powerful engrams. Whereas regular content usually gave you just one. Now, you can make the argument that raiding is more difficult and so deserves higher rewards. Sure. I'm just saying the ratios felt off and that raiders should either get fewer powerful rewards or regular players should get more. It would also be nice if Bungie offered an alternative way to get some of the weapons and armour associated with raids. I'm not saying you shouldn't get unique rewards for doing raids. But some stuff, like exotics, it just felt really unfair to never be able to get and similar to point 3, it would be nice if these could be got in multiple ways.

6. Titans being overpowered in pvp. Probably my most controversial point but I always felt this was the case. They're the only class that always had a one hit melee kill. Turning a corner and seeing a titan running at you was almost always a death sentence and there was absolutely NOTHING you could do about it. How is that fair? They also had easily one of the best grenades, I can't remember what it was called but it was one of the lightning ones that did an aoe pulse. That thing was also often certain death. Oh and titans got the exotic that gives you two grenades. Speaking of exotics, fucking one eyed mask. That thing was the most broken piece of shit I have ever seen in any video game ever. It was actually disgusting. It took Bungie far too long to nerf it and when they did it was still too powerful. I'm sure I'm going to get comments saying hunters had this and warlocks had that so it was fair. Whatever. I'm just saying in my view, it felt like titans were way too strong in pvp.

7. Scout rifles being useless. I really hope this one has changed because it was the easiest to fix. When the game first came out I absolutely loved scout rifles. Especially the MIDA Multi Tool. It was genuinely one of the funnest guns I'd ever used in a game. Perhaps it was a little strong and deserved it's nerf. But what it didn't deserve was to become irrelevant like all scout rifles did. I don't know what they did, what changes to the code they made, but if you played back then you surely remember it. Literally no one used scout rifles because the damage from them was just utterly pathetic. It was just sad. Please tell me they fixed this at least?

This became a lot longer than I intended. Apologies. I guess once I got in a ranty mood and the dam was broken, it all came pouring out. I really would like to get back into the game as I have missed it, but I'd like to know if some of these issues were addressed before I go opening old wounds. I saw an article recently saying they were bringing back permanent shaders and finally introducing transmog. It seems like they're taking good steps. I'm curious to see if these fix some of the issues I had.",1615853945,2021-03-15 20:19:05

DestinyTheGame,Please don't sit on your Super,"I don't know whether to flair this Guide or SGA, but please if you're in the Crucible, **use your Super.** Do not wait for that dream moment when you can get a team wipe.

If you use it once you get it and get even just 1 kill (whether it's 6s or 3s), great, you just won a free team fight, kept your special ammo (and got more) AND you're on your way to your next Super. If you get a team wipe? Even better! But **1 kill is better than none!** This goes for any mode - QP 6s, IB, Comp, Showdown, Trials, anything!

Pretty much every Super in the game can guarantee at least 1 kill (exceptions include Tether and baby blade... I'm sorry but you're probably getting shotgun/meleed in this meta 😭). On Behemoth or Revenant, 2-4 kills is consistently possible.

Contrast that to if you hold it for that special moment towards the end of the match. Say you miss that super when the moment comes. Now you've done absolutely nothing, there's no time for you to get another one. In Comp, this can turn the tide of the entire game. If you're down 0-3, your team just got supers and you start using them to gain momentum, you can get *another set* by the time you're 3-3. Now you've got 2+ free kills in the game.

**TL;DR: Use your Super when you get it! 1 kill &gt; 0 kills!**",1615848861,2021-03-15 18:54:21

DestinyTheGame,Variable pricing in eververse?,"Do you guys think we’ll ever get it? 

For those of you who don’t know, variable pricing is when the price of something changes to fit someone’s personal allowance 

Lots of mobile games do this, they’ll collect your data, see how often you buy micro transactions, and if you don’t buy many, they often keep lowering the price until they find your specific sweet spot to open the wallet 

For example (a real one that happened to me) was in clash of clans. I never bought anything in that game, it was a mobile game and I didn’t care at all, until I got a ridiculously good offer of a shit ton of gems and some other stuff for like 3$, I was like fuck it whatever it’s 3$, when for other people it could be 10+

From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense.

Now in destiny, I’ll never spend 15$ on an eververse armor set, it just won’t happen. If Bungie could collect and use this data (which they probably have) they’d see that, and sell me a personal limited time offer of the eververse sets being 1/3 off at 10$, okay now maybe I’ll snag one. Get it? 

This allows Bungie to get every player to spend the maximum amount the player is willing to spend on the item. Instead of a blanket 15$ that everyone needs to spend, keep it 15$ for the whales who will always buy it, and individually lower it for people who never do. they’d make more money, and we’d get better deals and Ornaments. Bungie is making 0 dollars off me right now for armor sets, if they individually lowered mine at 10$, they might get me to grab 2 sets. Now multiply that by everybody who also doesn’t buy much

So i am a fairly new player to destiny 2. I played a lot of destiny 1 and enjoyed and now destiny 2 resparked this passion.

However i am really starting to get annoyed by this community. When in destiny 1 someone didnt know a raid oder how to play a nightfall correctly you would just help him and take your time and enjoy the game.

But now i want to play the deep stone crypt and cant because i only played it 2 or 3 times and still dont really now the path in the beginning with the blizzard  and how to play scanner or operator. However i knew the rest.

But when i want to play with people who only want people that KWTD i get kicked out since i dont know neither operator nor the scanner and i dont have the perfect pve weapons and just do 1 million damage to taniks in the first round instead of 1.5. 

Then i told myself well then lets play with people who drag new players through the raid and learn a bit more but i also cant do that since they see i already have it cleared three times and kick me out. 

This happened 5 times today that i got kicked out and will not be able to play the raid this week.

DestinyTheGame,I just “redownload” destiny after after 7 years of not playing it,"Alright so here’s the story, it’s September 9 2014, I’m a college senior who’s loved by bungie since I played halo 2, I just got my paycheck from subway and I decided to treat myself to the newest bungie game, destiny, a large open world adventure that’s Guaranteed to blow your mind, so I go to my local game shop to pick up and I get the last copy on the shelf, I go home and put it in my PS4, I see that the download would take a while so I put it on rest more and start doing other things, meanwhile my father, a former cancer patient, has told me that his cancer is flaring up again, I always had a strong relationship with my father and when he got cancer I was with him the whole time and I was willing to do it again, unfortunately he lived in Indiana, and I lived in Florida, when I got the text I dropped everything, packed for a 2 week long trip and I immediately bought a ticket, when I arrived I stayed by my father and mother’s side until my fathers cancer calmed town, I stayed at the city my mom and dad resided and I really enjoyed it, I eventually came back to my house in south Florida after everything seemed to calm down, when I had come back however it wasn’t time for games and happiness, I had left in a big hurry with a ton of things undecided, first I had my job which I actually able to get back into my job with little or no hassle  (my brother was the manager) after that there was bills to pay, people to meet, and just overall things to do, I eventually got back to my PS4 but I never got on destiny, I had bought uncharted the Nathan drake collection when I was in Indiana and I was eager to play it after playing uncharted 1 and 2 on the ps3. I eventually deleted the game in 2016 Becuase I was selling my first gen PS4 for a new PS4 pro, fast forward a couple years, multiple girlfriends, a lot of jobs and a new house and here we are, a week ago I found the dusty old copy of destiny along with a couple of other games, I put the disk in and waited for it to download, it gave me plenty of enough time to reflect on how I got here and how much it’s been since since I first put the game in, I felt like I was one of the first people to play it, yet I didn’t even start the game, and here we are today a week later with asking you guys what should I expect, I know the game has drastically changed since 2014 so I want to know anything and everything new about it.

DestinyTheGame,Wish ender/key of light and darkness,"So I’m sure this has been brought up before but I can’t find any RECENT discussions on it so here goes. 

I’ve been playing D2 Since launch but have a bad habit of not finishing things until much later. I played through forsaken back in 2018 and unlocked Dreaming City but never got wish ender done. 

A few weeks before Beyond Light released I did the ??? Mission and received the 3 tokens but didn’t feel like running shattered throne at the time. Now, finally, last night I did shattered throne and the 3 bosses and claimed the bow. However, my OCD is acting up as I have a quest for Wish Ender (present this to statue) stuck in my quests tab. I also have a quest Key of Light and Darkness that I’m not sure I need to complete. Any idea if I should just abandon them? Why wouldn’t they be removed if there’s no reason to complete them as 

A) I already have the bow 
B) I’ve already unlocked the dreaming city

DestinyTheGame,A Quick word about the Icefall Mantle,"I love using Icefall Mantle, fun exotic that keeps me in the fray of the fight, but Bungie, please allow users to use the class ability key/button to manually toggle the effect off if they so choose. 

There have been quite a few occasions where I use the ability in the midst of combat, then the room gets wiped, but since every time you receive damage while the effect is active, it resets the time to 20 seconds, AND you cannot sprint or jump while the effect is active (which is fine), I'm stuck walking my slow self over to the next room while my Fireteam members are blazing through the level. It would just be a really nice QoL change to be able to toggle the effect off with another press of the ability key/button. Hopefully other Guardians agree.",1615838820,2021-03-15 16:07:00

DestinyTheGame,Change “combatants” to “enemies of humanity” in perk descriptions,"Bungie uses the term **combatants** in newer item descriptions whenever an item’s perk relates to PVE enemies. However, this term isn’t 100% consistent (as YouTubers such as Fallout Plays have shown in some videos). Sometimes it also works in PVP. It's a term that's too broad and unclear given the many different game modes in *Destiny*.

However, while playing (a lot of) Gambit this past week, I noticed the term used on the loading screen: **enemies of humanity**. This is great and it's a solution that already exists.

For PVP-only perks, what if the perk stated “**against enemy Guardians**” or ""**in the Crucible**""?

And for perks that work across PVP/PVE, how about “**against any enemy**”?

This would clarify some perk descriptions. I mention this because a recent TWAB said some in-game text would be corrected for grammar, and this could be a good change for user experience.

(The D1 term “minions of Darkness” was discontinued in D2. And “PVE/PVP” are jargony terms that understandably aren’t used in-game.)",1615838328,2021-03-15 15:58:48

DestinyTheGame,Adept Weapons from Trials/GM NFs should roll with 2 perks in the final perk column.,"After going Flawless 3x in Trials this weekend just to get 3 badly rolled Messenger's, especially none with Desperado, feels bad.

Putting in **that** much work, just to have a slim chance at the roll you want, feels really bad. There needs to be a differentiator to non-Adept weapons, aside from Adept mods that don't really add much to the weapon IMO. Getting the roll you want should be a little easier and the gun should offer more flexibility with the additional perk slots.

DestinyTheGame,I've also made a C#/.NET wrapper for the Bungie.net API,"It's called ""BungieSharper"" (since BungieSharp was already taken by a wrapper that hasn't been updated since 2016) and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/ashakoor/BungieSharper) and get it on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BungieSharper) or one of the other places listed in the wiki section of the repo [here.](https://github.com/ashakoor/BungieSharper/wiki#getting-started)

I started working on BungieSharper around 2.5 years ago, when I had basically no programming experience, and anything I learned at the time was a direct result of working on it. At the time, it was called ""NetBungieApi"" (not to be confused with "".NetBungieAPI"" posted on the sub by EndGameGl a couple days ago) and I worked on it for about 3-4 months before abandoning all my Destiny-related projects. Came back to it about 9 months ago, renamed it to what it is now, and made a ton of changes to make it publicly usable.

Features:

- Fully asynchronous (where possible) and makes use of `CancellationTokens`
- Uses `System.Net.HttpClient` and `System.Text.Json` so there are 0 dependencies for .NET 5.0, and just `System.Text.Json` v5.0+ for .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Core 3.1.
  - No support for anything earlier, as I make use of nullable reference types from C# 8.0 and don't want to include a billion preprocessor directives to support older versions. And .NET Core 3.0 is EOL, so nobody should use it.
- Built-in rate limiter to keep yourself from hitting the Bungie API too much (officially stated limit is 250requests/10seconds/IP)
- All the Bungie API-specific code is generated by ""BungieSharper.CodeGen"" using the `openapi.json` specification in [their GitHub repo,](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/) so any changes to the API will be trivial to make to BungieSharper.
- Feature-complete (in terms of accessing the API.) `POST` requests are implemented, though I haven't checked them, as I don't have a purpose for them at the moment. `GET` requests and OAuth for ""confidential"" clients are working perfectly for me though.
- Includes all the official documentation in the docstrings, so you get to read about all the ordeals the API team had to go through. And I guess there's also some stuff about using the API in there.

There's some other stuff as well which you can find in the wiki, as this post is getting long enough. I'm open to feedback, questions, concerns, comments, pull requests, issues, etc.

&gt;!Side note: I've been looking for a job for a *while* now, if you or someone you know can help me with that then I will be eternally grateful.!&lt;",1615836716,2021-03-15 15:31:56

DestinyTheGame,Linear fusion rifles,"Let lfr fire a laser for like a second like a trace rifle and let us aim the beam like on fusion rifles. Since they pierce their targets they would be much better at ad clearing, cause you would be able to annihilate all ads in a general direction, instead of relying on rng that all the ads line up perfectly. This would differentiate them from fusions, since fusions fire projectiles that are stuck on the first thing they hit and lfr wouldn't be practically worse sniper rifles because you would get more bang for your buck. On bosses you could rearrange them to do only one crit per entity, but if you are wailing around a boss you could still hit it multiple times, let's just say 3 times, one of the hits could be a crit, the other two would be normal hits. This would make them better at boss damage, but not overpowered if tuned correctly, but more importantly, it would give them some identity.

side note: even having them being intrinsic anti barrier would make them a lot better in pve and would fit in the laser beam theme.

DestinyTheGame,With The New Stasis Subclasses You Should Be Able to Get 3 Even 4 100 Stats,"I was pondering this the other day as I just got 100 Recovery and Discipline on my Warlock so I started doing the math. 

Say you have 4 60 stat total pieces of amor each can have a mod and be masterworked. This equals 82 times 4 for 328 or 3 tier 100s with great rng, then 328+22 for class item giving 350, then 350+50 for amor mods. 400+40 for powerful friends and radiant light then plus 30 for stasis aspects. This is 470, but the chance of having this collectively in 4 stats is crazy low. And even if you did do it you would be limited to the class stats(Mobility,Recovery, and Resilience) and Melee

You could however have 3 100 stats with more variety; 
One would have to be melee 
One would have to be Recovery, Resilience, or Mobility
The last could be any stat not already chosen
Here is the math for it in a more laid out way for an example of 3 stats.


Melee: 60+MW=72+20(Radiant Light)=92+10(Stasis)=102

Recovery: 60+MW=72+10(Stasis)=82+20(Normal Stat Mods)=102

Intellect: 60+MW=72+30(Normal Stat Mods)=102

For those who are curious this is how you could do 4 100 stats(like the example given above) however this would need extremely good rng for the base stats and sadly you are forced to use Melee and the Class stats

Mobility: 60+MW=72+20(Powerful Friends)=92+10(Normal Stat Mod)=100

Recovery: 60+MW=72+10(Stasis)=82+20(Normal Stat Mods)=102

Resilience: 60+MW=72+10(Stasis)=82+20(Normal Stat Mods)=102

Melee: 60+MW=72+20(Radiant Light)=92+10(Stasis)=102

Now I’m sure some of you are saying there’s no way to get 60 in 4 stats without mods, but it’s definitely possible, all you need is at least 15 in those 4 stats with little amounts like 2 or 4 in the others. This is of course is vary to chance as one piece might have 12 and another 18. Amor with those rolls can drop however it’s very rare and is why 4 100 is barely possible. 
However it is definitely possible and I would guarantee that at least one person has the amor to pull this off",1615833159,2021-03-15 14:32:39

DestinyTheGame,Warlock shattering Fragments: quick concepts to let the floof lads &amp; lasses get shattering like the slide apes and dunk Bs,"As many know, Warlocks don't anything alike the slide to shatter or a dunk to shatter, **in terms of shatter, we have no shatter**, they have no stasis shattering capacities beyond their super, they have a no good turret and a ""rift-to-freeze"" that was good with Vesper of Radius for all 2 hours before it was nerfed. But I have a few ideas to make this change for Warlocks. 

1. I would give warlocks a second granade ability, that, when they have one fully charged granade would make the charge rate of the second say half the time, and when there are frozen enemies/stasis cristales nearby, they eat their granade and shatter nearby crystals.

2. Else we could have Double nades but after freezing an enemy the second granade becomes a special shattering granade, though this idea is unfair to other classes because they have to get close to the crystals to shatter them, Warlocks wouldn't have to be close and would make other classes feel like warlocks can play from afar while they need to get up close and personal and that will just land us with another nerf.

3. Other idea I have is just a basic blink, with the caveat that you can only blink (using mobility ability key, same as Icarus and Dive) into a crystal/frozem enemy if you're looking at it (maybe give it a HUD highlight). Blinking will cause shattering of the crystal from the inside, the enemies' tell for Warlocks to do this would be the red marker that stasis give to frozen combatants. If the enemy does not die, the blink will add certain momentum that may or may not thrust them into a wall to their doom. Cooldown is the same as Shatterdive. Note that warlocks won't be able to blink around without crystals around so it won't be something the player can cast on demand like a slide or Shatterdive or Slide, but it has the benefit of providing instantaneous movement and safety from enemy fire for panic uses of a glacial nade and blinking into it. Also if they can do this while in super is up to Bungie devs/sandbox balance team, though I'd let it happen at the beginning and change it afterwards.

4. If none of these sound good, just buff again Vesper of Radius and let us shatter with that.

I wouldn't try to pick names for these, they are up to Bungie as I don't feel I can pick names since Aspects are things that seemingly could be found in the world like a fallen arm, a frozen Cabal turret, a frozen Vex  Conflux but with whacky names. I would however dare to suggest the items, for the grandes it could be a frozen fallen granade and for the blink one a frozen Vex head.",1615831248,2021-03-15 14:00:48
DestinyTheGame,Warmind Cell Guide,"Fallout Plays did a really clear and comprehensive guide to Warmind Cells a few weeks ago.  With Rage of Rasputin having finally shown up, it's worth understanding the exact mechanics.

[https://youtu.be/OTVJhlHxa8w?t=163](https://youtu.be/OTVJhlHxa8w?t=163)

&amp;#x200B;

Some key points:

* The effect when YOU shoot a warmind cell depends on the mods YOU have equipped.  If YOU don't have warmind mods, **do not shoot warmind cells**.
* Warmind cells spawn every 5 'eligible kills'.  Eligible kills are 1) killing blows with a Seventh Seraph/Ikelos weapon, 2) killing blows from another weapon (witherhoard, telesto) if you have your Seventh Sereph/Ikelos weapon equipped at the time the target dies, or 3) killing blows from solar splash damage, if you have Wrath of Rasputin mod slotted

DestinyTheGame,Cohesion problems with stats and nomenclature,"Destiny seems to have big issues with sticking to a nomenclature for buffs/debuffs/triggers/stats. It is very frustrating to have ""combatants"" mean PvE only on one item, PvP AND PvE on another. Especially when the definition changes without patch notes, see Surprise Attack that used to be a 100% buff in PvE only, was suddenly turned into a 35% damage buff that works both in PvE and PvP with no indication or text change.

Range means a lot of different things depending on the weapon, it used to reduce spread on shotguns, now it doesn't, precision frame shotguns have a vastly higher range stat compared to aggressive but don't have any longer effective range in practise, some weapons have capped range some doesn't etc.

For as simple as Destiny is compared to a lot of ARPG/Looter shooter games in terms of available modifiers/stats it is also one of the most opaque and full of absolute nonsense descriptions.

It would be really nice to see this being tackled in the future, someone at Bungie needs to sit down and have a look at all the text. What is Combatant supposed to mean, why was ""takedown"" introduced instead of using kill, what exactly is the definition of minor/major/boss. (champions seems to sometimes be bosses, sometimes majors for the weapon mod damage) etc.",1615830159,2021-03-15 13:42:39

DestinyTheGame,Forget whether you think win trading is a problem or not. This weekend showed me something I never really considered,"So, hate me if you want, but my team who I run Trials with decided to go the Hakker method due to a variety of reasons, but that doesn't really matter. While we were going through it, adding other Guardians, rolling, and shooting the shit while they/we change characters, we were legitimately having fun and it dawned upon me. Social interaction in-game is pretty much nonexistent .

The only times I really interact with fellow Guardians is through third parties like the various Destiny subreddits or LFG. Majority of the time I've sought out teams to raid with and so on, I've honestly had a blast, but now that my friends have all gotten back into the game recently, I've gone back into almost zero interaction mode with the community save for the random times that a big chonky Titan decides to come give me a hug in the Tower.

This so called ""MMO"" really needs some systems in place that encourages and enables some real interaction with other Guardians. Be it an in game LFG system, maybe trading if they could somehow figure that out and balance it, or perhaps some large scale activities where there is a big group of Guardians at your back.

DestinyTheGame,Bungie said in TWAB a couple of weeks back that they will adjust drop rates for things like Bottom Dollar this season. When is that happening?,[removed],1615828960,2021-03-15 13:22:40
DestinyTheGame,"No, 12-man raids shouldn't be permenant feature.","There, I said it. It shouldn't be a permenant feature, because it would ruin the reason why we raid, the challenge. Raids are fun, because they are challenging, taking the challenge away and it's not fun. Also if the game added 12-man raids, Bungie would need to design raids around that number of players while also designing it around 6-man teams, it would be a complete design failure and it would take forever for a new raid to come out!",1615828838,2021-03-15 13:20:38
DestinyTheGame,New Player: Inability to get certain mods make me sad :(,"It's just very depressing to be a newish player and look at all these videos about cool builds and then find out that you don't have the mods and don't have a way to get them. I started late November 2020 and have about 500 hours by now, and I've got most things I need to be successful, but I'll forever be behind my teammates on Atrax damage because Banshee won't sell Lucent Blade. I also really want Protective Light and Powerful Friends, but alas. I've been checking the mods sales daily since January when I first understood the problem, and I finally have all the normal, non-combat-style mods (I didn't get auto rifle reserves until the very end which was annoying when trying to run Divinity for Taniks), and I thought that maybe turning in gunsmith mats would start getting me random combat style mods, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Anyways Bungie, I feel like you've done a decent job at making new players not feel left out, but this one kind of stings because of the impossibility. I'm about to be away from my computer for a few weeks, and I'm terrified that one of the ones I need will be on offer and I'll miss my chance for the next year. I'm probably going to resort to giving my login info to someone else which is not a great solution but it's all I got -\_-

tl;dr I'd love to be able to grind literally any activity for just a chance at more mods until I have them all",1615828828,2021-03-15 13:20:28

DestinyTheGame,Should I reset my infamy in hopes of Bungie adding the weapons to the engrams?,"I don’t know how, but I went from Legend all the way back to Legend this week and I’m not sure if I should reset just in case they add the weapons to Drifter.

DestinyTheGame,Could we get drop percentages in the collections tab not just the location of the drop,"For example, the Trials sparrow says there's a chance of this dropping at the flawless chest.... what chance specifically?

I'm asking this as I'm chasing the the ship, The Fourth Mark, from the Coup De Grace mission. Must have done this over 100 times since release.... still nothing!

DestinyTheGame,DCV is Good and Bad,"It always amazes me how upset people get over this DCV thing. Bungie has placed content into it exactly ONE time, yet everyone seems to be really mad and acting like they removed content multiple times. The majority of the content placed in there I, and I would even say most, barely touched or played it. Sure there are exceptions, but I think it's much healthier for them and Bungie's employees to work this way. This allows them to focus on bring bigger and better new content. Instead of always needed to balance and test older content.  

If we get more content similar to how this current season is current going, I'm all for them placing older content in the DCV and continuing to evolve the story and setting. 

Also, think about how much time you have invested in Destiny over the years. For \~40$ a year, plus 10$ seasons if you want,  most players have logged dozens and hundreds of hours each year. I really can only think of a handful of games that I keep going back to each year. Most I spend the 60$ and beat it. Maybe play some extra side stuff, but really never go back to it. The DCV is, in a way, a similar concept. You play the new content a bunch, then years later never really touch it anymore because you have moved on to the new content. EA makes people  pay 60$ each year for the same sports game with just new name and stats on players. 

Maybe I'm in the minority, but I am perfectly fine with content going into the DCV after a couple of years. For \~40$ a year, Destiny really is not that much money. Plus, if you don't enjoy it anymore, there are millions of other games to play. Destiny will always be here with new content if you want to come back. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Remember, D2 basically was Bungie placing D1 in the DCV after three years. But I don't remember people complaining about that one. Sure you can technically go back and play everything, but how many people REALLY touched D1 after D2 released?",1615828361,2021-03-15 13:12:41
DestinyTheGame,My ideas to help fix Gambit.,"These probably aren't that great but it's just some of things my clan has been discussing after chasing the In it for Infamy challenge.

1. No invasions when your team is leading by 20 motes. One of the most common steamrolling tactics is  a bunch of large blockers and then immediate invasion. This makes it so that the enemy team is unable to bank, and has to deal with an invader before they can even get their feet wet. Nothing feels worse than a prime up with less than 20 motes on your side. 

2. No melt bosses. Immune phases aren't that fun, but Gambit primes way of doing DPS felt way more rewarding and actually had time in between DPS to effectively invade. There are too many matches where the enemy team is absolutely melting their prime before a teammate can even get a clear shot on them after invading.

2.5. The servitor boss is a slap in the face to those for and against immune phases. The boss is terrible. It's the only one with a mechanic and because of that I'd prefer the others way more. I do not enjoy readying a slova and firing just for a teammate to hit it once with a Handcannon and a knock off taken goblin to appear.

3. More maps. Bring back the old, and in with some new. I would not hate getting absolutely destroyed if I could be destroyed on Europa, the Moon, the Cosmodrome, Io, Mercury(both possible because of Deep Six and New Arcadia).

4. Better ammo distribution. No more heavy ammo wall things. Invaders have a 100% chance to spawn heavy and special when killed. Small blockers have a 50% chance to spawn special. Mediums have a 90% of special and a 30% chance of heavy. Large have a 100% special and 60% heavy. This will further encourage teammates to take out blockers for a chance of some heavy or special, and kill Invaders to help their teammates with added reward of getting some heavy and special.

5. Invaders should need to deal the killing blow. If a invader so much as touches me dealing 1 damage and then I get killed by enemies before regenerating that counts as an invader kill and heals the prime. 

6. Weekly/Daily Modifiers. This is just a fun one to add more variety. Maybe have stuff like grenadier, brawler, and arc singe appear. 

7. Reissue the Gambit(excluding Trust, Bygones and Bad Omens, but update their power cap)(and maybe prime) weapons to drop from matches with perk pools that have as Trinary System and Bottom dollar. You have a 100% chance of getting a Gambit weapon per game, and can get a maximum of 3 per match. 

7.5 Gamblers Umbral. Umbral engram that has all available Gambit weapons in it. Has 6 similar engrams.

Row2:

Gambler's Energy: Trinary System, Bottom Dollar, Distant Relation, and Crowd Pleaser.

Gambler's Kinetic: Dreaded Venture, Parcel of Stardust, Hazard of the Cast, Pillager.

Row3:

Gambler's Precison: Dreaded Venture, Distant Relation

Gambler's Chosen: Bottom Dollar, Trinary System.

Gambler's Abuse: Pillager, Crowd Pleaser

Gambler's Knockout: Parcel of Stardust, Hazard of the Cast.

Gambit matches now grant Risky Token. Risky Tokens work similar to Hammer Charges. Row1 requires 1 Token. Row2 requires 3 just kidding that would be insane😐. Row2 requires 2. And Row 3 requires 3. Winning a Gambit match grants 2-3. Losing grants 0-1. I don't want to have a Gambit loss grant 0, but many people in this game are getting rewarded to disadvantaging their teammates by throwing. The 0-1 amount let's those who loss a chance at a Token, and Lazy people a chance at nothing. Drifter also sells upgrades that cost 5-15 Risky Tokens. Stuff like Gambit Matches have a higher chance to drop Umbrals, or can drop a random Gambit Umbral engram.

These are all probably very bad, and a lot of people will tell me that, but I wanted to share some things I have talked about with my clan that might help improve Gambit.


TL;DR: Gambit?

Also how do you make stuff bold and big on mobile.",1615828284,2021-03-15 13:11:24
DestinyTheGame,Adept weapons have so much wasted potential right now. Here is how to make them appealing,"Im taking the shadow price as an example, but really you can use the same arguments for any adept weapon.

Adept weapons are (or should be) hard to earn via endgame content like trials of Osiris, GM nightfalls or master raids in the future.

So because of that i feel like they should standout way more than their non adept counterparts.

First of all they should roll entirely different perks than the normal versions and second Bottomless Grief and Celerity should be made intrinsic on adept weapons. Also instead of barrel options id love to have them come with scopes instead

I feel like the old pinnacle weapons did a great job of introducing new interesting perks, but i also think that it was a mistake of not just making them pinnacle perks. 

So imagine the adept shadow price could roll with onslaught (Breakneck perk) and Meganeura (oxygen sr perk) or maybe even despacito. 

This would be a weapon i would want to grind a godroll for. It really would be a incentive to get into the endgame.

But as of right now adept weapons are just lazy reskins with an ugly shader and slightly better stats.

I will probably run a few gm Nightfalls but there is no chance im grinding for a godroll, its just not worth it.

And im not even talking about trials which is by far the most unfun experience i had in any game ever.

I generally like pvp and id wish their would be adept weapons for 6v6 gamemodes as well.

So here it is Papa joe, the solution on how to make adept weapons appealing, entirely for free.

Feel free to use it.",1615828256,2021-03-15 13:10:56
DestinyTheGame,Buff Well of Radiance (in PvP only),"Dear Bungie,

&amp;#x200B;

Well of Radiance was already a less-than-average subclass before Beyond Light, and it was quickly thrown to the side when Stasis came out. Now, I can't even stay alive in the super without getting completely rolled by a single Stasis ability. I'm a firm believer in making every subclass viable. However, I'm not saying you should make the super immune to the Stasis supers, but at least make the super somewhat immune to slow-afflicting Stasis abilities. Possibly like giving Well of Radiance a Shelter from the Storm effect that only makes you immune to Slow stacks and not like full freezing from a Stasis super, Glacial grenade, or Coldsnap. That's the only buff I actually want for Well of Radiance. I really just want to use my favorite subclass again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

WHY DOESN'T THE WELL OF RADIANCE SLAM ONE-SHOT PEOPLE? It only does 150 impact damage and you have to literally be inside of someone to do full damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

angry well of radiance warlock",1615828160,2021-03-15 13:09:20

But the reality is because the weapon is just too good at everything. And instead of nerfing it which is the worst thing to do to exotics. Just ban it. 

And here’s my case for why:
1. it’s literally a 1000% upgrade from Truth which is already great. 
2. it’s great at invading. Only got one rocket. No worries, you can still lock the entire team with one rocket. 
3. it’s great at defending. Someone pops over. You get a quick lock and fire, doesn’t matter if you trade they’re dead. 
— plus in defending a 1 for 1 trade is great. 
4. It’s great for killing the boss. 

That’s 3 roles of Gambit. 
I said earlier that I would rather it be banned than locked bc it’s always awful to nerf exotics. The only nerf I could recommend is a longer time to lock and still idk if that would fix it.",1615827644,2021-03-15 13:00:44

I can actually look up the eververse weekly planning knowing I'll have enough dust for basically everything I want. And I can work towards getting a big 4k dust package (that's almost a full armor set !) by working out all the challenges.

You could run whatever primary and secondary of your choice. Or go crazy and run a shotgun, machine gun and sword.",1615826870,2021-03-15 12:47:50
DestinyTheGame,The post about warlock subclasses being bad is more about stasis being the naturally better option than the other subclasses being bad.,"I feel like you could make similar arguments about hunters and titans in a similar way.

* ""Silence and Squall is a better Blade Barrage""
* ""Burning Maul is barely used in PVP""
* ""Behemoth is a better Striker""
* ""Bottom-tree tether is non-existent in PVP""
* ""You can *outrun* an Arc Staff""

The use of subclasses before Beyond Light was definitely more evenly split than it is right now. Now a large portion of the community defaults into the stasis subclasses, but this isn't because the non-stasis ones are bad (even though some are in need of help). 

Stasis is just the *better* option for the average player. Stasis is just a natural counter to any super which involves getting into close quarters because a freeze/slow will negate your ability to close the gap and, more often than not, lead to you dying.
-
While there are definitely non-stasis subclasses in the current sandbox that I can see being used, Chaos Reach's former ability to get **3-6** supers per game was definitely going to be nerfed.",1615826575,2021-03-15 12:42:55

DestinyTheGame,How does thresh compare to bad juju?,"One of my favorite builds is a bottom tree solar hunter with that bird helm that turns your golden gun into a single shot. Max intelligence coupled with that passive that gives you super energy for headshots means I can take champions out with ease almost always having my super when we get to one.

I have been using bad juju to boost the super gain, but im wondering how my bottom dollar with thresh compares with the juju perk. I'm making these numbers up, but if juju kills give 10% super energy per kill and thresh gives 5%, ill stick with juju. If it's something like 10% juju and 7% thresh, I'll never use the bad juju again.

Oh. And Bunjie, the studio that got me started playing games (besides Miyamoto) made this fucking masterpiece??

Goodbye productivity.

DestinyTheGame,A couple suggestions to make grinding less frustrating (I'd also like to know your suggestions),"I feel like a lot of the frustrations regarding loot (especially with weapons like bottom dollar) stem from people not knowing when or even *if* they'll get one. It can be very discouraging playing a game mode you'd rather not play with no guarantee that you'll ever get what you're after (I happen to love gambit so this is a suggestion not me venting frustration). I can't be the first person to suggest something like this, but I feel like a token system would alleviate a lot of the frustration. You run a legendary lost sector and don't get your exotic, you get a token. After a certain number of tokens, you can exchange them for the exotic. Even a 20 token requirement would at least make it feel like you're not wasting your time. Hopefully you get it before 20 runs, but at least not getting it would still feel like progress. In addition or if bungie is firmly against a token system, you should get bottom dollar when you reset rank. I really liked that weapons like trust were rewards for ranking up. 

People just need to know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel because the thought of ""I've run 20 gambits and have gotten nothing, do I really want to run another 20 more and still not get the weapon?"" makes it feel like you're wasting your time. I know I'm talking about gambit a lot, but this could be applied to all game modes. Grinding raids for spoils of conquests so you can purchase anarchy is a far more enjoyable experience than praying rngesus blesses you with eyes of tomorrow. 

Another thing that might be worth looking into is to use something like Diablo 3's mercy timer. In Diablo 3, the longer you go without getting a legendary, the more of a chance you have to find one. 

At the end of the day, I play video games. I don't design them. I have almost no knowledge of video game development so these are merely uneducated suggestions. I'm not saying that destiny should just hand out new God weapons because they need to incentivize people to keep playing these different modes. That said this game is about grinding to get multiple versions until you get the perks that fit your play style. It's rarely an ""I got the weapon I was after now I'm done"".  I'm curious to hear how you guys and girls think bungie can make the grind feel more rewarding and less frustrating.",1615824957,2021-03-15 12:15:57

DestinyTheGame,Stasis Legendary Weapons,"Let me preface this by saying I do not know what Bungie are planning to do with Stasis weapons. This is purely a speculative opinion I have and an idea to maybe make the burns on weapons be more than something used to remove enemy shields.

So, there's a few people who think that when Stasis legendary weapons arrive they'll have some special ability that might freeze or slow targets. While that sounds okay, here's why I believe it won't happen.

Solar, Void and Arc legendary weapons have no special effects aside from taking down a shield that matches it's type. More than likely we'll just get a bunch of Stasis weapons and a few enemies will now start displaying Stasis shields.

Now, if they do get a special ability like slowing or freezing enemies. Then that would mean that the original three weapon types will fall behind and likely not want to be used and rather forced to be used just to get rid of shield types. So I was thinking if Stasis does have one of these effects it would be cool to see the original weapons get updated.

\- Solar could leave a small lingering burn effect, like damage over time. But not last as long as say abilities or exotic weapons as to not make them obsolete.

\- Arc could essentially become like a arc web effect but only chain to one other enemy, again as to not take away from exotics and abilities that specialise in that. E.g: Riskrunner or Warlock's Arc Web.

\- Void could suppress enemies, maybe not slow them but make them more susceptible to damge.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said; they could end up just being like all the other legendary weapons we have and do nothing special besides just be another source of weaponry that we use primarily to take down shields. While it'd be cool to have them expand on the actual elemental burns, part of me thinks that won't happen any time soon if at all.

If you look at the Dead Orbit tent and (don't quote me on this one) the Future War Cult box, you can see that they've changed colors. The Dead Orbit tent is lacking the green from before, and I think that Future War Cult no longer has that bright shade of blue.

I'm a titan, just got past the soft cap, looking to slow down and level in a bit with some armor.

When destiny 2 first started the different worlds had different armor sets with different base stats.

As a titan I can assume now I should be going after armor that is resilient and recovery as a ""base boost.""

I see u can modify, level up and such the gear in general, but after googling for an hour I still can't figure out if there Is some info on farming simple legendary armor with a titan resilient/recovery base Stat installed boost.

Energy level 1 would be fine, I'm not looking for a 2300 hard cap final build just looking to farm a matching titan-ish starting stat set, then upgrade it a bit and keep playing. 

Im assuming all gear now doesn't start out with the same base stats???? If thats the case I can mix/match grab any set and start adjusting.

You pick up a TV series , You watch the first 2 as they were coming out and they were good but they were a few bad episodes that had promise so you decided to not watch the next season or 2 live no biggie you will just catch up/rewatch before watching the newer episodes... Ohhh an episode here and there were taken out.

(This is when destiny 2 started pushing FOMO)

You cant rewatch every episode to get up to date/enjoy the show no biggie they must have been bad/not important to the overall story....

You watch what you can and you are finally are up to date, the new series (5) is out tomorrow and your mostly caught up.  you are excited to continue watching and immersing yourself in this world that was built.

Ohhhhhhhh.... a few more episodes have been removed here and there from seasons 1-5.

You are enjoying the show for the next few seasons , you stop watching live here and there for a few seasons and miss out on a couple of episodes that were good to watch and see have more context what's happening but Oh well.

OH your new to the tv series no worries, here is season 9-12 the new season 13 will be out soon.

DestinyTheGame,Maybe it's just me but looking back on content I feel like Oryx was the last time I felt there was an actual threat in Destiny that felt so rewarding to defeat,"And allow me to elaborate more on that before passing judgement. Ghaul was a bigger threat. I mean it was the first time we were ever lightless. However, tying up the story in the main story line and leaving us with the Leviathan as a raid really shortened that feeling of ""danger."" Calus was hardly a threat and actually provided us with rewards. The Taken King expansion drew out the plot a lot longer and tied it all up with the King's Fall raid. Seeing how huge Oryx was during the raid and actually having a challenge to defeat the main threat at the time was so much more satisfying. Not to mention, in my opinion, the dreadnaught was one of my favorite destinations in destiny history and very elaborate with quite a few secrets and things to do. Plus watching victims get ""taken"" by being sucked into a black hole was pretty threatening.

Fast forward to more recent events; the pyramids/darkness were ominous and creepy last season, taking over our ghost and speaking through them, the floating bodies everywhere. It's been the backstory of all of destiny, the ""darkness chasing the light."" Then it arrives and... Gives us its power? And Taniks? What's he gonna do? He was snow-covered lying under a pile of scrap. I throughly enjoy the DSC raid, don't get me wrong. I just don't really feel like in the Destiny universe it compares to defeating Oryx and that nothing has really come close to giving me that feeling of a drawn out accomplishment that means as much.",1615820650,2021-03-15 11:04:10

The mod provides special ammo on every yellow health bar enemy you make a finisher on and heavy ammo on every ´mini bosses´, which you can find more or less on each side you have to go and also the Knight-Blocker.

The best part about this that no one else have to run the Aeon but there are some great bonus you can get by more people using them ofcourse.

DestinyTheGame,Exotic Weapon Buff Suggestions(S13 version),"There are quite a number of Exotics that are just outright underperforming lately, and some that need either minor changes or major changes to just be more usable. I didn't include Eyes of Tomorrow as it's 'bugged', and I also didn't include The Queenbreaker and Sleeper Simulant as their issues are rooted in the fact that Linear Fusions are just... BAD. Anyway, these are my suggestions...

**Rat King**  
Rat Pack: Increase the max distance you can be away from fireteam members using Rat King to receive the bonus from this perk by 1.5x

Rat Pack: Perk bonus multiplier varies based on max fireteam member count. Ex: Max fireteam count being 3 players would result in receiving x2 from an ally rather than x1.

Goal: Rat King currently requires a very tight knit team to take advantage of it's Exotic perk. This causes it to be a very poor option for many activities such as Raids where players typically split off from each other. It's also very underwhelming in activities with a low player cap such as Strikes and Dungeons.

**MIDA Multi-Tool**  
Catalyst: Replace Outlaw with Killing Wind.

Goal: MIDA Multi-Tool already has a very high reload speed, and Outlaw feels like a very unworthy and wasted increase in power from a Catalyst that is quite rare and difficult to complete. Killing Wind would appeal more to the speed fantasy that MIDA has without making it too powerful.

**Malfeasance**  
Explosive Shadow: Reduced amount of bullets to activate the perk from 5 to 4.

Goal: Malfeasance is quite an underwhelming Exotic all around. With it's recent 33% mag size buff increasing it's total ammo count in a magazine to 20, this is the perfect opportunity to make the gun better by reducing the number of shots to activate Explosive Shadow from 5 down to 4. This doesn't change overall damage numbers at all, but it does give it better DPS and a much more valuable and usable niche in both PvE/PvP.

**The Last Word**  
Fan-Fire: Remove penalties of firing from the hip, similar to Dead Man's Tale's catalyst.

General: Controller aim assist reduced to compensate.

Goal: The Last Word feels impeccable on controller, but on MKB it still feels very, very bad. The goal here is to make the weapon feel good while firing from the hip for PC players, while also reeling it in a bit for console, as to not make it overpowered there.

**Coldheart**  
Cold Fusion: Now increases stability and weapon handling the longer the trigger is held down.

General: Damage increased by 20% in PvE.(Also applies to Ruinous Effigy, Prometheus Lens, and Wavesplitter)

Goal: Coldheart suffers because it's intrinsic perk is simply that it's a Trace Rifle, which is redundant now that we have many Trace Rifles in the game now. Trace Rifles are also behind in terms of damage compared to every Special weapon in the game(maybe barring Fusion Rifles, I'm not too sure though) rendering them entirely irrelevant outside of Divinity, so a 20% damage buff should help them compete.

**Graviton Lance**  
Cosmology: Increased the damage of the void orbs by 15%.

General: Damage increased against Minor and Major enemies by 10%.

Goal: Graviton Lance currently falls short compared to many primary Exotics that excel in mass combatant clearing. It's outclassed by Huckleberry and Sunshot in short-mid range, and the bows at longer ranges. These damage increases should help it be a more competitive option in PvE.

**Hard Light**  
Volatile Light: Reverted the nerf that removed no damage fall off from the weapon.

Goal: Hard Light was a clear outlier when Adaptive frame Auto Rifles received a damage buff in Season 10, it was nerfed about a month and a half later, and rightfully so. However, that didn't solve the problems of Adaptives being overly strong. Skip forward to Season 12 and Adaptive Auto Rifles had their damage reeled in, lowering their optimal TTK, yet Hard Light received *no* compensation buffs for this. As a result, it's currently effectively worse than it was prior to Season 10. I believe reverting this part of the nerf to the weapon should be enough to make it a bit more viable again.

**Tarrabah**  
Ravenous Beast: No longer immediately loses progress on Ravenous Beast when stowed, and instead will slowly drain it until the weapon is drawn again. Progress drains faster in PvP and slower in PvE.

Goal: Tarrabah is held back greatly by it's own mechanic, as it forces you to essentially only use the weapon if you want to take advantage of it at all. This creates very bad gunplay, as the game revolves around swapping between your three weapon slots. Making this change should help relieve that problem without making the weapon a bit overtuned.

**Ruinous Effigy**  
Literally just revert the nerfs, don't need a 'Goals' section here. The changes were unwarranted and turned a fun and decent gun into a mediocre and underwhelming gun.

**Legend of Acrius**  
General: Moved to the Energy slot and requires Special ammo to use.

General: Damage reduced in PvP to reduce lethality as compensation.

Goal: Legend of Acrius is currently... well... just not good. It deals similar damage to that of Slug Shotguns, yet it has less ammo, slower damage output, and awful handling. Overall the weapon is pretty bad in the heavy slot, however, simply putting it in the special slot could help make the gun strong once more.

**D.A.R.C.I.**  
General: Moved to the Energy slot and requires Special ammo to use.

General: Damage increased by 10% in PvE.(Also applies to Whisper of the Worm, Cloudstrike, and Borealis)

Goal: Similar to Legend of Acrius, this weapon is extremely underwhelming right now. Not only does it do similar, if not worse, damage numbers to special ammo weapons, but in PvP it is abysmal due to the nerfs to it's Archetype and no longer kills in two body shots. Moving it to the special slot could help make the gun a better option.

**Worldline Zero**  
Tesseract: No longer requires sprinting to activate and is the normal power swing.

Goal: Worldline has really just functioned as a 'mobility' enhancer, which for an Exotic is... well, look at MIDA Multi-Tool. Making this simple change would help Worldline stand a chance in PvE content for DPS for once. Sprinting to charge it after waiting for your Sword Energy to recharge just feels tedious. The other swords require minimal effort for their power/special attacks. The Lament simply requires you to block, and the rest just require you to hit the power attack button.

**One Thousand Voices**  
Unforeseen Repercussions: When directly hitting a target with the beam from this weapon, the delayed explosions will now stick to enemies rather than where the beam impacted.

General: Damage increased by 10%

Goal: One Thousand Voices has decent burst damage but is held back by low mag size, and a slower charge time. Increasing it's damage slightly should help it be a contender in endgame activities. The first change should also help consistency. I've had many times where the target I'm trying to damage with it simply takes minimal damage because they move fast enough to escape where the impact of the weapon's beam was.

**Black Talon**  
Catalyst: Reversal now ignores the damage reduction on power attacks when sword energy isn't full. Time to take advantage of Reversal increased to 2 seconds.

Goal: The catalyst for this sword has been effectively useless since the Sword changes in S10. This simply fixes that.

**Leviathan's Breath**  
Draw Time: Reduced from 1328 to 1028.

General: Now takes advantage of Bow Reserves when catalyst is applied. Increases ammo count from 15 &gt; 18.

Goal: Leviathan's Breath has sucked since S8 and will continue to suck until either it's draw time is reduced or it's damage is increased. I think it does plenty damage per shot, but the draw time needs to be lowered. The second bit just allows it to actually take advantage of armor mods, which it should be able to in general.

**Salvation's Grip**  
Cryocannon: Stasis crystal formation from firing the weapon now creates a circular formation of 5 crystals when fully charged rather than a small inconsistent cluster of crystals.

Goal: Just to make this weapon feel a bit less gimmicky? Fully charging a shot should feel good, right now it feels worse than the Glacier Grenade.",1615817692,2021-03-15 10:14:52
DestinyTheGame,Astral horizon should either just have quickdraw removed or better yet put it back in the loot pool,"Removing it from the loot pool was the worst way to handle this, in my opinion quickdraw should either just be nerfed or just added back to astral horizon because currently the one from a few seasons ago is leaps and bounds ahead of the wish.com version we have this season, no one wants pulse monitor or lead from gold when there are people running around with quickdraw or even slideshot, which is so much better than the gross perk pool astral has now, so to sum up I would personally like the old perk pool back but nerfing quickdraw would suffice.

DestinyTheGame,I entered a 12 Player Garden of Salvation Raid and finished 9 hours later with only 1 other original fireteam member,"A friend and I have been trying to get Divinity for a while and figured with 12 player raids active, this was our best shot. We were very wrong. We entered a 12 man raid at 7pm last night. Very few people knew how to do the raid, but we figured with 12 people and some guides we could figure it out. I disconnected an hour into the run and obviously couldn’t reconnect because it was a 12 player fireteam. I figured that was it for me and turned off the game. Fast forward to midnight. My friend texts me. They’re at the boss encounter and have dropped to 5 players. I rejoin because I heard I can still get Divinty as long as it’s the same raid instance. Multiple people quit and are replaced over and over again. Three hours later and even my friend quits (understandable, he’s been going for 8 hours at this point). Now, it’s just me, one other original fireteam member, and an lfg player we picked up along the way who was kind enough to coach us on the encounter. At this point we’re running out of patience, but the last two of us don’t want all our time to have been a waste. The third player fills the last three spots with some of his clan mates and we knock the boss out in two attempts. I got Divinity. 2/12 members of the original fireteam finished the raid and got Divinity.

Don’t read it),"I’m gonna be honest, no one should be ok with having the content they paid for be taken away. What happened, was a transaction. You cannot take that away from us, something we bought from you, bungie. What other games actually do this? And don’t give me some bullshit excuse to take away content like this bungie. I don’t see other developers handling their game’s technical issues that result from much larger file sizes than y’all’s doing this. With bungie’s size as a company becoming larger and larger, there should be enough manpower to tackle these technical issues. The narrative reasons are bullshit too. You say destiny is an evolving game, but that doesn’t warrant taking out content. How are new destiny players going to understand that current narrative when they don’t have context? How are they supposed to know that the crow was once prince uldren, the one who killed cayde, when they can’t play forsaken once it’s vaulted in the future? The narrative is basically “you had to be there” now. There’s no way new players can get invested into y’all’s universe and the characters in it like this. When all my friends heard about content vaulting when playing season of arrivals, they all basically dropped the game once beyond light dropped because of it, and it hurt. Alright Reddit I’m done. Flame me.",1615816838,2021-03-15 10:00:38
DestinyTheGame,I hope Bungie is applying some lessons learned with respect to stasis in advance of the Witch Queen,"Just some thoughts here.  We're now &gt;4 months past the launch of Beyond Light, and we're still receiving large balance patches.  While subclasses often get minor updates and changes throughout the life of the game, what we're seeing with stasis is largely unprecedented.

I'm no software engineer or industry PM, but this kind of work costs time and money.  How many devs are focused on this, that could be focused on the Witch Queen or other projects?  It's important they get it right this fall/winter, because that will enable them to expend resources elsewhere and prioritize better.

Don't get me wrong - I love this game, but I'd like to see the next subclass/element arrive in a more balanced state.  It's hard to understand why it was so imbalanced, but I understand COVID-19 probably played a role.

I hear people discussing public test servers a lot...I'm not sure how well that would work in a narrative driven game, but some more deliberate testing and balancing needs to happen at a minimum.  Things like this suck up too many resources, and impact the rest of the game, whether or not we see it.  How many projects have been delayed or cancelled due to a lack of resources?  We'll never know.",1615816687,2021-03-15 09:58:07
DestinyTheGame,"Despite PVP Balance issues, Stasis integrates lore and gameplay very well","When Stasis first was revealed to be an ice/freezing based subclass, I was skeptical as to how exactly this was supposed to reflect the Darkness. It was black-blue ice, sure, but I couldnt help but feel a bit disappointed that it wasnt something more aesthetically linked to my mental image of ""Darkness"".

&amp;#x200B;

However, now that Beyond Light has been out for months and weve gotten our hands on the subclass, I realize that its so much more than just ""ice"", and Im pretty happy with what Bungie has crafted. It actually integrates many themes associated with the Darkness in the lore and story with the way it behaves during gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

*  The Darkness as the anchor to the Light

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Knife had a million blades.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you were giant, powerful and swift. But the Knife pinned you. Cut your godly flesh away.

Taken from ""Ghost Fragment: The Traveler 3

&amp;#x200B;

The lore piece above is from the ""Dreams of Alpha Lupi"" series from Destiny 1, which are written from the Traaveler´s point of view. The specific fragment I linked describes the battle between the Traveler and the Pyramid Ships during the Collapse.

The Traveler describes being ""pinned"" before being cut away and wounded.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as basically every pvp player has learned since Beyond Light, what does it feel to be frozen by Stasis?

Youre pinned in place. Frozen, but conscious. You see the person who will kill you begin to shoot you and your health begins to slowly tick. Or its a Hunter and you see them jump, bracing for the inevitable Shatterdive. Or its a Titan and you see them slide toward you.

You can try and break free. The button promp is there. Most of the time it is futile however, and you just die.

You feel helpless. Like the Traveler battling the Pyramids.

&amp;#x200B;

Or how Supers can be frozen by Stasis and sometimes defeated afterward. Something that just feels fundamentally *wrong.* 

But read the lore piece again. 

""You were giant, powerful and swift. But the Knife pinned you. Cut your godly flesh away.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is a gameplay flavor win. The Darkness is the only thing that can shut down the Light in such an absolute way. Take the power fantasy of a Guardian and stop it dead in its tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Darkness as a force of control and order in contrast to the Light as a force of chaos and possibility

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The gardener got up and brushed their knees. ""Every game we play, this one pattern consumes all the others. Wipes out every interesting development. A stupid, boring exploit that cuts off entire possibility spaces from ever arising. There's so much that we'll never get to see because of this… pest.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;They chewed at their cracked lip, which existed only because this is an allegory. ""I'm going to do something about it,"" they said. ""We need a new rule.""

Taken from ""The Final Shape"", from the Unveiling lore book.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;All you will do, I said, with rising panic|fury, is delay the dominant pattern that will overrun the others. It is inevitable. One final shape.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""No, it'll be different. Everything will be different, everywhere you look.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Everything will be the same. Your new rule will only make great false cysts of horror full of things that should not exist that cannot withstand existence that will suffer and scream as their rich blisters fill with effluent and rot around them, and when they pop they will blight the whole garden. Whatever exists because it must exist and because it permits no other way of existence has the absolute claim to existence. That is the only law.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""No,"" the gardener said, ""I am the growth and preservation of complexity. I will make myself into a law in the game.""

Taken from ""The First Knife"", from the Unveiling lore book.

&amp;#x200B;

The fundamental difference, and conflict, between the Light and the Darkness is one between simplicty and complexity.

The Winnower, entity behind the Darkness, believes in the order of the original proto universe that was the Garden. Where only one possiblity, one pattern, managed to thrive at the expense of all other possibilities. The Winnower believes that the universe, and all life within it, are heading toward one single conclusion. One single species to survive among a graveyard of trillions, because only one pattern can make it there.

&amp;#x200B;

The Gardener, entity behind the Light, believes in the chaos of life given opportunity. The many possibilties and branching paths the game can explore if it is simply let to do so. The freedom of life to grow in whatever way it pleases and chooses, rather than be forced down a single path because it is simply the most dominant.

&amp;#x200B;

Two opposite ideologies.

&amp;#x200B;

So it makes sense then, that every single Light subclass so far is based on doing raw damage or clearing adds with roaming supers, while Stasis is designed to do one thing extremely well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Control.

&amp;#x200B;

Because this is what the Darkness is in the end. Its oppressive, it stiffles hope and freedom. 

The Pyramids chase the Traveler around, genociding every single species that has received her gifts, turning planets she has terraformed and undoing the work, turning them back to lifeless rocks, or worse, corrupting them and twisting their form, because the Winnower wants a universe where the Light doesnt meddle with what it considers to be the natural order of things.

&amp;#x200B;

So when you go around breaking reality with your super in pvp, Stasis is there to freeze your ass and negate your space magic, because its what the Pyramids have done to the Traveler for millions of years now.

Is it fun gameplay to go against? Depends on who you ask, but this is as Darkness as Darkness can get.

You wanted Darkness subclasses? You get Darkness subclasses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Reality is chaotic and unruly; bind it, and bring it order.

&gt;We are no longer forced to endure your torture. There is no veil for you to hide behind. We see you plainly. Your orchestration has led to too many foul notes. All your attempts to subjugate this power have failed.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;You are a plague, and we are the cure. Your army will be eradicated, and the Hive will be a layer of dust, cushioning our footsteps. Trust me—you will hate it.

&gt;I find myself giddy at these thoughts. Revenge suits me, it seems. I no longer know fear. I am overcome with certainty. When next we come face-to-face, I will remove the bandages that shield me, so I may see you for all you are and all you are not. And you will see me and know that the fire that burns behind my eyes will be your oblivion, suffocating and searing you to ash.

&gt;Prepare yourself. I am your ruin.

Taken from ""To the Witch Queen"", from Eris Morn´s Regarding Stasis lore book.

&amp;#x200B;

The lore tabs I linked showcase the psychological effects that Darkness has on its wielders. The first is from Yardarm-14, member of the Kentarch-3 fireteam which embraced the Darkness inside the Black Garden.

The second is from Eris Morn, who wields Stasis as of Beyond Light, possibly even all the way back to Shadowkeep, if the cutscene with her inside the Pyramid Ship is any indication.

&amp;#x200B;

The Darkness *feels* good. It doesnt feel like a force of evil and death. It makes you surer of yourself, more confident in your abilities. Free from shackles and limitations.

Which is ironic, because once youre corrupted youre a tool of the Winnower, while the Light doesnt shackle you to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But think on this lore, and how it feels to use Stasis in pvp and pve. It feels really good, doesnt it?

Its fun, unique, and very very strong. I find it really satisfying to freeze a super and kill the user when I manage to pull it off in Crucible.

It feels amazing to freeze a bunch of enemies with my Titan Behemoth and then slide into them, crushing them all into bits. The Behemoth Super also feels the best, in my opinion, making the world quake as I smash the gauntlet into the ground, freezing everything in front of me as I fly through the air with the melee attack or slide into the crystals, shredding everything around them to bits.

&amp;#x200B;

The sound design as well. The sound of ice crystals being created, the crunch of ice shattering under my might, the reverberating sounds when you cast Winter´s Wrath (which makes everyone in the vicinity go ""oh shit"" if its on Crucible), etc.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all to say, that Stasis *feels* really good in a way the Light subclasses just cannot compare to.

And thats despite me enjoying the lore of this game obsessively, and being aware that the fun ice powers are the biggest no no in the story for many reasons that have been stated to us throughout the years.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is all a flavor win of design, because of course the Winnower would make his powers attractive and alluring.

Why would anyone join the force of genocide and all around evil of this setting willingly? Because what it offers is very difficult to resist.

&amp;#x200B;

Think on what Zavala said at the end of Beyond Light´s campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Kridis is defeated. But it is not the Fallen that concern me now......  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Its us.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Ive had time to think. Guardians are not immune to corruption. The pursuit of power has divided us before.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I dont know what comes next. But I know- I know- that we must remain in the Light.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I see fractures already. If we bend, we break.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Guardians must not use the Darkness. This is the Vanguard´s official position.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reads kind of like a joke now, doesnt it? Has anyone here seriously followed Zavala´s order?

Most havent. Stasis is rampart on pvp, strikes, gambit, raids, everywhere. The Darkness is everywhere.

Zavala, the highest ranking authority within the Guardians, got completely ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

But there arent any consequences to using the fun ice powers right? 

&amp;#x200B;

DestinyTheGame,If you're looking for something to do in Destiny and have never tried a raid before - Try a Raid!,"Raiding for the average player in Destiny isn't the most common thing, but I wish that more people would give it shot. Raids are some of the best experiences you can have in the gaming industry, Especially going in blind. Going in with a full fireteam of people that have never done a specific raid and figuring out those mechanics is incredibly rewarding and satisfying. LFG can be a crazy place sometimes, but I know I've certainly met hundreds of incredible, hilarious groups that make the experience fun for everyone involved. In short, if you have never tried a raid for any reason, give it a shot! You don't need the greatest gear, mods, or anything like that, just a willingness and patience to learn.",1615816272,2021-03-15 09:51:12
DestinyTheGame,How to get 7 kills in 1 invasion triumph?,"Ive been struggling with this triumph for MONTHS. Every single time i invade, once i get the 4th kill, it automatically pulls me back. I have absolutely 0 clue on how to get to 7. Ive looked up clips on youtube on how to do it and everyone ive seen either lets them stay and just keep killing or they get pulled right at 4 and just get a lucky super that gets the whole team. There has to be a better way than just getting lucky, right?",1615815916,2021-03-15 09:45:16
DestinyTheGame,Stasis has made PvP a miserable experience.,"I genuinely believe stasis should be disabled for PvP.

Now I know there's been some good nerfs in the right direction, but I just don't think such heavy stun mechanics belong in a game with such tight controls and heavily movement reliant combat.

Stasis is one of the few classes where the grenade, melee and super almost all lead to a near unavoidable death, and it's frustrating to be locked in place and forced to watch.

It seems stasis ranges from unfair feeling to blatantly stupid, take for example, the hunter super. Does it need to last so long? Maybe. Does it need to move and chase people? Absolutely not. You touch it and you die. You sometimes respawn in the one that killed you since it can be fired from so far away. It's ridiculous.

The grenades encourage some of the silliest plays I've seen in destiny. Running to the enemy control point at the beginning of the match, just to lob a cold dome that sucks and freezes everyone inside for a free follow-up special grenade launcher shot shouldn't be so easy for people to pull off. 

The grenade with the seeking projectile shouldn't have a blast radius that catches you if you jump away, or can snag multiple people, it seeks in, that should be enough.

It feels like if you aren't playing stasis, you're handicapping yourself. Even moreso if you don't play hunters. I'm not saying Destiny has had the best track record for versatile PvP we all remember the days of Thorn, Last Word, The MIDA, etc. But I honestly feel it's never felt like the scales have been this tilted before. 

I just hate this feeling that so many deaths feel undeserved, that my toe skimmed a shard of ice and my enemy gets to run up and kill me for it, or a hunter just getting to fire and forget with their super. 
At least look me in the eyes as you kill me. 

Sorry for the long ass rant I know there's a million others like it, I just needed to get this off my chest. I took a break back when shadowkeep dropped and came back at the beginning of this season.
Between all this and sunsetting it just feels like the game has stripped away the variety of many things in favour of a new, worse direction. 

Stasis is fine and fun in PvE, but it's too extreme for PvP is what I feel, and I hope I've managed to convey why. 
Thanks for reading.",1615815897,2021-03-15 09:44:57
DestinyTheGame,Give cold-heart some cold in a unique way,"Rather than ignore the lore of the gun and make the beam cold, consider making it have an alt fire of a stasis slow to freeze blast based on the amount of the mag fired in one trigger pull before hand. This gives it a tie in to the name more directly,  a new exotic perk that isn't ""just a trace rifle"", and means it can serve as an add clear device after dumping damage into a major or boss enemy.",1615815657,2021-03-15 09:40:57
DestinyTheGame,Has Destiny 2 Patrols Improved? (Bit of a rant),"So I haven't played since SoA, and despite numerous times trying to get D2 reinstalled since then its been a real pain since my ps4 absolutely hates d2 for no reason. 

But the thing is, I don't care much for strikes or crucible that much. From what I've heard, Crucible now is an balanced rage-fest. I mean, its always been like that, but still.

But what I'm really worried about are the patrols. To be honest, patrols are my favorite part of destiny. I absolutely love them. But when I played D2 in SoA, I always found them to be bit of a downgrade in D2 compared to D1 patrols. Most people probably didn't notice this, but I doubt most people even bother with patrols.

My 2 main problems with the patrols in d2:

Less variety. In d1, even scavenging patrols had variety. Gathering wire wraps, shock cores, cabal belts, hive dust, etc. But in d2, I always ended up getting the same things all the time. Journals for trostland, rune tablets for Ana, and fallen junk for failsafe. It was always the same thing every time.
Even the dialogue has less variety. In d1, you had plenty of dialogue for each mission from a multitude of characters from zavala to eva to even the factions. When doing patrols in d2, however, its always the exact same lines from the exact same person. After grinding for a ship on mars, I was absolutely sick of Ana's voice. 

D1 patrols actually felt important. Felt like I was actually helping the city. Holiday needs parts for our ships? I'll grab them off of dead vex and fallen. Zavala needs the area cleared for a strike? Sure (heck, that line felt immersive since I was always seeing strike teams pop up after doing an extermination mission).  Eva Levante needs those swivel turrets for... decorative purposes? Ok! But in d2, its the same darn line for the same darn mission from the same darn person over and over again. 

But in D2 I recall Devrim going off about how the Farm needs supplies but he's sending me off to get... journals? What are journals going to do to help us in the wild?  What about red legion ""supplies""? I doubt the people will be able to eat whatever is in there, much less use it. Some parts at least felt important though. Sloane needs tools for repairing the arcology structures? sure, but I don't see how hive runes are going to work with that. Asher needs stuff to research? Ok, but that only helps him, not the city. And Failsafe, well... all her missions can be chalked up to boredom. I don't feel like I'm helping the city or its people in d2. helping out the farm and individuals, sure, but not the city. 

I want to help the city. I don't want to be the spotlight Guardian, the hero of the story. I want to be that Guardian who keeps your ship supplied, the people fed, who gives eva the stuff she needs to keep you looking cool, the guy who gets the vanguard the intel for the strikes, and the guy who clears that strike zone for you. Killing gods? Thats all you, my friends.

So after that little rant, I'm wondering: did the patrols get better after SoA? Do they feel better? Is there more variety and immersion again? Or is the Exo Stranger now sending us to pick up all the bullets we've littered across Europa?",1615815466,2021-03-15 09:37:46

DestinyTheGame,What class should I main?,"Hello everyone, I have a quick question for anyone that can help me. I've been going back and forth on my main character for months now, and it's starting to hold me back in terms of grind, but also in enjoyment, as I have to do every quest multiple times. Back in Destiny 1, I had one of each character, and moved around a fair amount, though I mostly played Warlock since I did a lot of solo content. Lately, however, I just don't have the time I used to, and I need to focus my attention on one particular character. I mostly play PvE, but I do spend my fair shar of time in the Crucible, though I don't really do Trials or raids due to a lack of people to play with.  


In PvP, I tend to have a playstyle that is more about flanking and surprising the enemy, rather than just plowing into the team. I like to mainly use snipers and HC's for this, since I can be effective from any range. I tend to get caught out by myself a lot, as I don't really move with the team due to my flanking style.  


I want to start with my pros and cons of each, to explain my reasons for playing a class. I will not be including Titan, as I have never really enjoyed the class as a whole, even in D1. I dislike the intense melee focus it has, as it doesn't fit in the way that I like to play Destiny.   


***Hunter:***  


With the hunter, I really enjoy the movement (no surprise there), and how fluid it feels to play. I also like the fact that when playing higher end PvE, I'm not just stuck playing support class every time. The look and style of the armor is also something I really like. I find most of the abilities to be fun, and the dodge has saved me more times than I can count.   


I dislike the squishiness of the character, since I mostly spec for recovery and mobility, and I tend to get one-shotted by most of the major enemies. I also really do not like arcstrider in any capacity, I find it to be underwhelming and not as fun to play as something like arc blade from D1.  


***Warlock:***  


With Warlock, I feel like I can be effective in pretty much anything the game throws at me, and I seem to have an ability or exotic for any situation. I also tend to favor their jump the most, as I feel like I can hit any ledge or land wherever I want with little difficulty, or with burst glide I can be the fastest player on the fireteam. I also really enjoy how a lot of the subclasses fit and build off of each other, example something like TTD. While most of the armor looks bad to me, the ones that look good are incredible in my opinion (though still now as good as D1, looking at you Crota set with full ornaments).  


The issues I have with warlock are more with how they feel in crucible and raids. In crucible, I feel limited to using either TTD or Chaos Reach, the latter of which is getting nerfed. I feel like I die more in blink than any other movement ability in the game, and it gives you major downsides. I also feel like there are few exotics to use, as most seem catered around PvE. In  raids, I hate being relegated to using Well all day every day, as I fid the subclass to be extremely boring to play.   


Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me with this decision. The classes are a huge time commitment, so I want to pick wisely. Thanks!!",1615814806,2021-03-15 09:26:46
DestinyTheGame,The 120 HC Meta?,"I’m not a big PVP guy.  I pretty much stick to QP Control and Iron Banner; and usually only play till I complete my bounties.  I do enjoy PVP but I find it stresses me out and that’s not why I play video games (side topic for another day).

Recognizing that 120 HCs are the meta right now I grinded Gambit for a decent Bottom Dollar. So naturally, I hop into some QP to test out the new toy....I don’t get it??  I hand a few good games and was able to get some awesome two taps, but overall I lost a lot of gunfights and probably played some of my worst PVP in a while.

To date, I’ve used ARs and PRs as my primary and faired pretty well.  Then after some digging, I’ve learned that the TTK for 120s is 1s and the body shit TTK is 1.5s! Slower than both ARs and PRs?? 

My question is...am I missing something? What makes the 120s meta and are they Ideal for six player modes or just comp. Should I keep using them till I get better at landing consistent headshots or just cut my losses and stick to the tried and true Dad Rifles?

I appreciate any honest input. Oh and I have a Bottom Dollar for sale! :)",1615814356,2021-03-15 09:19:16

DestinyTheGame,My Warlock GM build for Devils Lair tomorrow.,"Just some background im a hardcore D2 Pve player whos gotten conqueror every season so far. Just giving my build to help some of you guys complete the Grandmaster tomorrow. Just remember take it slow and team shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons,

&amp;#x200B;

Kinetic : Succession with anti barrier (reconstruction and recombination with a major spec) Im mainly using sucession because its a 72RPM sniper which means it does the highest amount of damage per shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Energy : Imperial needle with overload (Archers tempo and opening shot with major spec) Mainly using this bow to cover all element. Perks dont really matter too much with this but archers tempo is preferred.

&amp;#x200B;

Heavy: Anarchy mainly because i can just shoot 2 on an enemy and let the tick damage do its thing. Mainly gonna be useful against brigs, the tank and the boss. will be useful against champions.

&amp;#x200B;

Subclass is well of radiance for obvious reasons. Make sure to use healing grenades a lot cause that overshield can be the difference between you getting one shot by a sniper.

&amp;#x200B;

Amour mods

&amp;#x200B;

Helmet, Grenade launcher ammo finder and sniper rifle ammo finder, high energy fire

&amp;#x200B;

Arms, overload bow, Anti barrier sniper, taking charge

&amp;#x200B;

Chest piece (phoenix protocol exotic), Resilience mod, 2 concussive dampeners and stacks on stacks.

Boots, resilience mod, sniper scavenger (from artifact so it only takes 1 energy), grenade launcher scav and supercharged (allows you to have 4 stacks of charged with light up to a maximum of 5 if your running multiple of these)

&amp;#x200B;

Class item, Sundering glare (artifact mod), perpetuation and protective light.

&amp;#x200B;

Charged with light helps you to take out champions faster due to high energy fire giving you a 20% damage increase. and protective light will help you stay alive. Very useful inside a well of radiance.

&amp;#x200B;

The main strategy would be to focus smaller ads and then take out champions later once you cleared most of the ads. Make sure your always team shooting champions and majors. Communicate with your team so your all focusing the same champions, bosses or majors. 

&amp;#x200B;

In places with overload champions remember that you can stun them to stop them from shooting you and focus ads while their stunned. It makes it a lot easier to manage them. Since your a warlock make sure to place constant rifts so your teammates are always healing which will also give you increased ability regen due to the subclass perks.

DestinyTheGame,Presage sucks for repeating content,"Playing Pressage for the first time was a really, really nice experience.

A very spooky and claustrophobic experience to tell the story. 

Playing it the first time the boss was a real clutch.

But having to play it multiple times for the seasonal challenge and on master difficulty breaks the mission. 

After knowing how the puzzles go and where enemies are, it just becomes a long chore. The only interesting parts are the hangar fight and the boss fight. 

A run takes 30 minutes if you are playing on point with state of the art loadout. But for many that will be more. 

The boss fight itself is a huge cheese-fest that (as it apparently has become normal) is designed around owning Anarchy. Bonus points for relying on the janky jump mechanics and holding on to ledges. Nothing better than bumping into pipes that eat your jump when you try to jump up the vent to get to the upper area or your guarding deciding to not hold onto the ledge or the boss just hitting you through the floor or the boss disappearing and appearing in front of you to for quick one-clap.

So how could Bungie improve this mission and possible future missions without sacrificing the exposition of the story?

Let us unlock shortcuts. I'm pretty sure crawling through kilometers of vents is not the most ideal way to traverse a ship. So in successive playthroughs we unlock doors to get one from one section to the next without going through the repetitive content. Maybe after the third playthrough one has all shortcuts unlocked.",1615808941,2021-03-15 07:49:01

The next round starts with 10 Guardians and the first 8 to reach 10 kills are qualified.  
 

The next round starts with 8 Guardians and the first 6 to reach 10….you get the point  
 

The pattern repeats itself until Round 5  
 

Upon reaching round 5, so the 4-Man FFA, you should get the equivalent of the 7-Rounds Trials wins.  
 

To get Flawless you need to win this round. And go up against the last guardian on a 1-1 to claim the prize.  
 

The numbers above are up for debate. This idea centres around the idea of small short engagements and thinking outside the box.   
 

Let me know what you think. Your ideas, improvements and lets use this as a base for a healthy discussion.  
 

TL;DR: Fight 6-Rounds in a FFA. Reach Kills to qualify for next round. Last round 1-1",1615808720,2021-03-15 07:45:20
DestinyTheGame,Confession of a casual player,"Hi,

This is probably my second post on Reddit in my life. It won't be an outpouring of grief for the game, or a question for the community. Simply a reflection after a conversation with a fellow member of the clan I play in. Well, he recently said that until there is a new Grand Master level in the game, he doesn't really have much to do (he has 1330+ Light). As a matter of fact I've been seeing him almost non-stop in the game, while I, crushed by real life duties, could afford to play an hour or two a week (usually every other day) and a bit longer on weekends. And you know what, every time I turn the game on I'm glad I still have so much to do! 

I'm a casual gamer, and I'm proud of it. I don't speed run the game, I don't read tutorials on how to max out a character fastest or find the best loadout. I discover most secrets on my own or bump into them by accident. OK, if I get blocked somewhere I use the Internet or I use it when someone on Twitter e.g. advises me to buy a particular mod from Banshee. Fact, I play mostly PvE but thanks to that I don't get annoyed like that guy who complains about PvP balance. I'm lucky to belong to a clan that will take me on a raid from time to time. I treat it as a supplement to the joy of discovering more lore entries from the open world. I still have my inventory plenty of quests. I don't want to tell anyone how to play, or which way to consume the game is better. **In fact, I guess I want to thank Bungie for making a game that allows both just casual and hardcore gamers to enjoy** (as long as they don't start complaining about the lack of challenge that is ;)).

What do you guys think?",1615808421,2021-03-15 07:40:21

DestinyTheGame,"Considering champions are an integral part of destiny gameplay mechanics, we should be having more freedom with champion mods usage. Also include a tutorial in first light campaign for new players.[MORE SUGGESTIONS IN POST]","So champions have been a an integral part of destiny gameplay for more than a year. Earlier they were in endgame activites but now they are almost everywhere. With main seasonal activities having them as integral part. Upcoming master raids version will also have them in abundance. Extotic quest also have them even in normal version. I would like to suggest few suggestions for upcoming seasons.                     
                      
1) A tutorial SHOULD be mandatory for new players in the quest line of Shaw han or anywhere in between. It should tell people how to stun a champion. Include minor things also like when champion is glowing you cannot stun them etc.                                  
2) We should have more accessibility of choosing weapons when it comes to stun champions. UNLOCK all mods automatically whenever we get the new seasonal artifact. Special champion mods for e.g sniper rifle anti barrier can be gated behind XP progression.                                      
3) More DIVERSITY of weapons type should be included. This season sniper rifle anto barrier is straight up my favorite mod. I can DPS AND STUN with same weapon. If these mods are locked with primary weapons only, it becomes difficult sometimes to run solo activities with champions in them.                                 
5) The above problem can also be solved by including more and more EXOTIC WEAPONS with intrinsic perks (e.g erainas vow, leviathan breath, devils ruin etc) for stunning champions. Previously issued exotics which are underused can be given such perks via catalyst or via addition of intrinsic perk. This will help players in seasons where their favorite weapon type don't have seasonal mods. Some examples for such weapons will be giving antibarrier to Arbalest, overload on 1K Voices etc.                              
6) Try not to lock down element specific abilities associated champion mods. For e.g meele ability of any element will stun unstoppable should be the mod. Charge them with more energy and make them permanent mods.                             
These are few of my suggestion more are welcome in post.",1615807117,2021-03-15 07:18:37

DestinyTheGame,"Gambit is one of the, if not THE, most miserable experiences I’ve had playing this game","Speaking as someone who grinded out Gambit to reset their infamy this week, Gambit is tied with Trials as the worst game mode currently in Destiny. An absolutely miserable time for anyone who isn’t in a four stack, Gambit’s problems include:

* Playing on the same four maps because there hasn’t been a new map since season six and the others got put into the DCV.
* Power ammo still swinging games to a ridiculous degree. As much fun as it is getting repeatedly killed by Xenophage/Eyes of Tomorrow/Truth spamming invaders, it’s not.
* Power ammo not dropping for an entire match for some players and dropping frequently for others.
* The team that pulls ahead even for a moment wins the match most of the time as they can spam invasions and absolutely nuke their boss (especially with swords and the new titan chest piece), regardless of the progress of the other team. 
* Solo’s being queued against three and four stacks.
* Motes still being buggy when you pick them up off the ground. (There seems to be a new issue where motes fly into the air and back down again or just get stuck under the ground? Not sure if it’s just me.)
* Drop rates of the weapons still being low. I played around 25 or so games and received the fusion rifle twice and didn’t get the hand cannon at all. 

Any improvements Prime made to the game mode have not been carried over to this current iteration of Gambit. And given that there was zero mention of Gambit in the State of the Game TWAB, I can’t believe that Bungie is currently happy with how the game mode is currently playing out. Please can we get some improvements to it so something considered a core activity is actually bearable to play?",1615803398,2021-03-15 06:16:38

DestinyTheGame,Playlist Specific Drop Rates need a buff,"Friendly reminder that this definitley has to be addressed.

The only playlists I really grind are PvP and now due to the BD Gambit and it really is a travesty.

From what I heard I might even have slightly over average luck with the Bottom Dollar but getting 3 (!) Over TWO infamy resets with a lot wins (hence not the largest amount of games needed for this but still a damn high amount) is an absolute joke.

Frozen Orbit is not much different. Yes this is a problem, specifically because the incredibly large perk pool (while beneficial in terms of variability) means the already incredibly low drop rate drops to basically zero for a specific roll. 

If you thought grinding for Spare Rations was bad, this is a whole new level, at least mathematically.

So, Bungie. Increase drop rates. Simple. It will still take a long while to get a roll you want but for casual players it is nigh impossible to get a decent kind of roll at the moment (and based on my hour account I would not consider myself casual).",1615802448,2021-03-15 06:00:48
DestinyTheGame,K1Crew Quarters - Master Lost Sector,"Just finished a few runs of this and wanted to pass some helpful hints.  I was able to get my Necrotic Grips finally, so that was awesome!

My loadout was Primary bow (Overload), Polaris Lance (Shield Pierce) and Tomorrow's Answer (Void)

Top Tree Voidwalker w/ Contraverse Hold (for Overloaded grenade)

Place an Arc Resistance on your chest piece, it'll help.  All void damage is increased, hence all the void. The splash damage from PL and from killing exploding shanks can proc Wrath of Rasputin, to get some warmind cells.

Overloaded Champions - Stun them with bow, throw overloaded nade on them, continue to shoot them with bow shots at a distance, sidestepping from out of cover and back again with shots to avoid the barrage of fire, and they will not move or regenerate their health.  If you want to, you can finish them off with the rocket launcher. The Polaris Lance made for never running out of ammo on crit shots, and worked especially well to break the shields on all the shanks and to take out the Shielded Servitors.

Main Boss shank, Polaris Lance is great for whittling down until you spawn the next champion, cycle overloaded nades, rocket launcher and Nova Bomb.

I just took my time, slow and steady to kill everything, was able to do my few runs in about 20 mins each, with only a death or two before the timer went out because I was pushing myself.  I was at 1328 light, but I believe this build could help anyone that's a bit behind on light as well.

Good Luck Guardians and may your exotic drop the first time!

(Also I heard if you go in with a full inventory of engrams that any Lost Sector exotic could drop, so if you haven't gotten the Chest or Helmet then there's a chance that will go to your Postmaster instead.)",1615802272,2021-03-15 05:57:52

DestinyTheGame,Master Lost Sector Rewards,"Hey all, was thinking about this for a few days. I ran the Master Lost Sector Exodus Garden 2A over in the Cosmodrome when it was in rotation and I ran about 4-5 times with no rewards at the end. I know killing Champions gives a better drop rate for loot at the end in general, but to have a few flawless runs as well as time ran under the 15 minute mark I thought maybe something was off. 

I've heard varying opinions on what the drop chance just not being great (whether it being exotics, or any rewards in general) but I was wondering if me maining my Warlock \*potentially\* has something to do with it?

What I mean is I main Warlock, so I have all of his Exotics and the like. Is it possible that the drop chance may taper off because of the amount of things done with my Warlock? Or am I overthinking and just having bad runs with loot? I'm really trying to armor grind for stats now that I know what I'm looking for, and I thought its best to go for Heads and Arms since typically that's what I use in terms of exotics, but as it stands those flawless runs (knowing full well that Flawless doesn't really factor into loot at the end) haven't yielded anything.

So....thoughts?",1615800052,2021-03-15 05:20:52

DestinyTheGame,Here is how PvP feels for a lower skilled player,"Speaking about Control like playlists, the system always matches players like this:

*2 top players, 2 mid players, 2 low players on each side.*

The problem now for lower skilled players like me is, the lower skilled players always remain the lower skilled players. The system never matches a game where lower skilled players also could be the top players. It's a system that doesn't adapt. 2 Diamond, 2 plat/gold, 2 bronze/silver players. Always.  And the team that has the better 2 top players wins the game. The other players aren't that important. If you win a game as a lower player or not really is not that important. The experience is always bad. We always feel like fodder for the top players. That's the reason we are in that match. 

It's like you and your homies from the neighborhood go out to play a bit Basketball but as opponents you don't get some guys from the next neighborhood but you always face a NBA team. Always. Really, always! For some time you go out and try to compete with them. You hear tips about beeing good from good players(like Ascendent Nomad) but in the end you always have to face LeBron. And LeBron is super motivated and plays like it's the final game to win the cup. Needless to say that at some point 99% of the guys stop playing because it's no fun.

And the only answer to this is to get matched with players in your skill range. I mean i get that for top players this also means there won't be any lambs that they can slaughter. But honestly it's the only way to get more players into PvP. I'm in a 9 man raidgroup and i am the only one left playing pvp. This group was active and had fun as SBMM was active. Now nobody plays.

It's different for comp. I don't win every game there but 99% of the games i get some kills and have the feel as if i was part of the game in a positive way.

I know it isn't the solution to all problems and it doesn't make you a pvp god. Things like game sense, map knowledge, builds for pvp are still very important but with players in your range you have some positive success vibes now and then.  

I really hope this gets some attention even though what i basically say is to bring back SBMM. I feel it's the only way to get back some players.",1615799484,2021-03-15 05:11:24

I feel for them but it makes Bungie look so much better in comparison. I'm not saying our complaints aren't valid, quite the opposite. They are, because we have a developer who listens. To also be fair to Rockstar I have no idea how their engine works in comparison to Destiny 2, but from what I am hearing about their next game update, their community doesn't sound very happy. 

It also makes me happy knowing that Bungie has made a multiplayer experience that really give players a chance to grief others, because boy is RDO one of the most toxic multiplayer experiences out there. In Destiny 2 for the most part we are all in it together even though we might squabble over nerfs, fotl armor sets, and other things.

DestinyTheGame,Bow mods are FAR to expensive,"currently bows one of the most unused weapons in the game and yet have rather expensive mods, only being outdone by handcannon, 

even some special weapon mods cost less such as fusion and shotgun targeting.

this is silly in my mind, if bows where ever present and performing like an handcannon within pvp and smgs in PvE, i would understand expensive mods.

but with the 1 in 100 chance of seeing a wild bow in a PvP match, compared to the 100% chance of seeing an shotgun and handcannon. fair to say they arent even in the same tournament

Handcannon are at the Olympics whilst bows are in the school sponsored little leagues game.

and as a bow guy this hurts to say, but they arnt the best.

the ONLY reason i think bungie would leave them as expensive as they are is leviathans breath, which from my experience is as rare as hens teeth, it exists but rare as hell. and even then exotics are meant to be the exception to the rule NOT the rule it's self

i honestly think bow mods should be equal to pulse rifle mods in cost. cheaper then the meta but still not 1 energy point",1615797008,2021-03-15 04:30:08

""Talk to me about how you feel.""

""I wish we would go home.""

""You're on a rampage, and I'm not comfortable with it.""

""I don't think this is why the Traveler chose you.""

""You know I'll never leave you, right?""

""But sometimes… I don't like the look in your eyes.""

DestinyTheGame,Can we get more disruption exotics,"currently there is only 1 exotic weapon capable of stunning an overload champion, divinity.

where as there is 2 for the others,

now I'm NOT wanted every exotic to come with an champion mod, nor most new exotics to come with one, but i do want more choice exotic wise for champions

i feel that they should be limited in number and BASED around the mod to an descent degree, prime example divinity

and with a descent amount of weapons missing catalysts i think an cool idea would be the introduction of champion mods as an part of the catalyst, not the WHOLE catalyst

example;

two tailed fox; disruption/overload champion,

DestinyTheGame,More uses for champion mods OUTSIDE of champions?,"This was originally gonna be a reply to a comment on a thread, but it started getting so long winded I figured I'd just post it separately. 

I was thinking about the (very common) question about seasonal mods and how they could/should be implemented in the future. A lot of people (myself included) think that they should be passive bonuses that you unlock as you level up, and NOT mods that take away from your build potential.
This would still allow weapons like the lament feel cool since it would always be anti barrier, but still allow for other seasons to have a different effect for swords in general. 

The problem with that is currently there's very little use for the mods outside of champions. There are plenty of mechanical uses, such as getting through taken vandal bubbles, but they don't really do anything with that info.
(My square brain only put two and two together when I was playing the hawkmoon mission and was wondering why my night watch was still hitting the vandals)

So what if they could just start designing enemy encounters and variations around having these intrinsic anti champion effects? 

Imagine levels with high taken vandal/phalanx density during a season where anti barrier is on autos or lmgs, allowing you to cut through them if you bring the right guns. Or an encounter where enemies are set to use abilities much more frequently, requiring you to pack an overload weapon to give yourself a fighting chance!

You could even have the encounters stay the same in different activities throughout the year, which would make for interesting combos as the seasonal upgrades change.

Who knows, maybe they could give the mods more utility outside of combat. Like having a switch behind a barrier that you have to shoot through, or a terminal that you need to overload. 

I just think they really aren't fully taking advantage of the mods right now, here's to hoping we'll see more flexibility and fun with them in the future.",1615792842,2021-03-15 03:20:42

DestinyTheGame,I feel like Titans need more projectile supers,"As a titan main it kinda feels like there is only one super that is useful in endgame PVE content (which is bubble).

Especially when most titan supers are melee focused like the entirety of the striker subclass and behemoth. And honestly I want something new. (Sorry for going on a tangent there) 

Tl:dr  I just want to use a super that doesn’t involve me getting stomped all the way to Brazil when I try to get close to a boss or being the bubble bitch that can only do support.(give titan some DPS capabilities)

Since witch queen is probably gonna give us a darkness subclass I propose that they should give us Titans the destiny equivalent of a Spartan laser with 3 shots and piercing capabilities (kinda like sleeper simulant) from halo or maybe a hive chitin crossbow/ballista.

The fragments for the Spartan laser could be that you get more 2 shots at the cost of a 15% super damage decrease and a -5 recovery or maybe add an effect like cauterize from D1 that jumpstarts your health regeneration.

And for the crossbow or ballista make the hive chitin create week spots on the enemy or make the chitin shatter and have a blast radius.",1615791143,2021-03-15 02:52:23

DestinyTheGame,Bungie doesn’t understand “difficulty”,"Hello, this is my first time posting in the Destiny Reddit or in any destiny forum/group ever. First I want to apologize off the bat if you do not agree with what I am about to say, this is in my opinion something important to a lot of people, so please take the time to read it. I’d appreciate it.

So, I have been playing destiny 2 since launch. I will start by saying I am not someone who played D1 so maybe things were different back then, however a major complaint I have about D2 is difficulty. Or more so, the lack of difficulty. 

Playing any story missions in destiny that are part of a campaign, you would probably agree with me that it’s a cake walk. The same thing with vanguard strikes and such. While it is no fun to do something easy with no reward, I do not enjoy torture with little rewards either. 

Maybe this complaint is only mine alone but slapping “modifiers” on something and spawning in enemies that eat bullets. (The reason I say they eat bullets is something I will come back to.) It makes the activity an annoyance, something so hard to play simply because it’s a hassle to deal with.

 Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I don’t mind modifiers. I like them, I love the elemental burns, I enjoy champions, and some of these modifiers do provide difficulty to activities. As someone who plays master nightfalls almost daily this season, I can say that the modifiers in that activity specifically are not the problem. 

The area I feel there’s a problem is lost sectors. I just came out of over an hour of attempting the Master K1 lost sector on the moon for exotic arms, just to come out empty handed. The reason for this, I had a lot of failed attempts, and one successful attempt where I got a legendary engram from the end rewards? That doesn’t seem right but that’s a different issue. 

So, is this a rant about the lost sectors themselves? No, I think it’s great bungie put in an activity that has solo playability and value. The rant is about modifiers and champions within them. For example, arc burn, fine it’s manageable if you’re prepared. The champions are a different story.

For reference I am a 1329 Hunter with Max Mobility, Recovery, and high resilience. I have the stats to do these things which as why I said the burn modifiers aren’t a big deal. The big deal with when you spawn about 4-5 champions in one area on a solo activity. Once again I don’t think it’s impossible to beat those champions solo. It is with enough time which you don’t have in the lost sectors. But time isn’t the problem. It is the mods themselves.

Overload smg takes a whole clip to stun a champion. Unstoppable hand canons and pulse rifles have a ridiculous wait time just for the shot to hit and not stun the champion. Overload swords take around 5-6 hits. Anti barrier sniper takes a minimum 2 shots to destroy a barrier, and scout rifles take about 6. So after taking into account all these mods having obscure start up times and functionality, what do you do?

Personally I tried all those mods and well they’re mediocre if they can even do their job. But the one that is supremely terrible is overload bow. Almost every arrow says it’s overload yet it never seems to stun anything ever. But on the off chance it does, it’s not doing it again for eight years. Maybe this is all due to a cool down on champion stuns. If so, please take it out of the game. What is the point of giving players mods to stun champions if there’s a safe period for them to instantly heal before you can stun them again.

So dealing with that issue in and of itself is terrible but then mix that with mods like attrition and it just makes me want to uninstall the game. I really hope I don’t sound terrible and someone can agree with me. Like I said I just think mods need to be fixed, or the champion stun cool down needs to go altogether. Lastly I’d love if bungie put more time into making things difficult every week somehow without slamming on nine modifiers and calling it hard.",1615790470,2021-03-15 02:41:10
DestinyTheGame,End-of-Season loot ideas,"Hammer of Proving - Exotic Aggressive Frame Sword There are only two aggressive frame swords, and both of them are sunset. And a hammer would be awesome to use as a heavy weapon. 

Personal War Beast - Exotic Sparrow
I chose to add this because D2's sparrows are lacking diversity when compared to D1's. We had those cool flashy sparrows with different sounds, designs and trails. 
Having a literal war beast as a sparrow also fits the cabal theme of the season, and the war beast is the only animal in the game, or at least the only thing resembling one.
If the season ""ends well"", it could probably be a gift from our beloved Caiatl. 

Exotic or Legendary armor: We had some cool cabal themed armor pieces in D1, like psion flayer capes for hunters and mau'ual's maulers for titans. It would be cool to have them at least as strike exclusive loot for Proving Grounds, the new strike.

ETC.  


And to be honest, it would make for a much, much better tutorial then New Light. It simply does not replace the amount of content and characters The Red War had. Noone likes Shaw Han Bungie. *NOONE.*  


The only confusing part could be ""Wait the Cabal attacked us why are we in alliance with them now?"" and you know how *that* can be solved?

TLDR: Bring back Red War as the start of the game. Rework it slightly to work with new changes and removed content EG make the missions on removed planets the only parts of those planets. Add a Haunted style ""The Story So Far"" cutscene when complete that summerizes the parts of Destiny 2 people missed, like why Cayde is dead, why Uldren is good now, why we are no longer in a war with the Cabal on Mars ETC.

DestinyTheGame,[D2]Customizable weapon animations ( IDEA),"So, as you all know, destiny as a whole is a game that allows the players to modify pretty much everything about their experience, from armor, shading, sparrows and ships, exotics, and most important of all, guns 

The thing that brought this idea to mind, was when i loaded up in multiple zones and my character and equipment was loading in, so, when you shoot and reload the gun sounds and reloads like the base preset for that category of gun, i dont know if this happens to all weapons but i’ve had it happen to revolvers, shotguns and auto rifles

This made me think, if all weapons have the same base preset for sound and animations, but stats, and perks remain the same and the look and anim. are put on top, this could mean that any (for example) revolver could use any animation of that category ( except fan firing bc last word is the only one)

I dont think im the only one that uses certain guns for their animations and looks rather than meta stuff ( ace of spade’s reload) so this would be a BIG add to an already great player-defined experience

nor PvP or PvE will be affected by this change in any way, i think.

In short, being able to customize weapon animations would be a perfect addition to a game so deep on player customization. ( some guns dont apply, such as Dead man’s, top-breaking revolvers, etc) 

That made me think, there’s like no variation on pulse rifle anims. or snipers..mmm..

DestinyTheGame,Add the Spoils of War system DSC has to GoS and LW as well,"It’s extremely draining to do GoS or LW when you only get 1-3 chances per week to get anything out of them, and even more draining when you’re trying to get a specific roll on a gun, only to get guns with the same unwanted perks, or no drops of that gun at all, multiple times week after week.

Really kills any desire to do be those raids every week when the same unwanted perk combos and guns drop every time. 

In my case, i’ve had dozens of Ancient Gospels drop with the exact same perks as the last drop, while other perks have dropped one or zero times. Almost feels like certain perks are weighted to drop more often, and it makes chasing desired rolls feel like a waste of time.

Also doesn’t help that there’s almost nothing special about these weapons aside from looks, and that they’re really no different performance-wise to other guns that can be acquired far more frequently through systems like umbral engrams.

Thanks to DSC’s spoils system, this isn’t as big of an issue, as you can directly pick which guns you want as a reward for completing encounters. Because of this and because of the fact that spoils drop on repeat completions of DSC, the raid’s weapons feel far more enticing to go after.",1615786541,2021-03-15 01:35:41

DestinyTheGame,Know What To Do,"Know what to do, means, know what to do.

I’m fed up of joining raid groups on the Destiny raid groups through my app that title themselves as “KWTD” when they have 2 to 4 members who have no idea what they’re doing.

I end up leading this group through the entire raid, something I usually enjoy, but other experienced members who have also been duped eventually leave after the 2nd to 3 hour, which leaves me as the new leader of this group of newbies in the position of finding new people to join us near to the end of the raid (which no one wants to do) 

From the start usually I have to painstakingly lead them through every detail as people join and leave, because they’re frustrated that newbies don’t immediately know how to do a raid. 

I hate, HATE! “KWTD” posts when the host has a party of people who don’t know what to do, and then are terrible at telling those people what to do. It is FALSE ADVERTISING!!! Don’t do it, you scum bags!

I love being a sherpa, but every now and then, I want to join a party of people who KWTD.

Please bungie give us the D2 y1 meta back, fuck shotguns and before ""Just backpedal bro!"", yeah with the stupid design Bungie put in their maps is almost futile since you either back imto a wall or back into a damn random box, while a titan just slides right at you with wards on, since the start of this season and Beyond light as a whole, i havent seen a damn sniper in PVP only shotguns, and we are talking Console PVP.  


At this point you are forced to go wiht Felwinters, becuase even slug shotguns get outmatched, since the maps are so small you are practicably next to your enemy for the most part",1615785904,2021-03-15 01:25:04

DestinyTheGame,Conflicts on Morality of 3rd Person Peeking,"A bit of a AITA post, but this problem is heavily related to Destiny and I don't know where else to put it.  


Background: Me and 3 of my friends were playing Destiny 2 and had just completed a Nightfall. One suggested Private Rumble and we agreed to it. I was using Adored to train sniping as I was warming up for Trials.  


We played like normal rumble, using different loadouts and having fun. This one guy, who I will can Person X, was on 10 frames, but we continued playing as he could still hit his shots and actually move.  


I had cornered Person X, with his back to the wall and only a piece of cover standing between us. I threw a grenade, misdirected him with Gemini, and went in for the kill. Only then I noticed he was using a sword to 3rd person peek, and killed me with Felwinters. I got mad at him using 3rd person peeking, and proceeded to hunt him down until the match ended in 1 minute. I explained to him what I thought of 3-peeking, which was that it was disgusting to use, unfair to the rest of us playing in 1st person and that I was disappointed. I left, turned off my computer and cooled my head.  


However, a few friends of mine have said my reaction was unnecessary and they saw nothing wrong with using a sword, because anyone could do it. I personally find it against the sportsmanship of 1st person shooters, but now I'm not so sure if I should have cracked down that hard on Person X.   


Should I have let him be, or was my reaction actually justifiable? Help me reddit.",1615782283,2021-03-15 00:24:43

DestinyTheGame,Mods need a significant rework in more ways than one,"The mod system is currently both bloated and frustrating for new players, returning players, and even for those who possess most/all the mods. I played a friends account yesterday from 1100 to 1250 in comp and was shocked that you dont even have access to the +10 mobility, recovery etc as a new player. Only the +5s. I have a few suggestions that I think would make mods much more user friendly all around.

1. Remove all mod stacking. One of each mod works, that's it. Prevents issues with mods being too good and working in unintended ways. Possible exception can be made for combat style mods that were made the the intention of being stacked. 

2. Consolidate mod types to make creating our loadouts easier. By this i mean instead of 12+ of each finder, targeting, etc mod, they be consolidated based on ammo type. Primary weapon targeting, energy ammo finder, heavy weapon dexterity. You get the idea. Having 3 for each type instead of 12+ makes finding the one you want easier, and also means you dont have to switch unflinching SMG to unflinching pulse when going from pve to crucible. I promise it will be ok if hand cannon targeting costs less energy. Potential issues here: Arbalest, special vs heavy GLs, heavy ammo snipers+tractor cannon, maybe others. I dont know the best solution for these outliers.

3. Disabled all combat style mods in crucible. If its possible, disable them from working in the pvp component of gambit.

4. Disable aeon glove mods in gambit

5. MAKE ALL MODS EXCEPT COMBAT STYLE MODS AVAILABLE FOR NEW PLAYERS UPON CHARACTER CREATION. These should not be locked behind a playwall. Traction on console vs not having Traction is a very significant difference. Not being able to slap +10 mobility on w new character is ridiculous. At the very least, unlock all these mods once a new/returning player hits the current seasons LL soft cap.

6. Rework how banshee sells mods. Since weapon mods and the non combat style mods should be auto unlocks, all that should remain are cwl/warmind mods for now.. And maybe black armory weapon mods if you feel like holding those back. Banshee should sell 1 random mod from this pool every day. Banshee should have a quest that rewards you 1 random mod from this pool every day. Duplicate mods auto dismantle into 2 mod components. Quest costs 10 mod components and can be done once a day.

7. Weapons (including exotics) should gain an additional mod slot and anti champion mods should be moved back to weapons. All primary weapons should have access to anti barrier every season at the very least, though I believe they should have access to all champion mods every season, while special/heavies can stay on seasonal rotation.

8. Consolidate ghost mods. There are too many. Using the masterwork mods as an example, a good first step is to combine the 3 for each activity into one mod to get down to 5.",1615778969,2021-03-14 23:29:29

DestinyTheGame,Build title: Wind of Niflheim,"A build I was working on recently, which has a lot under the hood for both solo and fireteam play.   
**Note: This only works in PvE.**

&amp;#x200B;

Aspects: 

**Grim Harvest,** 

* Dodging slow enemy targets. 

**Winter's Shroud**  

* Defeating slowed/frozen targets drops crystals that grant melee energy that can be picked up by you or your allies.

&amp;#x200B;

Fragments: 

**Whisper of Impetus:** 

* Damaging targets with a Stasis melee reloads stowed weapons, grants boost to weapon ready speed 

**Whisper of Fractures:**

* your melee energy recharges faster when you are near two or more combatants

**Whisper of Refraction:**

* Defeating slowed or frozen targets grants you class ability energy

&amp;#x200B;

From these Aspects and Fragments alone I can almost grant myself a full charge with quicker cooldown, and give myself class ability from killing targets near me. No Shatterdive because it's just a hinderance to the concept. 

For armor, I'll give more detail as to show how it works.

**Helm:** 

Hands On x2.

* Gain bonus Super energy on melee kills

Chosen of the Warmind

* Collecting or destroying a Warmind Cell creates a concussive blast that pushes enemies away.

&amp;#x200B;

Arms:

Speedball.

* Increases Grenade throw distance

Momentum Transfer

* Causing damage with a grenade reduces your melee cooldown

Warmind's Light.

* Become charged with Light by collecting a Warmind Cell

&amp;#x200B;

Chest (exotic: The Sixth Coyote)

Arc Resistance x2.

* Reduces incoming Arc damage from combatants

Sheltering Energy.

* Collecting a Warmind Cell grants you an overshield

&amp;#x200B;

Legs:

Innervation.

* Reduces grenade cooldown each time you pick up an orb of Power

Recuperation

* Replenishes health each time you pick up an orb of Power

Argent Ordnance

* While charged with Light, readying or firing a rocket launcher grants it increased damage or reload speed. Damaging a combatant with a rocket consumes one stack of Charged with Light.

&amp;#x200B;

Cloak:

Glacial Inheritance.

* Defeating targets with your Stasis Super refunds energy

Elemental Light.

* Defeating a combatant with your super spawns an elemental well that matches your subclass type. 

&amp;#x200B;

DestinyTheGame,Please reconsider the sunsetting of a few *ritual* weapons;,"Namely the “**Komodo 4FR**”, “**Buzzard**”, “**Edgewise**”, and “**Exit Strategy**” since there’s an argument to be made about how powerful the others are compared to Bungie’s weapon roll paradigm shift plus the availability of select perks. 

(There’s reload + damage perk on “Randy’s Throwing Knife” and overflow on “Python”.)

As it stands, the rolls on these ritual weapons are either matched or overcome by other options:

**Exit Strategy** competes with the new battlegrounds smg “Extraordinary Rendition” in the kinetic slot. The battlegrounds smg simply has better base stats and better available perks. Having Exit Strategy not be power-locked would simply be another option that’s statically-rolled, which wouldn’t hurt.

**Komodo 4FR** is a linear fusion rifle, and has no other competition really because... well... near nobody uses them. It has solid perks that lend more to PvP, and it’s difficult to even say it has competition with how dead the weapon type is. Last season’s linear can roll the exact same perks, with even arguably better PvP perks.

**Edgewise** is the same archetype as the raid machine gun “Commemoration”, and can LITERALLY roll the same perk setup, but Commemoration is simply better because of its perks and base stats.

**Buzzard** is debatably kept dead, since no other kinetic or energy sidearms can roll fourth times the charm (afaik). It also has the fairly dead perk osmosis. Again, it’s simply another legendary option that could easily exist. (Cool model too might I add)

A shared theme is that all of these weapons are outclassed by their newer counterparts in almost every way. If anything, they’re just cool but wasted models if nothing is done by Bungie. They could exist in the kiosk as reliable but temporary statically-rolled replacements for their competition. It would add another option to each respective weapon type or slot with zero net negatives.

DestinyTheGame,Crest of alpha lupi and other random,"Since Crest sees very little play, what if the exotic allowed the titan to store extra charged with light orbs for the team, like after 10 stacks, you would send out pulse waves that would keep your fire team charged with light. This would allow fun builds in higher end content,  2 could run warmind builds or the new mods this season and wouldn't need taking charge or other mods to be charged with light? I'd also like the fast rez to come back for this piece?

(Correct me if I'm wrong) why don't we have a hawk swooping in tranmat effect, with the ca caw sound?

Next year for Crimson doubles....a sparrow with a side car!? That 2 can ride? Or a 2 person one, but the person in back has to sit backwards...cheesy yes, stupid yes.

A crucible Playlist equipment mayhem....no supers, abilities are normal, but you can equip 2 exotic weapons,  2 exotic armors?

Can we change the mini barricade on the titan? Maybe to a ""wedge shape ""( think snow plow) but this barricade could ""divert"" certain attacks to the side? 

Foe tracers...instead of randomly granting walhacks, what if they granted a version of true sight, but with footprints? Kinda like where your teammate in a super? Since you know hunters ""hunt""?

Darci...what if the person assistant actually after ADSing loaded the bullet needed for that champion?

Masterworking...
I think after armor is masterworked it should only cost 100 glimmer to swap mods,  depending on what I'm doing, crucible,gambit ,strikes, a raid...it can cost almost 10k swapping out mods, scavengers etc etc. Not everyone can get ""God rolled"" armor for ever element, and have a set for every game type....yes I know there's ways to get glimmer...but I think masterworked armor should have another ""perk"" vs just the 10 energy.

Master worked exotic armor...super expensive...yes golf balls aren't to hard to come by, but still it's alot of materials and time invested...maybe add us 2 energy to exotic masterworked armor? For total of 12? Most the good mods are 3 energy, plus scavengers are mostly 3, 
So legs could have grenade cool down, grenade launcher scavenger,rocker launcher scavenger, and taking charge on say stompees?

Silver for vault space...easy money maker for bungie...I'd gladly pay 500 silver for 200 more vault space? Especially since sunsetting is no more, I have some unique guns I'd still like to hold onto. Like my midnight coup with 10k kills on it.

New mods for guns...I know we are getting adept mods that do more, but for regular weapons...sprint grip, surrounded spec, radar tuner,radar booster....as far as I know aren't used....with rampage coming on fewer and fewer weapons I think its not used as much either....maybe a ""zoom mod"" to help with range on weapons with barrels?

Can raids, grandmaster nightfall, trials have a chance to drop fully masterworked gear? Used to from the pit? Either you like it....or get materials?

12 man events....I'm sure this has been talked about alot on how this could work etc. 
My ""idea"" once a month like IB there's a ""world invasion"" event 3 teams of 4 are broken up randomly from a fire team of 12....(Drifter/Osiris needs you to do something sketchy ) one team is put in an invasion, like Escalation protocol but there's champion's all 3 types, big enemies(like in ep)...the other 8 have to fight their way through to get to the team of 4 and hold ground do an objective. Every level would jump say 5 light points...if the whole team gets killed Drifter/Osiris calls you back and talks massive smack

Just random thoughts and rants",1615775127,2021-03-14 22:25:27

DestinyTheGame,Anyone else unable to pick up 3rd Captain's Log on Presage?,[removed],1615774688,2021-03-14 22:18:08
DestinyTheGame,The kill tracker system has been flawed for all of its existence and is in desperate need of a rework.,"Throughout the life of Destiny, Guardians have used kill trackers to show off their proficiency with their favorite guns. The way the system works is so overly complicated and there are some small QoL changes that could vastly improve user experience.

• **Exotics**
As it stands right now, only exotic weapons with a catalyst are eligible for a kill tracker. The problem is, not all exotic weapons have a catalyst (another problem for another day). Therefore, if your favorite exotic weapon just so happens to be lacking a catalyst, you’re out of luck. You just went on a week long gambit grind to get Malfeasance? Too bad, you can’t track your kills with your new gun. All exotic weapons should intrinsically be able to count your kills, even before you get a catalyst. These are the most rare and powerful weapons in the game, you deserve to be able to show your dedication to using them.

• **PvE and PvP trackers**
The separation of the regular kill tracker and the crucible kill tracker has always been unnecessarily complicated. While enemy kills and guardian kills should be tracked separately, the need to switch between trackers seems like a needless waste of time. Both trackers should be shown and tracking at the same time; there is no reason for it to be one or the other. 

• **Unlocking the tracker**
Right now, you have to upgrade your weapon to a certain masterwork level before you can begin to track kills. This is just another artificial roadblock that has been created for no reason. What if you had been using a gun for a long time but had never upgraded it? All of those kills will not be reflected once you do finally unlock the tracker. This means that the kill counter will not actually show the amount of enemies you have killed with that weapon, only the ones you killed after getting the tracker. This system doesn’t require a complete overhaul, as upgrading the weapon to see your kills is a fair enough trade, but it should be tweaked. If the gun automatically tracked your kills from the moment you picked it up, but only showed you that number once you upgrade it enough, then the kill count would be more accurate. Also, it would incentivize players to upgrade their weapons to see how many kills they have gotten with them.

Sorry for the long rant, this is just something that I’m really passionate about that I would love to see changed.",1615774455,2021-03-14 22:14:15

DestinyTheGame,Raid Idea: Dominion of the Witch Queen,"Before I actually write this, I want to clarify a few things. I'm not an avid raider. I've done 1 Eater of Worlds, 3 Deep Stone Crypts, and rage quit one time at the Sanctified Mind. I do enjoy thinking of exotic and raid ideas though, so I thought it'd be cool to create an idea for a raid. I'm not a developer or a loremaster, so I don't know if the story of this will actually make sense or the exotics be balanced, but I'll try my best. This is a raid idea for the Witch Queen expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: Our guardian, Shaxx, Eris, Drifter, and the Crow all began having headaches and hearing Savathun's voice. Our ghost manages to trace what's happening to an Ascendant portal, specifically a portal that's appeared at the Ahamkara bones near Shaxx. Our raid team launches in, and the first encounter begins.

First Encounter: The Labyrinth:

Upon launching in, the raid team is greeted by a massive doorway that leads to a large maze. You are able to jump on the walls of the maze, but the boss, Asher Mir, Taken Amalgam, will fire a big taken blast and kill them instantly. Our guardians will need to proceed carefully through the maze, because Taken Minotaurs are prowling the maze. If they see a guardian, they will heavily aggro them, which sucks, because any attack from the minotaurs will kill our guardian in a single blow. Guardians will have the choice of either trying to sneak past these minotaurs or fight them. Guardians will have to find 3 Radiolarian Infused Hive Larva scattered throughout the map. Radolarian Infused Hive Larva can be used as a trace rifle sort of weapon with infinite ammo, but they deal minimal damage to any enemy. The Larva deal massive damage to Asher's shield however. The main way of damaging Asher is grabbing the Larva and firing at his shields. If Asher's shield is damaged but not destroyed within 10 seconds, everyone wipes, so it's critical the fireteam coordinates and shoots him at the same time. Once his shield is down, the 3 guardians with the Larva get the Radiolarian Infused debuff, rendering them unable of firing the larva or dealing damage to Asher. The other 3 guardians do damage, before the maze reforms itself in a new configuration. The 3 guardians who don't have the debuff have to now run to their counterparts, pick up the Larva from them, and trigger another damage phase, while avoiding the minotaurs. When Asher's shield is broken, those with the debuff lose it, while those holding the Larva gain it. This process is repeated until Asher reaches a small portion of his health. At this point, Asher falls to the center of the maze, and the maze reforms to allow easy access to the center. Here, two platforms rise, one green, one red. Asher begs the guardians to kill him, and they have to vote. If it is a tie or a majority votes to spare Asher(Green), Asher regenerates and kills the team, wiping them. If all 6 vote to kill Asher, they are corrupted by the darkness and wipe. The only way to finish the encounter is for 1 or 2 guardians to vote to spare him, while the rest vote to kill him. The guardians who voted to save him get the debuff Heresy, while those who voted to kill him get the buff Worthy. Savathun manifests and kills Asher, before opening another portal for the guardians to go through. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the class item, boots, solar machine gun, and sidearm, and the exotic Warlock Gauntlets Asher Mir's Right Arm.

Second Encounter: Riven's Revenge

This is a jumping puzzle with vanishing platforms, similar to the ascendant challenges. Those with the Heresy debuff however have severely limited vision and would normally be unable to do the puzzle because they can't when the platforms are appearing or disappearing. It's then up to those with the Worthy buff to tell them when to and where to jump, guiding them through the puzzle. When they reach the end of the puzzle, those with the debuff will regain their vision. They will be on a large floating island, with columns of shriekers stretching upwards. Random shriekers will be glowing white, but this glow will only be visible to those with the Heresy debuff. Those with the debuff will start shooting the glowing shriekers. When the first shrieker is damaged, those with the debuff will begin to float upwards. If a shrieker that isn't glowing is shot, all the shriekers will aggro and make the encounter much harder. If those with the Heresy debuff reach the top of the Shrieker stack without killing every shrieker, the guardians wipe. Meanwhile, on the ground, those with the Worthy buff are rushed by a ton of shadow thralls and taken thralls and hive thralls. If the thralls make it to the shriekers, the shriekers will start to shoot. The raid team's main goal is to defend those with the Heresy Debuff. Once all the glowing shriekers are dead, the skeletal corpse of Riven will materialize and start chasing those with the Heresy Debuff. Everyone can damage Riven, but Riven deals 100% more damage and takes 100% more damage from those with the Heresy Debuff. Thralls will also continue to spawn. Riven has no mechanics to trigger damage, but he has a large amount of health and is fairly mobile, flying around the island. Once Riven is dead, a chest will spawn and a portal will open. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the gauntlets, hand cannon, pulse rifle, and Titan exotic leg armor Rotten Ahamkara Strides.

Third Encounter: Of Hated Nezarec

As our guardians pass through the portal, they are confronted by a massive Taken Orge, named Savathun's Taskmaster, in a massive cube similar to the 2nd Prophecy encounter, with small rectangles raised above the floor. As soon as they spawn in, Savathun's Taskmaster gets stomped, Tree of Probabilities style, by the true boss of this encounter, Nezarec's Shade. Players all become suppressed, unable to throw grenades, super, use charged melee's, or double jump. Void orbs fall from the ceiling, and one of the four cube walls will begin to glow. Guardians have to throw the orbs at the wall. If they hold the orbs for too long or let them sit on the floor, Nezarec wipes the raid team. Once 10 balls have hit the wall, it will shatter, and taken liquid will begin to seep through the cracks in the wall. Taken wizards with void shields will spawn. They can only be killed by hitting them with an orb. If 4 wizards spawn without dying, they'll banish Nezarec and wipe the raid team. The taken liquid serves as a timer. You have to go inside it to retrieve the balls, but it damages you, so you have to be quick and retreat back to higher ground. The more wizards there are, the faster the void balls spawn. If you kill the wizards as soon as they spawn, you won't have enough balls to break all four walls before the taken liquid fills the cube and kills everyone, forcing you to manage the number of wizards. Once a wall breaks, another will glow, and you'll have to break that one too. The more walls you break, the more the liquid flows in, and the less room for error. Once all for walls are shattered, Savathun manifests and battles Nezarec. Nezarec continues spawning orbs. You have to keep killing wizards, while also throwing the balls at each other. Once a guardian is hit by an orb, they regain their abilities for 30 seconds. You have to damage Savathun during this time, but kinetic weapons don't deal any damage. Only energy abilities and guns, with void weapons dealing 33% more damage. Once Savathun reaches half health, she'll retreat and leave behind a portal and a chest. Nezarec will praise the guardians and vanish. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the chest armor, void rocket launcher, void submachine gun, and the Hunter exotic chest piece, Nezarec's Blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Encounter: Savathun's Defeat

Our guardians enter the portal and are trapped in a large pit. Savathun gazes at them from above and commands them to fight. In this pit, pvp is enabled. The guardians fight each other, but instead of dying, when their health drops to zero, they are teleported into a cage. Everyone who is in a cage get's their buff/debuff changed to Heresy, and the lone survivor gets their buff/debuff changed to worthy. Once there is only one guardian left, the pit floor opens and they began to fall into a bottomless pit. As they fall, void orbs will begin to materialize in their hand, and they'll have to throw them at hive wizards hovering in the hole. Every time they hit a wizard, a cage will open, and a guardian up above will be able to escape. The guardians will then be able to interact with hive cryptoliths around the edge of the pit. If the Worthy player misses a wizard as they fall, and not all five cryptoliths are activated, Savathun triggers a wipe. Once all five have been interacted with, Savathun becomes damageable. The Worthy player teleports to the top of the pit and DPS begins. A random player becomes Worthy and the Worthy player gets the Heresy debuff instead. All players with Heresy get teleported into the cages and the Worthy player has to go back into the pit and kill all 5 wizards. This repeats until Savathun reaches final stand. Shriekers will spawn around the map. Those with Heresy will have to kill them, which will drop void orbs. The five Heresy guardians will have to throw the orbs at the Worthy guardian, buffing their damage by 5% for each orb. Like in the 3rd encounter, if an orb is left on the ground, everyone wipes. The Worthy player keeps shooting the boss until Savathun dies, ending the raid. The loot that can drop from this encounter is the helmet, arc wave-frame grenade launcher, and the exotic solar auto rifle Savathun's Flute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Loot: 

Armor: I'm not an artist, so I'll just say it'd be cool if it was hive-themed.

Weapons: The weapons from this raid can roll with 3 unique perks, 2 in the first column, 1 in the second column. The submachine gun can drop with a unique perk no other weapon can get.

First Perk: Larvae Rounds: Each bullet in this gun is infused with volatile hive cells. Bullets explode on impact and highlight the target. Can roll on the machine gun, sidearm, hand cannon, pulse rifle, and submachine gun. 

Second Perk: Lightdrinker: Kills give a small amount of energy to your class and super ability, and boosts energy weapon damage by 10% for 10 seconds. Can roll on all weapons.

Third Perk(Second Column): Worthy's Gaze: Aiming down sights for a short period empowers your gun, making it stun Unstoppable Champions.

Fourth Perk(Second Column): Nezarec's Praise: When taking void damage, your damage increases by 30% and you regain all your health on a kill. This can only roll on the submachine gun.

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Warlock Gauntlet: Asher Mir's Right Arm:

Intrinsic: Radiolarian Infusion: Melee kills briefly maximize your discipline, strength, mobility, resilience, and recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Titan Leg Armor: Rotten Ahamkara Strides: 

Intrinsic: Foul Aura: Sliding near an enemy briefly suppresses and misdirects them(They can't use abilities and lose their radar.)

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Hunter Chestpiece: Nezarec's Blessing

Intrinsic: Pain God's Gift: Void ability kills refresh your void abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Exotic Auto Rifle: Savathun's Flute

Intrinsic: Viral Rounds: Targets hit by this gun take poison damage and are slowed.

Secondary Perk: Befoul the Earth: Kills with this weapon leave behind a stationary Remnant. Hold \[reload\] to teleport back to your Remnant, consuming it. You can only have one Remnant at a time.

DestinyTheGame,You cant fucking win in Gambit with randoms,"I've been grinding Gambit for the past 3 hours and I've won about half the time. Those times were when I used thundercrash + cuirass, even though I main Sentinel. I know this is just white noise at this point, but I can't even right now. I need to get 40 fucking kills for my dredgen seal, and I cant even do that! Every type I get an optimal add type, my teammates are fucking glue eaters, and even when I clear 90% of the adds, I still die because the are all waiting by the invade portal.

Then when I try to play properly, all they seem to do is want to clear adds. So I invade, get hella kills, and then we lose because I cant thundercrash the boss and my teammates die before they can bank their whole 15 motes, when we need like 8. Then when i try to help clear adds, we summon a primeval in team, but the enemy team is way to quick due to no opposition in the form of invades. It's nearly impossible.

I know how it can be frustrating to just want to do the Raid with no issues but people want to learn also and I hope there is some groups willing to help out. Once people learn that's just more people willing to help others.

DestinyTheGame,Special ammo economy,"  I've seen a good amount of posts here recently about how strong our special weapons are and how specific perks need to be removed from archetypes (QD on high impact shotguns). And while I understand the frustration of being aped the whole match I feel a change to the ammo economy would be better suited than gutting entire archetypes of perks that make them feel good to use. 
 
   My thoughts would be to get rid of special ammo drops on kill. Instead a player would spawn in with two or three shots and in order to get more ammo you'd be required to get a set amount of kills let's say five for an example.  After five kills you get a shot back and our scavenger mods can be reworked to add an additional shot just as the do now. A system like this is already in place with PvE since you can get ammo back if you're completely out with all weapons in specific activities. I'm not a dev and I have no idea how hard the coding would be but I personally feel like this is a better route to take instead of nerfing special weapons into the ground or going the crate route from D1 and I feel like this would be a better direction for the state of PvP.  People could still use their favorite weapons while also rewarding primary gunfights and avoid the possibility of someone running around with 12 felwinters shots the whole game or at least lessen the possibility.",1615770679,2021-03-14 21:11:19

DestinyTheGame,"Hey Bungie, can we talk for a second?","I want to give you more of my money. The problem is you have made doing that slightly more difficult for myself, and other guardians. 

I am talking specifically about the Triumph seal pin for the current season.

Before moving on, for those unaware, each seal that has been introduced since Forsaken, has had a real life version made available on [Bungiestore.com](https://bungiestore.com/collections/whats-new/products/preorder-bungie-rewards-chosen-seal-collectible-medallion-pin). Normally the pin ""retails"" for $777,777.77 USD, but if you earn the seal in game, you'll get a code from bungie rewards that allows you to buy it for its actual price of $20+ USD.

The issue is this, the seal requires that we have too obtain all the logs for the ""Bound in memory"" triumph, but you have set it so only one log can be earned a each week. Meaning we if miss a week, we are a fucked out of obtaining the code for the pin. That honestly feels shitty, and comes off as a weird level of FOMO.

I'll continue playing the season and going for the seal, in hopes that you guys decide to alter this, I wont hold my breath though. 

&amp;#x200B;

And before someone comes at me saying ""well maybe you shouldn't have skipped a week"", I was in the hospital for part of week 3 of presage. When I got out, I just didn't have the energy to commit to playing for a few days. The last thing on my mind was the seal/pin.",1615769909,2021-03-14 20:58:29

From what I've seen, the buff starts half way through a slide and lasts just over a second after the slide is finished. I have found that while this is strong, it often only lasts the first shot of a fight. Why not just opening shot then? Just adding one more second would make this top teir. Even adding a timer would help players work with it a bit more.

But last night my group of friends and I got together and did DSC as a big group before the bug goes away. Our clan isn't big - it's about 15 to 20 active people at absolute peak, usually closer to 10 - but it was the *first time* we've ever been able to really group together and do something, all at the same time. We got our first clan photo that wasn't just the six people who beat any given raid.

Not only that, but after we killed Taniks, we stuck around right until we were kicked out - throwing supers around stupidly, showing sparrows off, and just goofing. It was nice to have a space where we COULD show our sparrows to each other in a big group - something that the tower doesn't offer, even though it's our social space. It reminded me of WoW or FFXIV, where you can see people just gathered around on their mounts - it creates this weird sense of cool, and lets people show the stuff they've gotten in the game off (outside of just armor and titles).

I know Bungie's been collecting a lot of feedback and data specifically around the 12 man activities, but I wanted to specifically call out the non-gameplay benefits of just being able to group up with more friends - because I think they're just as important to making Destiny a game people always want to come back to.

Imagine a legacy item quest that allowed me to play and win modern trials matches (not in a row), plus a few other objectives, that then allowed me to obtain a 46 stat roll ""Vest of the Exile"". *(The reason the stat roll isn't important is because of transmog)*

For guns it could give the curated roll or a predetermined roll depending on how kind bungie wants to be. One last note is that the devs could also allow players to select extra grindy or extra difficult modifiers on the legacy item quest to get better rolls on different items.

DestinyTheGame,"I think besides a few expections, Titan subclasses are all viable with the right build","This is just my personal opinion but honestly I’m liking where Titans are at right now. Yes this usually requires mods or exotics and master-worked armor to do so, but I’d argue most subclasses are actually fine. Now all of these aren’t 10/10 but I’d argue they have uses. Let me use Titan because that’s my wheel house. Also this is PVE only really, as PvP will likely never have all 10 subclass trees good at one time. 

Void: 
Top Tree: it’s bubble, every boss encounter you are asked if the group has a bubble. It is nice that middle tree solar warlock had well so it’s not as mandatory as it was in D1 but glad to see it in D2 as an option. 

Middle Tree: An intellect build with Ursa Furiosa actually puts this as a top tier choice for GMs. You always have a super and a safe way to get buffed damage on targets.

Bottom Tree: Using Doomfangs this becomes a really good add clear super, maybe not the best but a good option. It gives Sentinel Shield more range use and that’s always good.

Solar: 
Top Tree: This might be my least used tree out of the three just because of the other two trees offer a little bit more. The super can have a large blast radius but in high level content it would at best be used to target one yellow health mob. Melting point just isn’t where it used to be with other option but if it’s what you got it isn’t horrible.

Middle Tree: Now I know what you are thinking, this super is cool but sucks in practice. I personally love using this subclass tree, yeah it probably needs the most love out of all of the trees but if built correctly it can be awesome. I use hallowfire heart and wreck with grenades and the hammer, it’s hilarious seeing the hammer take a quarter of a yellow health bar. I use hallowfire because you are likely not going to use this super often as it isn’t the strongest option in higher level content and can leave you vulnerable. If the super sees a buff it could be much more useful. 

Bottom Tree: For sure the strongest Titan build for add clear to me, Phoenix Cradle can allow you and your teammates to burn stuff for days. Also use some warming cells to add even more flames to the fun. 

Arc: 
Top Tree: Alright I know I said all are good but honestly unless you want two grenades without using Armamentarium, then this have no major advantage over bottom tree, I guess if you wanted to spam heavy attacks to have tick damage on a boss you could but at that point use middle tree with Cuirass of the Falling Star. The best build I see for this is Skullfort and infinite shoulder charge in lower level content but if you don’t get a kill in high level stuff you are screwed. 

Middle Tree: Speaking of which, this is my favorite super, hands down. I liked it before the new exotic. If you want pure boss damage use cuirass as that probably is more viable. If you want to constantly have a fist of havoc, use skullfort to clear mobs and have fun with that melee! 

Bottom Tree: This was my go to add clear for some time, using skullfort ensures you will never need to worry about a melee charge time so you can spec into other stats. Also the super lasts a long time as long as you are clearing those adds. 

Stasis: 
Behemoth
Alright I may catch downvotes for this opinion but it’s probably the weakest in pve among its Hunter and Warlock buddies. It’s slow and clunky, and burns through super energyt trying to clear mobs. I get it, freezing stuff is cool, but if you were using bottom tree Striker they’d be dead and you wouldn’t need them frozen. That’s just my opinion tho. 

I’m no expert but I had three Titans in D1 and didn’t have other characters besides a Titan in D2 until shadowkeep. This is probably the best spot they have ever been in, but hopefully some of the lesser supers get buffed.",1615765149,2021-03-14 19:39:09

DestinyTheGame,There is nothing more insulting than Running 10+ Master Lost Sectors and receiving 2 Exotics and 5 Masterwork Cores. (Lost Sector Rant and Tips),"I've been hunting for some good Ashen Wakes and between yesterday and today I've been grinding Lost Sectors.

I've learned a few things from this experience.

1. On Legend, Exotics drop about 1 in 8 to 1 in 10 Platinum runs. The longest drought I went without any Exotics was 15 runs.

2. Go for Platinum. You probably can recieve Exotics from lower but it must be a much, much lower chance. There were times where I was on 1 rez and I couldn't be bothered with a Champion so I went for Boss. I did not get an Exotic in any of these runs.

3. Overload Champions SUCK. Since Beyond Light dropped in November Overloads in general seem to stun and immediately unstun way more often than before. This season I'd recommend Le Monarque for them thís season. 

Barrier and Unstoppables aren't as bad. The only problems I've had with them are Barrier Champs coming out of their Barriers but this is easily remedied by shooting them ASAP. Unstoppables will unstun if affected by Stasis, so keep that in mind. 

4. Unless you are at LEAST 5 over the Master recommended Light Level don't bother with them. More, fast runs with slightly lower odds are better than less, slow runs with moderate odds. 

In Legend you're also less likely to break your controller because the BARRIER CHAMP WON'T STOP SHIELDING THE F&amp;#KING OVERLOAD. 

5. Try to use weapons and mods you like. The  AntiChampion Mods this season are on weapons that a lot of people don't like. Use weapons that are closer to your own playstyle. You like Autos but not Scouts? Try a Trustee. Personally, I enjoy using Snipers and Bows for Barrier and Overload and Sniper and Devils Ruin for Unstoppables and Barries.

6. Take breaks. You will get burnt out. Don't try push through. Do something else. Altars of Sorrow. Dance at the Tower.

Rant time. 

Bungie really needs to up drop chances for Master. Like a lot. I hate posts like these but there needs to be some light at the end of the tunnel for these things. Every time I open that boss chest and see and Enhancement Core a little piece of me dies. 

What's worse is the Exotics I did get were at most 62s with terrible stat distribution. I want me Exotics to have spiky stats. Not looking like flat wall I'm banging my head against.

DestinyTheGame,Is there really a point to keep vaulting stuff at this point???,"I uderstantd why vaulting even started in the first place and i supported the idea initialy (i think waaaaay too much stuff left for the new light’s) but here are my issues with keeping it going

1. After the first month after Beyond Light release the game became depressingly boring due to general lack of content (don’t even justify season of the hunt it was garbage) and until Witch Queen all seasonal content is gonna leave. If Bungie would Vault more stuff the game would just get too empty to keep Playing even considering new content in wich queen.

2. Forsaken is the biggest DLC ever released that already got hit by DCV and honestly i can’t imagine losing Last Wish and spider’s shop

3. Isn’t Bungie like expanding 3x times??? OK now saying they can’t sustain this game while not vaulting is just ridicoulous 

4. New light experience is already trash. As a new light player you can’t get any idea what game is about because you can only do bounties and have no story to be motivated by. If they Vault Forsaken this will get even worse with a bit of bounties leaving and story wich if they watched Cayde 6 compilation they could give less of a fuck about.

Im not here saying that they should insta unvault everything because that is just insane demand. But stuff shouldn’t leave anymore.",1615763266,2021-03-14 19:07:46
DestinyTheGame,"An idea for a ""fun"" challenge","I know a lot of people have already reached Rank 100 and are just waiting for more content, so if you need something to do to bide the time, I've got a challenge for you.  The challenge is to reach season rank 100 entirely from the Cosmodrome (with an exception).  

How to get started:

* First, make a new F2P account on Steam, Xbox, Playstation, etc.
* OPTIONAL: Purchase the season pass.  You don't have to, as it may be considered a waste of money, but it will speed up the challenge

What is allowed:

* Any content in the Cosmodrome including bounties, patrols, New Light quest, lost sectors (including legend and master), and strikes (including the Disgraced, Devil's Lair, and Fallen SABER Nightfalls)
* The Tower and the HELM
* Quests that are required for the seasonal artifact.  This season requires you to do the first battleground on Nessus to get the artifact.  You can go there to get the artifact but that's it.
* Multiple characters are allowed and recommended to speed this up
* Seasonal challenges that can be completed in the Cosmodrome or its strikes.
* Tower/HELM bounties that can be completed in the Cosmodrome or its strikes
* You can visit Xur IF he is in the Tower
* You can play with others as long as you follow the challenges' rules while doing so

What isn't allowed:

* Traveling to the EDZ, Nessus (except for the case above), Tangled Shore, Dreaming City, Moon, or Europa and/or any activities associated with those locations.  
* Playlist strikes, Crucible, Gambit, dungeons, raids, Presage
* Cosmodrome Battleground.  Even though it's in the Cosmodrome you have to do the Europa battleground to unlock it.
* Deleting characters.  You could theoretically delete characters and remake them to repeatedly do bounties.  Do the challenge legitimately.

The goal:

* Reach season rank 100 under these requirements

I highly doubt anyone will actually do this, but its just something that I came up with tonight.  If you do decide to do this, have fun with Shaw Han.",1615763136,2021-03-14 19:05:36

back when the dexterity mods where apart of the legs, the arms although slightly less populated then other Armor pieces, it gave a type of balance between scavengers and dexterity, would you pick more ammo or greater ease of use. and in PvP this was an important choice 

and with the cost of non primary champion mods being upwards of 6 energy, in my mind it doesn't fit that there is such a high density of mods on the arms

Just because this bad luck spree happens to minority of the playerbase does not make it okay either.

Please Bungie, its 2021. Give dedicated raiders some bad luck protection. They paid for the expansion that released in November and still haven't got the exotic? How the heck is this okay? Do you think anyone likes being disappointed every week 3 times for 5 months? Seriously this sort of drop mechanism is outdated and makes me genuinely upset.

DestinyTheGame,When In Doubt Nerf Hunters Some More,"Hunters have received the most nerfs in the life span of the Destiny 2. But if a hunter makes a post about being nerfed, we don't get 1.7k upvotes about it. 

Solar hunters got crapped on with nerfs over the years. The only good thing is the throwing knife and people want that nerfed even more! ""Blade barrage is strong"" nova bomb is better and does more damage and tracks, then creates mini nova bombs that track after. 

Arc hunters neutral game might be the weakest in the game, the tree nodes all got nerfed back in the day. Bungie reason for it this was ""they were used more then the other nodes"". Middle tree reflect uses up so much super its stupid. Its a melee super but its so slow, nova warp can close the gap so much faster and has an aoe attack. Nova Warp is better then Arc Strider. 

Void hunters.... Do I have to mention how bad Tether is, or is that already clear? Middle tree super is the only good thing about void hunters in pvp. But that subclass got nerfed over and over, people still want it nerfed again. ""Crouching headshots give wallhacks"" I would agree with you, but Bungie nerfed the crap out of that. 

Stasis hunters ""insane tacking on its melee"" The crazy tracking is not from the first initial throw but after it hits something. You still have to mostly aim, its not an aoe explosion like warlock stasis that insta freezes then tracks to something else to insta freeze. After the nerf, 2 melees wont even freeze you.  Shatterdive, a two step process for a grenade to kill you. let me repeat, 2 step process for a GRENADE to kill you! That got nerfed into the ground, but Titans shatterslide, its 2 step process to kill didnt get tounched. Shatterslide is way stronger, lets them slide crazy far, twice! And their slide shatters any crystals or frozen targets.  Stasis hunter super is actually bad over all, its insta freeze is the only thing good about it. You jump and hang in the air with very little damage rez to throw 2 things. A lot of the time hunters dont get to throw the tornado, but when they do, it gets stuck on a wall or a stair. Its so bad, I might as well use Tether.  

At the start of Beyond Light, Hunters dodge cooldown got a nerf across the board just because. No reason given, just Bungie wanted to.  Stop nerfing Hunters!",1615760426,2021-03-14 18:20:26

DestinyTheGame,Frags of rasputin &amp; Lance,"First of all, pardon my english!

Alright, are you titans ready to spam some sun spots and grenades? This build focuses on the fact that you can create sun spots and those lovely warmind cells with polaris lance. And believe me, you're going to swim in those sun spots!
Ait let's break it down!

Subclass:
Bottom tree hammer titan. Sunspots and health regenration are the key.

- You are able to throw a LOT of grenades.
- You are able to pierce barrier champions shield and deal with one other champion type depending of your kinetic weapon!
- You are able to heal yourself by getting kills with solar abilities. (Dunno if the lance works on this since it can create sun spots.)
- Sun warrior gives bonus to weapon damage. (+20%)
- Your abilities recharge really fast thanks to elemental wells and Hallowfire heart exotic chest.
- You can run low intellect and focus on other stats thanks to the font of wisdom.

Weapons:

Kinetic
- anything really, high dps sniper or shotty or somethong to deal with champions

Energy
- Polaris lance baby (or Ticuu's divination or any solar splash damage weapon but no, for the love for lance)

Heavy
- Sola's scar with chain reaction perk (code duello would do as well or any solar splash heavy if that matter)

Armor:

Helmet - any energy type
- Global reach (1 energy) (must)
- 2x ammo finders (2-6 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (I use dicipline)

Arms - solar
- Elemental ordnance (3 energy)
- Anti-barrier scout rifle (1 energy)
- Impact induction or other champion mod (1-3 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (discipline)

Hallowfire heart - any energy type
- Font of wisdom (4 energy)
- Any resistance mod (1 energy)
- Sword reserves (2 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (discipline)

Legs - solar
- Burning cells (I don't have rage of the warmind) (3 energy)
- 2x scavengers (2-6 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy) (...)

Class - solar
- Wrath of rasputin (1 energy)
- 2x bomber (4 energy)
- Stat increase (3 energy)

Ait about the playstyle. SLAY. Throw a ton of frags, pick up elemental well and stand on the sunspot. Lance adds and those who die to dragonfly or the perfect fift explosion will create sunspots. You can literally spam your abilities and create those sweet sweet warmind cells. Your heavy can clear out big groups of adds at a time. For boss damage use heavy or kinetic of your choice. Succession with vorpal and reconstrucion is pretty darn good.

TL;DR
Use the weapons and armor mods listed earlier and slay throught any activity. And have fun.

Make sure to read my earlier hunter lance build as well. Cheers guardians!",1615758599,2021-03-14 17:49:59

I want to keep grinding but I now know nothing is going to drop for me. And yes, I am getting platinum and doing them in under 15 minutes.

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, please give us the option to pick and choose what planets we want to have downloaded. Please do not remove Forsaken!","This is what the DCV should be! Picking and choosing what destinations we want downloaded like mini dlc packs. Many of us are so over vaulting locations, stories, strikes, and raids that we love to play. If Bungie is so concerned about space then they should let the players choose how much they want at once

Losing Forsaken would be a death-blow to the game. It is the best content that Destiny 2 has had to offer and maybe even better than any location Bungie has ever created(Looking at you Dreaming City). 

Not to mention it was $40 and removing that plus the $60 from the base game is just a kick to the gut to veteran players. I can’t even imagine if I couldn’t go back to some classic D1 locations, strikes, or raids in the first game.

DestinyTheGame,What kind of game modes should bungie add into crucible?,"Personally, ive found crucible to be very stale for quite some time. New subclasses and metas shake it up but were still playing on the same maps and game modes over and over. 

Im not game developer, but i do see other studios cranking out new game modes for their arena shooters on a regular basis.

Having said this, I’m curious what kind of game modes the destiny community is interested in seeing lord shaxx bring to the crucible. Would love to hear your best ideas for game modes in the comments. Here’s a few of my favorite ideas:

Golden Guardians:
Players have the ability to equip exotic loot in all slots. The builds... they would be a sight to behold

Target Practice:
Super, grenade, melee, and class abilities are locked. Give us that pure arena style shooter

Class based warfare:
A playlist that fills lobbies based on your class. This means a 6v6 lobby of only titans, hunters, or warlocks. Bubble titans go brrr

Finally i think destiny’s mechanics are just so satisfying that a lot of game modes from first person shooters would work great in this game. Take hardpoint from COD as an example, would force us to engage in unorthodox parts of the map.",1615757744,2021-03-14 17:35:44

DestinyTheGame,My idea for the witch queen raid. Please give your thoughts and opinions,"1st Encounter-  All 6 gaurdians have to stand on an individual hive rune to unlock the door. During this encounter immune Knights will shoot at them at a height. At the halfway point of the rune completing their shields will drop and the gaurdians will have a limited time to kill all of them. Failure to do so will result in a wipe.

2nd Encounter- A giant maze that has Giant Knights wielding axes. Each player has a knight that chases them through the maze. There are 6 starting paths. At certain points paths will cross and the gaurdians will be able to stun eachothers Knights. Causing them to drop a relic. Once all relics have been collected the gaurdians will lead all of the Knights back to the middle and make them group up. All gaurdians will have to throw the relics at the Knights to cause them to be damagable to all players. Faliure to kill all of them will repeat the maze process with less Knights.

3rd Encounter- An Immune Ogre boss will spawn in the center of the room. Ads will spawn after and once all ads have been killed a random gaurdian will be selected. 6 doors will open on the sides and the selected gaurdian is the only one who can see the real door to go through. Once all gaurdians have gone through the door they will be teleported into different rooms. In each room there will be another ogre that they must kill. Failure to kill all ogres will result in their being a much shorter damage window for the main boss. Once all ogres have been killed the gaurdians will be teleported back to the main boss and be able to damage it. At random the boss eye will start to glow a bright red and only one gaurdian can see it happening. That gaurdian will have to shoot the eye to stun the ogre. Failure to do so will result in a wipe.

4th Encounter- A massive debris field is the only way to get across a gap. One gaurdian will have to stand in a rune to see the true path and guide the rest of the team over. Once the 5 gaurdians are across. They'll have to stand in runes to keep the path open for the lone gaurdian, but while they're keeping the path open thrills will constantly rush at them. 

5th Encounter- Boss- I hive wizard with 8 tentacles on its back will spawn in.  It will be immune. Ads will spawn in as well as immune Knights from the second Encounter. Once all ads have been defeated each gaurdian will be teleported in to their own room with one of the Knights. The room will be pitch black and the knight will constantly rush the gaurdian. When the Knights raises the axe to attack the gaurdian has to shoot the Knights arm to stun them. Once all Knights have been stunned, they will all become damageable and each gaurdian has to kill their knight. Failure to do so will cause the Knights to be there during boss damage phase. Once all Knights have been killed the gaurdians will be teleported back to the boss room and able to damage the wizard. At random the wizard will stab at the gaurdians with the tentacles and they will have to dodge them. After 7 seconds the bottom tentacles will wrap around one gaurdian and lift them in the air. This gaurdian will then see 2 of the other 6 tentacles and have to tell the other gaurdians which tentacles to shoot. Success will result in another 7 second damage phase. Failure to do so will result in a wipe. 

Final stand- Once the boss has reached final stand each gaurdian will be teleported back into their own room with their own boss. They will have to damage the boss but at random one gaurdians boss will have 2 tentacles glowing and call out which ones. All 5 other gaurdians will have to shoot those tentacles on their boss. Failure to do so will result in a wipe. One all 6 gaurdians have seen the tentacles glow and shot all of them. All of the tentacles will glow and become weak spots. Once all tentacles have been destroyed the boss will teleport the gaurdians back to the main room and be very weak. Once the boss is killed a door will open in the back of the Encounter and the chest for loot will be there.",1615756968,2021-03-14 17:22:48

DestinyTheGame,Giving shotguns a consistent pellet pattern might be the way to finally get them balanced.,"Before you downvote because ""shotgun ape bad"", just take a second and consider the points I'm making.

Felwinter's is the most used PvP shotgun by far. Why? Because it has a consistent pellet spread and quickdraw, and was relatviely easy to get. I'm not going to discuss quickdraw in this post, that's for another time.

People are calling for Felwinter's to be either turned into an exotic or nerfed heavily because of just these two attributes. 

That said, **what if we gave every shotgun a fixed pellet pattern**? It doesn't have to be a perfect circle like Felwinter's, it just has to be the **same pattern every time**. Maybe make each shotgun frame have a different pattern. Once you remove the RNG component of shotgun range, it becomes much easier to balance them properly. 

If the spread is consistent, the falloff/range can be adjusted until shotguns are in the place they need to be balance wise. You'd (theoretically) have far fewer moments where you either get mapped or whiff your shotgun shots, adding consistency to the experience at both ends.

For an example of what I'm talking about, look at CS:GO. That game is basically the polar opposite of Destiny in that shotguns were basically useless because of great ranged options (rifles) and slow movement.

A year or two ago, they removed random pellet spread entirely. They gave every shotgun in the game a unique, **fixed** pellet pattern, and removed RNG from the equation for ranged kills. They left in the movement and jumping inaccuracy, but that is more of a CS:GO concept, less of a Destiny one. Now, shotguns are in a better place than ever before, and have a proper niche in the meta. They aren't OP, but they aren't ignored completely. 

Just some thoughts that came to mind.",1615755642,2021-03-14 17:00:42

DestinyTheGame,Bring back old pvp rewards pls Bungie,"So I think we can all admit that sunsetting was a ""fix"" for specific weapons (Mountaintop, Revoker, Recluse). In a post sunsetting world I think that Bungie should bring back our old beloved pvp weapons. It would breath life back to the pvp playlists like comp (since players might actually have a reason to participate in it). Could even just make them (or the original trials of the nine weapons) after match rewards in Trials. 

What if you could earn skins for these weapons through playing comp if you already have them? Or even some new random rolls?   


1. At this point is there any reason we shouldn't be able to use Luna's Howl or Not Forgotten? 
2. Is there a reason we can't get a recluse with a modified version of Master of Arms (or even a different perk entirely? Or Random rolls?). 
3. Revoker at its core would always break ammo economy so it would need a new perk as a replacement. 
4. Redrix might need a new set of perks since people would have grinded for their pervious rolls (although Messenger seems strictly better so could just increase infusion cap).  
5. Leave Mountaintop gone for good. (I hate nade launchers in pvp. I dont think any pvp players would be happy to see Mountaintop ever again) 

I don't like reissuing gear at all. However, this could be a low effort (low time investment) thing that Bungie could do to help PvP even a little bit. Since it is reissuing (to some degree) Bungie should be able to make these changes faster than creating entirely new stuff with new identities.   


This doesn't solve the problems with pvp at all. Stasis is still a problem (probably still will be after the nerfs). It also doesn't solve the problems with the comp or trials playlists....but it at least gives people an incentive to play pvp.",1615753981,2021-03-14 16:33:01

DestinyTheGame,Speculation: The new location in Witch Queen will be Torobatl which has been turned into a Hive War 'Moon',"This is pure speculation. Destiny will likely never actually leave the Solar System, and with the number of places in the system yet to be explored dwindle, as well as the desire to actually see alien worlds, I feel we will get just this in Witch Queen.

A War Moon in general makes a lot of sense, with another potential location being the Ammonite moon that use to orbit Fundament and was confirmed to be a War Moon. However, with Xivu Arath having recently confirmed to have conquered the planet and the Cabal fleeing it, it would be the ultimate show of strength if the Hive then arrive in our solar system with a corrupted Torobatl being their largest war moon ever (At that point, the term moon is hardly fitting).

This would fit with Caiatl's desire of reconquering her home world with out help while also justifying why they have such a heavy involvement. Personally, Torobatl looking very Roman but in ruins would offer many opportunities and is an exciting prospect.  

Lastly, while I know there has never really been planets turned into war Moons, the power of the Hive seems stronger than ever now. 

I would also like to add that we will also likely get a new Cabal and Hive enemy type in witch Queen in the same vein of how we get a new Vex (wyvern) and Fallen (brig) enemy type.",1615753494,2021-03-14 16:24:54

I've always criticised Bungies decisions and dropped off the game more than warlocks have dropped off a platforming puzzle but its always been one of my favourite games and hosted some of my favourite gaming memories. I dropped off again after Beyond Light but heard this season was good so jumped back in and...

Oh my, the story telling feels like its improved tenfold, the missions (Presage) are stellar, the seasonal activity is fun and having finally gone back and done DSC, I loved it. In the process of trying to convince my old fireteam to return to the game I've realised the value that D2 really has now.

DestinyTheGame,Suggesting for Raid Guided Games w More than 6,"From doing several raids 10-12 man over the last few weeks, it has become glaringly obvious that is it much easier to teach mechanic heavy raids when you can have a newbie “shadow” someone performing a specific job.  We ran a Garden run for Divinity with 9 people, and it went so smoothly.  But even more importantly, we could teach the newbies what the jobs were without the frustration of wiping to sacs every few minutes.  The new people were able to watch and ask questions, without the weight of the raid on their shoulders.  I will sometimes stream a raid before sherpaing, so that the newbies can see what is supposed to be happening without the pressure, but this worked even better.  Just an idea that I think more people would do guided games for raids or dungeons (both as guides and blueberries), if we were able to take a few extra people.  This is way better than raid carries, because the kindergaurdians are able to actually learn the position, rather than being tasked with “stand over here, kill ads, don’t get in the way”, and having no idea what was actually happening.

DestinyTheGame,Season of the Wolves [Fan-Made Season],"Howdy, I was bored and I wanted to feel creative so I came up with a fan made season that would give us a taste of Rise of Iron in D2. However, the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to make it affect Iron Banner as well. This post will be lengthy so TL;DR will be at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

***Prologue***: Season of the Divide starts with reports of SIVA being found on New Light Guardians (this will actually affect New Light Players) so we must investigate it. Before we go further, I want to make the community to experience the Owl Sector event that took place before Rise of Iron by making any player who started playing when Beyond Light start the spread of SIVA to all players. Encountering them in the tower, Strikes, Crucible, Gambit and Public Spaces will spread it or you can encounter by doing to the Divide and investigating SIVA nodes near the Exodus Garden lost sector. This then would send you to the Helm to avoid bringing it into the Last City where Saladin reaches out through a call. Saladin is angered to see SIVA back and wants to send an army to once again end SIVA while it is only on Earth (for now). 

&amp;#x200B;

***Enter the Guardian***: Our seasonal activity will send us to a familiar place from The Dark Below, a revamped version of the ""Siege of the Warmind"" where we discover Ana and Rasputin fighting against SIVA Cabal and Fallen with Ana switching between Statis and Gunslinger while Rasputin is creating Warmind Cells to use against SIVA as well as his robots from Season of the Worthy. Here we discover that Cabal who don't want to side with Empress Caiatl made an alliance with the remaining army of the House of Salvation whom want to takedown the so called ""Great Machine"" with anything they can get their hands on. Together the Cabal and Fallen becomed SIVA'd to become more than once before, thinking they have control now. Upon ending the mission, Rasputin and Ana fill up the gap between Beyond Light and now telling us that Rasputin has a new and improved version of SIVA which we can control and destroy with the power of Rasputin which brings us to our New Combat mod system, Nanite Null.

&amp;#x200B;

***Nanite Null***: Unlike Warmind Cells, Nanite Null is purely based of the Seasonal Weapons and new seasonal Exotic Armor as well as Outbreak Perfected ***to increase its endgame usage*** (looking at Sleeper Simulant). Nanite Null works in 3 different ways: Control, Support and Execution.

* Control causes enemies affected by Nanite Null to stop SIVA grenades from being thrown
* Support causes benefits to the player and Nanite Null abilities
* Executions causes Nanite Null to be lethal

Players will combine different forms of Control, Support and Execution to give Nanite Null a directive that it will continue to do until told otherwise (this is a reference to a gilmore card from Destiny 1).

&amp;#x200B;

Here are examples of 3 forms of Control, Support and Execution.

Control:

* **Leadership**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Null weapons look for the nearest mini-boss or boss
* **Recall**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Null weapons mini-boss and majors search for rank and file enemies
* **Redirect**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Null search for the nearest enemy

Support:

* **Spread**\- Enemies affected by Natine Null will spread Natine Null to others upon death
* **Weaken-** Enemies affected by Natine Null will take 15% damage extra from all sources for 
* **Rally-** Enemies affected by Nanite Null will grant ability energy and have an increased chances to create ammo for allies

Execution:

* **Autonomous**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Control attack whoever they searched for. When 3 enemies are killed by Autonomous, you become Charged with Light x2. Enemies attacked by Control enemies will deal more damage to Controlled enemies.
* **Decompose**\- Enemies affected by Nanite Control will cause DoT to whoever they searched. When 3 enemies are killed by Decompose, an elemental well will spawn matching your subclass. Decompose will do increased damage to the original target and will weaken as the original loses health.
* **Destructors-** Enemies affected by Nanite Control will cause enemies to exploded once they are near 3 of the enemies they searched for. The stronger the enemy controlled, the stronger the explosion. If 5 enemies are killed by Destructors, create a Warmind Cell. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Seasonal Activities***: This seasonal will include multiple activites with one including a new space on a SIVA'd Fallen Ketch. This Ketch would be the secret mission that allows the players to unlock a new Exotic Void Heavy Sniper. The six man seasonal matchmade activity will similar to the first encounter of Wrath of the Machine for the different weekly bosses, but will work like Battlegrounds with a series of objects where the player faces SIVA'd Cabal and Fallen. 2 New Lost Sectors have been added from the EDZ which will be available at all times however you must be at the previous season's max level to enter as well as these lost sectors will have champions with contest mode. The 2 Lost Sectors used will be The Pit as well as The Flooded Chasm which will be SIVA'd.

&amp;#x200B;

***Seasonal Weapon Rewards***: To have Nanite Null, we need to have the weapons for it which will be acquired from SIVA Sectors and the matchmade activity.

Weapons will include:

* **CHAOS DOGMA\~**: This Scout will be returning with random rolls, but does have a curated roll earned from the SIVA Sector that drops it that day. This weapon will be Arc matching the exotic version and it would come with Triple Double along side a new perk called **And Repeat** which causes any extra rounds gained to do 30% extra damage
* **QUANTIPLASM\~**: This Shotgun would run to us as a Void Shotgun and its curated roll would improve on its raid version. This roll would make Battle Runner into a perk that grants armor and speed as well as a new perk called **Full Stop** which grants Overshield after stunning an Unstoppable
* **STEEL MEDULLA\~** This Pulse would be in the kinetic slot. The curated roll will have Sign of Four like the original as well as a **Overflowing Light** which gives this gun the chance to make you and your allies Charged with Light after getting precision kills on combatants
* **EX MACHINA\~** This sniper would return as an Arc weapon and its curated roll returns will have Alloy Mag, Clown Cartridge and Triple Double
* **NANOCHAOTIC\~** One of the first two new heavy weapons would be a Solar Linear Fusion Rifle where its curated roll has 2 new perks: **Firing Squad** and **Swarm**. Firing Squads allows you to rapid fire your linear like the SIVA Wire Rifles in D1 after getting a precision kill. Swarm grants a 30% damage buff against all Nanite Null enemies after getting 3 headshots with any weapon
* **ANDROID DIRECTIVE\~** The second heavy weapons is a Void grenade launcher which a curated combo meant for endgame. The roll would have **Blinding Light** and **SIVA Clusters**. Unlike all Nanite Null Weapons, this weapon in its curated roll does not require a kill to activate Nanite Null.

***Seasonal Exotic Armor and Weapons***: SIVA Sectors will be the way you earn new SIVA Exotic Armor as well, but there is an exotic ornament earned in Iron Banner for them (More on that later). There is also 3 exotic weapons coming, 2 from Destiny 1 and the New One is from the Secret Mission, each will have a catalyst.

**Armor**:

* **Jolder's Heart:** Void Detonators turn into SIVA Nanites causing Overload and debuffs enemies (20%) to SIVA or Nanite Null weapons.
* **Felwinter's Core:** Blink turns into a horizontal teleport (like SIVA captains) and enemies near the Blink get trapped by SIVA Nanites temporary. Killing trapped enemies grants extra armor and melee damage.
* **Gheleon's Wish:** Swarm Grenades causes Overload and become SIVA Nanites. Kills with the Nanites will cause more Nanites to spawn. (Similar to how Thorn and Necrotic Grips work, Outbreak and this chest will work together)

**Weapons:**

* Season Pass Exotic will be Dreg's Curse, a SIVA Dreg's Promise. This three round burst weapon causes SIVA charges to drop on precision kills which can be picked up to thrown at enemies for a decent amount of damage. Its catalyst will cause enemies who are hit by SIVA charges to fight for you and grants a 6% damage buff per enemy hit (max 30%)
* Iron Banner will have its first exotic quest in Destiny 2 and it is Young Wolf's Howl. Its will work exactly how it worked in D1, but will swing like Crown Splitter and heavy attacks cause enemies to take more damage from Solar Damage. The catalyst will cause light attacks to build up damage for a heavy attack. (24% per light attack for max of 120%)
* The Secret Exotic Sniper is called ***Plague*** which will be a 90 RPM Void Heavy Sniper. The exotic perk will increase damage per bullet after a headshot, missing a shot removes all stacks. The gun will have 7 rounds only however its catalyst grants another round that needs to be charged by 7 rapid headshots from itself. Landing all 7 shots makes the final round deal double the damage of the 7th round and deals a DoT damage equal to one shot over 5 seconds.

***Armor and Iron Banner:*** Iron Banner is in need of a rework in general so I wanted to share my idea... 

**Gameplay**: Mayhem Clash, Zone Control, Rift, Iron Forge and Iron Control. The first 3 modes are from D1 while the second 2 are something I made up. Iron game modes don't have Heavy or Supers, but Iron Lord Axes instead. Iron Forge is an Axe only mode while Iron Control has Axes spawn every 2 minutes and regains ammo from capturing Zones and getting kills with Axes are how you win. 

**Banner Armor**: Iron Banner has been using the same armor for years now and I think it is time for D1 sets to come in D2 instead of use getting repeat armor. Starting in Season of the Wolves, all guardians will be receiving the Iron Regalia Set. There will also be quest to earn a SIVA-less version of Iron Lord SIVA Exotics ornament.

**Season Pass Armor and Ornaments:** The season pass armor will be a SIVA'd version of D2 Warmind Armor with the ornaments making the SIVA coming from the armor match your subclass. 

***Summary of the Story****:* Lord Saladin is gonna to have an character that allows him to allow Rasputin to be an ally for the bigger threat, but it will not change his mind on SIVA. Saladin plans our siege on the Fallen Ketch which is how the Fallen were able to bring it to Cabal around the system. Lore vise, it makes sense that followers of Eramis would be after SIVA since she was after Outbreak Perfected in Season of the Drifter and the Cabal forming an alliance is not to strange since the entire current season is about such alliances. The titles were will be Young Wolf for the seasonal content and Iron Lord from Iron Banner.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

* SIVA Cabal and Fallen
* 3 Exotic Weapons: Young Wolf's Howl, Dreg's Curse and Plague
* New 'Old' Iron Banner gear
* New Combat Mod System using SIVA Nanites
* 3 Exotic Armor Chest Pieces that are SIVA Iron Lords
* Rasputin and Ana return
* Secret Mission on a SIVA Fallen Ketch
* SIVA Sectors
* SIVA Seasonal Armor",1615750306,2021-03-14 15:31:46

DestinyTheGame,Class Equity: How to Better Balance in Class Effectiveness for High-Level Crucible,"I’ve been seeing “class equity” thrown around the sub recently, and I really like it. After all, we don’t want class “equality” since then there wouldn’t be a real distinction between the classes and negate their entire purpose. “Equity” implies that each class should get the same attention and should offer a fun, powerful experience for players.

With this in mind, I wanted to express my own opinion as someone who has been playing Destiny since The Dark Below. I’ve seen lots of PvP metas come and go and am not too bad (I think a 1.2 or so K/D though I haven’t checked in a while) and have completed each raid in the game at least once. Here’s my take on the problems with classes in PvP.


Disclaimers first: I am a Titan main and I only play console, so my PvP opinions are made (specifically about dodge) with that in mind.

**bold**Why Are Hunters Dominant in the Crucible?**bold**

Three points. One: Hunters have been the dominant class in PvP, and especially competitive PvP, since at least D2’s start when they were all granted dodge as an intrinsic ability. Two: That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but… Three: The other two classes should receive some other factor to raise the playing field.

Now, Hunters, don’t downvote quite yet. I admit I am a huge Titan main and also that Behemoth is broken. I want to explain what I think the big issues are and see if anyone agrees since I haven’t seen this opinion on the sub, at least in the way I think of it.

Hunters are dominant. What does that mean? Recent data from guardian.gg actually shows that warlocks (specifically stormcallers and dawnblades, and we all know which trees they’re using) are just as high in use and win ratio as hunters. But, in aggregate, I think (someone correct me if I’m wrong) that Hunters still reign supreme.

Now, dominance is not necessarily a bad thing. No matter what Bungie does, some class or subclass will be determined to be the “best” by the sweats and that’s fine. But I don’t particularly like that it has been Hunters for so long. Yes, even during the OEM and Antaeus Wards metas. I guess for me, “meta” is what you see in Trials. For a long, long time, it was three Hunters or maybe two Hunters and one Warlock or Titan.

(I actually remember back in D1 when the sweats were all Warlocks with hand cannons, and that was what you saw in Trials, so the Hunter dominance has not been unbroken. But I digress.)

The aforementioned Warlock meta actually illustrates my point really well. Why were Warlocks the go-to class for D1’s high-end PvP? In my opinion, it was because their melee had a longer range. Back then, they also (I think) melee’ed at the same rate as the other classes.

In that way, Warlocks had a flat advantage to their neutral game. Additionally, not all Hunters could dodge: only a single subclass with what was considered to be a subpar super ability.

D2 launched and all Hunters had the ability to dodge no matter what. Additionally, dodge cooldowns are, by nature of mobility being a good PvP stat to begin with, very low across the board practically even though in practice another class could theoretically have a shorter cooldown.

Hunters are meta now, and have been throughout ALL of D2’s history, because of one ability. The dodge adds on to additional things that make Hunters’ movement the best in the game, such as their jump, which enables them to shoot while in motion. Top tree Dawns can also shoot while actively jumping, but no other class or subclass can. For example, as a Titan, I can jump, but I can’t shoot while maintaining my momentum.

These two things together – the Dodge and the (mostly) unique ability to shoot while preserving jump momentum – mean that Hunters are the best PvP class in terms of neutral game regardless of abilities.

I do not want to take this away. I strongly feel that the mobility described above gives a lot of identity to Hunters. Instead, I want to add things to the other two classes to help them compete.

**bold**Titans and Warlocks Are Also OP… Sometimes**bold**

Titans are sometimes perceived as OP because of a few factors. For one, I believe Titan subclasses are, Behemoth notwithstanding, not OP, but they often get OP exotics that make up for it. Original OEM is the go-to example, as were the Antaeus Wards. But when you take an OP exotic away, Titan subclasses don’t offer a lot to their neutral game, particularly since many of their abilities are melee-focused but that brings you into shotgun range.

Warlocks are a different story. They often start with excellent kits that are, as has been noticed by the community, absolutely demolished by the devs with repeated, often overhanded nerfs after repeated complaints.

**bold**Why is There a Long-Term Discrepancy?**bold**

So sure. Sometimes there are metas where Titans and Warlocks are more competitive. But that’s the exception rather than the rule.

Repeat: This is a problem mostly for console players, I think. The jump and dodge mean that Hunters cannot reasonably be tracked or competed against in close quarters.

Here’s the problem. The class identities Titans and Warlocks are, I think, at odds with an ideal PvP experience.

Titans are supposed to be tanky or aggressive strikers who take tons of damage and thrive in close-quarters combat. Problems:

•	All classes use shotguns, and Hunters use shotguns better than the other classes since, as mentioned, they can jump and shoot while preserving their momentum.
•	Furthermore, Hunters can totally break aim assist and (more importantly) maneuver around a player’s field of view faster than anyone can humanely react by double tapping crouch. Hunters are, therefore, the best shotgunning class in a duel. Titans can compete with their slide with raw aggressive pushes against non-shotgunning opponents
•	Titans cannot feasibly be granted more health in a practical sense since it would break the game. More bullets to kill a player when the player can shoot back with the same guns would be unfair and break Titans overall

Warlocks are supposed to be space mages with OP abilities and fast regeneration. Problems:

•	Make the magic too powerful, and you create an oppressive PvP environment where gunskill doesn’t matter. The community complains, they get nerfed
•	Boost their regen further and Warlocks would likely become turtles who hang around the back of the map all the time, slowing gameplay and lowering the “it” factor that often makes Destiny PvP so enjoyable

Hunters, I know I’m ragging on you hard here, but stick with me. Hunters thrive because their kit complements an ideal PvP environment. Hunters:

•	Can jump quickly and gain elevation in an instant in a way the other classes just can’t
•	Have kits that are often about boosting gunplay or aim assist or reload or some other neutral value
•	Have what amounts to a get out of jail free card on console. I know, I know, you can tell me so many times when someone fusioned you out of dodge or something. Doesn’t matter. In most practical cases, a dodge grants a Hunter another try at a gunfight OR the opportunity to escape

Here’s the bigger issue. This creates an explicit breach of class equity for high-level PvP. Hunters, so long as they have the best movement, will always be dominant and the other two classes will be unable to compete.

Why is Behemoth so popular with Titans? The super is OP sure, but more than that, the slide and melee punch give Titans comparable movement to Hunters for the first time in D2. There was a reason the best Titan players in D1 ran Twilight Garrison. Movement is king.

Further ruining things is Bungie’s apparent developer bias against Warlocks and for Hunters. There was no reason whatsoever for the Hunter shuriken to get buffed last pass, although it is fortunately being nerfed again. Right now, the environment benefits Hunters to such an extent that, once Behemoth is nerfed, I fully expect Crucible’s competitive PvP to be almost entirely comprised of Stasis Hunters and Top Tree Dawns. Stasis Titans will still be there because of the punch alone.

**bold**Solutions**bold**

So, what can Bungie do?

The way I see it, there are two options to increase class equity. Firstly, they could give each class a unique movement ability to be on par with the Hunter dodge. I don’t want this to happen for a few reasons.

•	It negates the Hunter identity and unique style of play
•	It makes each class feel even more similar than they already do

By that last point I refer to when Luke Smith said that playing different classes didn’t feel like much of a choice. I disagree as to the extent he claims, but I see his point. In PvP, each class can do what each other class can do when it comes to simple mechanics i.e. double jump, throw grenades, etc.

The second way Bungie could fix this problem (as I see it, anyway) is to make the other two classes feel more distinct in a way that doesn’t break the sandbox, in addition to stop nerfing Warlocks to the ground and buffing Hunters. Hunters do not need buffs AT ALL.

As I said earlier, something simple and slapdash like giving Titans more health or Warlocks more powerful grenades might not be the way to go. And I admit that I am not a developer or have experience designing game systems.

However, I do think that there are ways to improve things. Just off the top of my head…

•	Warlocks should be mages. Can they all get two grenade charges by default as an intrinsic ability, instead of OP grenades?
•	Warlocks should all be able to blink, perhaps? That’s different enough from dodge that I don’t think it distracts from Hunters’ roles and unique playstyles
•	Warlocks’ rifts need faster cast times. Right now casting one defensively if a Hunter is within dodge range is a death sentence
•	Titans should have a longer melee range by default, or do more melee damage by default. Right now Striker Titans and Arcstrider Hunters have extendable melee abilities, boosted melee damage, etc. But which one wins out in a shotgun contest? I’ll let you guess…

•	Titans could be resistant to slow or freeze, or take slow ticks less often to reflect their tankiness
•	Titans take less bodyshot damage by default, but not less headshot damage? Idk that might be OP

Bottom line: right now you can’t really improve the practical effectiveness in a neutral game context of Titans or Warlocks without OP abilities or exotics because the Hunters’ class fantasy/identity is superior in all cases. Bungie needs to come up with a way for Titans and Warlocks to shine as Titans and Warlocks, not as Behemoths, Dawnblades, etc. 

**bold**Quick Counterpoints**bold**

*italics*Hunters aren’t OP! I get killed all the time and I’m a Hunter!*italics*

I don’t care. Hunters are not “OP” per se, but the field is titled in their favor at all times except for brief windows where one other class gets an OP exotic or new subclass (Titans and Warlocks).
*italicsHow are Hunters so dominant if I kill them all the time?*italics*

Well, I don’t know. I think you’re blind if you want to tell me with a straight face that Trials and Comp are not consistently dominated by three-stacks of Arc, Solar, Void, or Stasis Hunters depending on the meta and which  new subclass came out.

I also think that it makes sense that the worst players, as well as the best players, are Hunters. Hunters as a whole class (not subclass) are the most populous in the game, so obviously you’ll have the best and worst players in Crucible with them. The Titans and Warlocks you see in Trials or Comp that perform well, in contrast, are likely good at the base game.

*italics*You’re just a salty Titan main.*italics*

I guess a little. But I really don’t want to neuter Hunters or make them unfun to play, and Dodge is super fun to use.

**bold**One Last Word…**bold**

I’ve already written too much but this stuff really irritates the hell out of me: stasis should not freeze past Banner Shield or inside Ward of Dawn. I cannot stress enough how much this does not make sense.

In WoD’s case, the bubble already has a big weakness compared to the Ice Tornado, the Well of Radiance, or any other lasting super. It goes away if the caster is killed. Kill a stasis hunter and the tornado keeps spinning around. It makes no sense that bubble goes away when Tornado, Nova Vortex, Thundercrash aftershocks, Well of Radiance, and plenty of other abilities (even grenades) keep burning or going after their caster is killed.

Furthermore, right now you can get frozen in the Ward of Dawn. This is a problem since, at the moment, you do not have armor of light when you are frozen. Instead, your health is replaced by the frozen health metric or bar or whatever the game uses, making it very easy to shatter and kill you with a single shotgun blast. It’s totally dumb, Bungie, that someone can throw a duskfield in the bubble, dodge near me with Bakris, and freeze me to totally negate my super and waltz in and shotgun me without a defense.

Banner Shield is even worse. Icebolts go through the shield, a Behemoth slams the ground near you and freezes you… It’s just absurd. Please consider this and make it impossible to be frozen in bubble period since being frozen essentially kills you anyway, and make it so the banner shield actually guards ice projectiles and fields.

**bold**Wrap Up**bold**

If you’ve made it to the end, thanks for reading. I’d love to be told it’s me, I’m wrong, that I need to get better at the game or something. But when I have seen three-stacks of Hunters instead of mixed teams of Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks for years on end, I have to believe it’s Hunters, not me, who are inherently unbalanced.

TLDR: Hunters are inherently the best because of dodge. The other two classes should get something else that makes them competitive instead of nerfing Hunters.",1615750238,2021-03-14 15:30:38

Blockers during the Primeval phase are just a mild annoyance and you can pretty much ignore them for the most part, unless a goblin is shielding the boss or knights are burning everything.

If the siphoning would keep going, maybe a bit slower to not be broken, you have to consider if is better to kill the blockers or just focus on the Primeval, like for example when a strong invader would start killing your team and not letting the Boss to be damaged. You can ignore them but you can risk to make the opponents to catch up faster.

This makes sidearms the only weapon class with no obtainable raid weapons in Destiny 2 after the vaulting of Spire (grenade launchers and smg's don't have any in-raid weapons available but Anarchy and Tarrabah can be bought from the kiosk). Not to mention that Last of the Legion was from SPIRE - a year one raid, and we haven't gotten a new raid sidearm in any of the five subsequent raids. And VoG returning won't fix this because it doesn't have a sidearm either!

DestinyTheGame,Weapon swap bug,"So I’ve been experiencing this since I want to say the start of this season, or since one of the early patches this season and I’m wondering why nobody else is talking about it. 


If you are using a kinetic in your primary slot and a special weapon in your energy slot (ex. Extraordinary rendition &amp; adored) when you try to switch to your heavy from your kinetic weapon (1st slot) you will quickly begin pulling out your energy weapon before actually swapping to heavy. This happens to me every time no matter what weapons I have on, as long as the previous conditions are met (kinetic primary, energy special).  This does not affect swapping from energy weapon straight to heavy. 


However, if I have a kinetic special and an energy primary (ex. Heritage &amp; Ikelos) I am able to switch from my heritage straight to my heavy weapon without seeing my Ikelos smg in between.  As long as these conditions are met, weapon swapping is normal.

DestinyTheGame,Gambit needs a Freelance Playlist,[removed],1615744322,2021-03-14 13:52:02
DestinyTheGame,Do you guys see how hard it is for Bungie to please you?,"Attunement of Control got nerfed recently. No it's not 'nerfed to the ground' like I've seen people say. No it's not ruined in PvE either, especially if you have high intellect with Geomags Stabilizers, which why wouldn't you.


An argument I've seen is that only a small portion of the community plays Trials so a nerf for such a small group and specific playlist is crazy. Is it though? Are you telling me that getting a super every round is balanced? Even in Comp and Quick Play the amount of Chaos Reaches you can get is insane. 'But Stasis is unbalanced' yeah and Bungie has already started nerfing it. They're slowly balancing Stasis as to not overnerf it but bring it in line. One half is happy while the other is mad.



Then there's the general Warlocks get nerfed quicker. Just remember that Shadebinder was nerfed before the holiday break at Bungie, so it felt like forever for Behemoth and Revenant to be nerfed. Also just to be clear: yes, I agree that in *CRUCIBLE*, Warlocks are indeed weaker. But, if you're even decent at Crucible, you can use stuff like top tree arc (Sidezz), bottom tree void (TrueVanguard) or even Well of Radiance for the memes in 6v6 (CammyCakes). Cause get what? If you're good, it doesn't really matter what subclass you play. 


Let me also make it clear: Warlocks are by far the best subclass for PvE. It doesn't even come close, with the only contenders are bottom tree sunbreaker with Phoenix Cradle or Hallowfire Heart, middle tree void with Ursa's or top tree void. An argument could be made for Cuirass of the Falling Star but in Master/GM nightfalls that would be sacrificing Ursa's which is more effective for the entire team. As for hunters, tether isn't even necessary anymore with other debuffs being more accessible, Divinity being the main one. Bottom tree void is pretty good for the invisibility and Revenant with Mask of Bakris with Anarchy and any arc weapon is also quite good. Celestial Nighthawk is something you simply switch to for DPS but besides that, not really that good.



I feel like I should also mention that Shadebinder is not bad *at all* and I don't get these 'OVERNERFED' comments like what? Did you even try it? It's still good in PvE with high ability up time and freezing potential and in PvP you still have a pretty good subclass. It's like one person says 'omg overnerfed' and everybody says the same thing.



Do you guys have any idea how hard it is to code this game to have stuff be different between gamemodes? Shit, they even mention in the TWAB that some changes had to be affected in PvE too. That's why disabling emotes and swords in Trials is taking so long. 


It's also funny how nobody mentions the other Light subclasses (PvP) for Titan and Hunter as if those aren't bad too. Blade Barrage, top tree Arcstrider,  both Tether, or top tree Hammers, bottom tree Sentinel etc.



Anyways, I just feel like the people in this sub are like some kind of hivemind but whatever.",1615743888,2021-03-14 13:44:48

Grounded type mods

I say ""type mods"" bc there are multiple modifiers that affect in-air damage taken

Pls... these modifiers are the worst part of any modifier heavy activity


I am okay with burns... I am okay with In-air based enemies (shanks, servidors, shirekers, etc) doing more damage

But taking away the vertical fun that Destiny has, Bc of a modifier is NOT FUN IMO

Maybe Change it to so that, *while U are in the air you DO LESS damage*... But not take more damage...

Dunno how Yall feel about this... but GMs and masters would be so much more enjoyable if grounded had another effect.",1615743583,2021-03-14 13:39:43

DestinyTheGame,If you don't prepare for Crucible it will feel unfair.,"I have seen a lot of posts and comments recently talking about how Crucible feels unfair and surprise!!! It is designed that way. Many players jump into Crucible thinking they will be on the same level as their opponent but put zero effort into building their characters, armor,, and weapons to pull off a win. You can't just jump into PVP with warmind cell mods  and PVE perk weapons after your strike and expect to have a good time or an advantage on your opponents who have grinded hours upon hours to get the proper PVP gear and weapons for Crucible.

So here are a couple things to consider before you get salty about Crucible gameplay and experience. And WARNING THIS IS A LONG POST. I am not an expert and typed this up on my phone so I apologize and don't have all the exact numbers but I feel confident in sharing this info. In no particular order...

1. Does your character have 100 recovery stat or close to 100 recovery? This can be achieved by equipping recovery stat mods on your armor for 4 points or by finding and equipping armor with high recovery already in it. I'd you don't you disadvantage yourself and your teammates in gun duels because your opponents can heal up much faster and re-engage you before your health is back. 

2. After 100 recovery do you have over 50 resilience? If you didn't know anything less than 50 resilience drops you into the range of being able to be killed by 2 shots from some weapons instead of 3. That means if you duel 1 on 1, normally, you have to land 3 shots on your opponent and they only have to land 2. Which means if you both have perfect accuracy he will always kill you before you have a chance to kill him if you both shoot at the same time. ( seems unfair to you in the match because you don't understand why you died so fast but to him it's because you were not properly set up. And FYI to us serious Crucible players we will check all the enemies stats and loadouts before the game starts, in the Roster tab to see who the easy prey will be. Looking at you 100 mobility 20 resilience hunter ha ha.) 

3. . What are the perks on the weapons you are using? Does your legendary weapon of choice have PVP perks such as; mutikill clip, killing wind, rampage, swashbuckler, opening shot, Quickdraw or do you have PVE perks like surrounded, Dragonfly, 4th times the charm.. etc ( basically some perks are better than others for PVP and it depends on the weapon you are using. Same goes for PVE).

4. Are you using the best subclasses,  jumps, aspects for stasis, and grenades etc for each character. While it may be fun to play bottom tree dawn blade on warlock you will get outclassed by someone playing the top tree dawnblade if you are strictly playing to win. ( This is assuming of course that each player is skilled enough to pilot both subclasses properly to maximum level. )

5. Map knowledge.  How well do you actually know the maps you are playing on? Do you know where the headshot angles are or common paths players will take? Do you know corners and angles where you will have an advantage on view over you opponent? Do you know every tunnel and where the heavy ammo spawns? How about where the overtime flag will spawn? All of this will be important in determining where you set up, where you push,  where you hold and protect. I can't stress enough understanding the maps. The best way to learn them is simply by doing a private match and exploring or just playing and learning from deaths and experience

6. Have you put into the time and effort to acquire PVP mods from Banshee and then equip them? Mods such as High-Energy Fire, Taking Charge, stacks on stacks, powerful friends, etc...  if you didn't know, having just high energy fire and taking charge makes it so you deal more damage until you get a kill after you pick up an orb of light.  

Also mods for the weapons you have equiped play a big role such as unflinching ""hand cannon"" mods,  ""hand cannon"" targeting mods, ""x"" loader or dexterity mods, ""shotgun/sniper ""scavenger mods ( equipping one of these makes it so you pick up extra special ""green"" ammo when you walk over it after a kill. So if I have it and you don't I now have 1 extra shotgun/sniper shot over you and I have the advantage. Which brings us to the next point.

7. Have you Masterworked you armor and weapons so that you can equipping these mods and increase your armor stats and get orbs of light? 

Armor first. If you don't put materials &amp; golfballs into upgrading your armor you won't be able to equip all those mods we just discussed.  Also masterworking your armor will give each piece +12 ( +2 for each category) on stats for your character meaning if you masterwork all 5 armor pieces you will get +10 to each stat category on your character.  So that 40 resilience becomes 50 just by masterworking your gear. 

Now weapons, if you masterwork a weapon it gains stats into 1 category boosting its overall performance. This is how two players can be shooting the same gun, same perks but one shoots farther than the other before damage fall off, or one can reload slightly faster than the other. This is due to the masterwork having a range buff or reload buff for instance. Also after you masterwork a gun it will create orbs of light on precision kills ( head shots) which if you remember gives you and your teammates, whoever picks up the orbs, a damage buff with the proper mods. So when you decide to try out a new gun you just got from gambit or wherever without masterworking it just know you put yourself at a disadvantage against a fully geared player.

8.. Lastly you need to understand your weapons time to kill and kill range. Each weapon has an optimal time you can kill someone.  This is based on you correctly landing each gun shot as quickly as possible with 100 percent accuracy. For example 1 head shot and 2 body shots or 2 head shots and 1 body. Some guns are faster at killing than others. 120 hand cannons typically require 3 shots to kill and have a time to kill value of about 1 second, (for the veterans this number is obviously an average but it works for the discussion.) 140 hand cannons are slightly faster at like .9 secs but require you to be closer and sometimes land more shits if you miss the headshot.  Pulse rifles and submachine guns can be even faster but require you to land multiple bullets. I am not well versed in each weapons time to kill number, you can Google those later if you are curious,  but the point is that if we both have perfect accuracy shooting at each other exactly at the same time. One gun will have an advantage over the other in certain instances. What this means is that you need to learn your guns kill time and look at what your opponents are using to understand theirs. 

 Also range affects these kill times as well. Pulse rifels and scout rifles can shoot farther than common 120 and 140 hand cannons. So if you pick a fight against a scout rifle down a long corridor with a 140 hand cannon they will most definately beat you before you can get in range to hurt them. 

*** Also a last disclaimer, even if you get the proper weapons and guns you still will get beat by good players.  This is where the fun of Crucible is. Finding ways to outplay and outsmart your opponent after getting all the proper gear is what makes me come back every day. It's a thrill seeking challenge that I look forward to. And I only have a 1.22KDA so nothing to be boasting about***

Alright this has been a long post but I hope you understand just how much is going on inside of Crucible.  Next time you feel like it was an unfair match maybe take a look at your gear and see what you could improve to bring yourself up to your opponents level. I am by no means an expert on this subject unlike many of the great streamers and youtubers I have watched but I feel like the info is pretty valid. Hope it helps. See you in the Crucible Guardians.",1615742873,2021-03-14 13:27:53

DestinyTheGame,Perk Configuration Concept: Better RNG," 

By [u/JarekoLT](https://www.reddit.com/u/JarekoLT/) and [u/trustniico](https://www.reddit.com/u/trustniico/)

**The Hook**

Imagine a system where Guardians unlock and collect perks for weapons as they find them through random rolls. Once these perks are collected, resources can be expended (at Banshee) to customize the perk configuration on the weapon they found them on. This weapon can then be purchased and reconfigured at will. This does two things:

1. Reworks Banshee as an actual gunsmithing vendor. What is Banshee best at? Working on that Auto Rifle for 4 years. Now imagine if that Auto Rifle was your unique gun. Neat huh? Want a different scope/barrel/or damage perk on that gun you love? Well based on what you’ve discovered, Banshee has you covered.
2. Shifts the focus of Destiny’s reward system from a grindy rage against the lottery machine to a less grindy, but more customizable system. This new system offers more ways to play and enjoy your favorite guns, while preserving the progress you’ve made with them (sunset or not).

Do I have your attention? Good.

**Gunsmithing with Banshee**

In this new gunsmithing role, Banshee becomes the center of collecting weapons and perks in Destiny. No longer will players have overflowing vaults full of multiple guns with different rolls. Banshee keeps track of all these elements for you. When a gun is first unlocked/collected, it appears in the Gunsmith and those perks are considered the default configuration of that weapon. Receiving another copy of the same weapon unlocks that copy’s perks in the perk configuration process at the Gunsmith. Here is a rough flow:

1. Players interact with Banshee and enter the Gunsmith hub. There are three sub-categories at the Gunsmith: Raid Weapons, Legendary Weapons, and Sunset Weapons.

[Gunsmith New Title Screen](https://imgur.com/h7akeze)

2. Selecting a sub-category of weapons brings the player to a collection of weapons filled with the guns they have collected/unlocked during gameplay. Here players can hover over a choice weapon and do one of two things:

a. Purchase the existing configuration of that weapon for enhancement cores and glimmer (and maybe gunsmith components).

b. Edit the existing configuration of that weapon.

[Gunsmith Legendary Weapons Category](https://imgur.com/IfvEHFg)

3. ***If Edit Configuration*** is selected, players are brought to the selected weapon’s edit screen. Here players can select various perks (for a small cost) and swap them for other perks they have collected from obtaining other copies of that weapon. Once a perk is purchased, that perk becomes part of the default perk configuration of that weapon in the Gunsmith. Greyed out perks indicate that perk has yet to be obtained from a random roll.

[Perk Configuration Edit Example 1](https://imgur.com/0QjKiBX)

**NOTE:** Keen readers can see that, in this proposed system, PvE and PvP kills are now both tracked inherently by the gunsmith. These kills can be seen on all rolls of a weapon once it has unlocked kill tracking at least once through masterworking.

[Perk Configuration Edit Example 2](https://imgur.com/42ZDZjc)

**NOTE:** Barrel and magazine/round perks can also be swapped out!

4. Players also have the option to swap out the existing masterwork mod with any other previously discovered masterworks (found on other random rolls). Progress on masterworking each mod is tracked. If a player decides to change things up and exchange their current masterwork for another, their progress on the first mod is preserved. Once an alternate masterwork is purchased, that mod becomes part of the default perk configuration of that weapon in the Gunsmith.

[Perk Configuration Masterwork Edit Example](https://imgur.com/6qAG5yN)

**Sunsetting**

In this system, when Bungie sunsets weapons, they are removed from the Legendary Weapons category and added to the Sunset Weapons category.

In the Sunset Weapons category, weapon perk configuration, kill tracking, and masterwork progression works the same way. When Bungie decides to re-issue weapons, the gunsmith preserves discovered perks, masterwork progress, and kill tracking. This way, players that have invested the time in completing a weapon before it was sunset only have to farm the weapon for its new perks (if added) instead of “re-completing” it.

This system also allows players to continue farming for perks they may have missed when a weapon was in the loot pool. Each undiscovered perk can be purchased after completing a specific PvE or PvP kill requirement. This system would help alleviate FOMO as all players would have access to the best roll of a weapon even after it has been sunset.

[Perk Configuration Sunset Weapon Example](https://imgur.com/Rjl1v4X)

**Shifting Systems**

Grinding for that perfect roll is the core of Destiny’s gameplay. Players always desire the perfect tool for any given situation. This new perk customization system would allow players to collect the best perks for any given weapon while also allowing for customization and experimentation with ease. In this system, no perk should feel as though it is settled upon, but instead chosen for the proper situation or encounter. This provides a more meaningful representation of choice as a player collects and unlocks loot in Destiny. 

A system focused on completing weapons would make every weapon feel like a pinnacle quest when completing its perk tree. It would give every gun an “end-in-sight” for grinding.

**Closing Thoughts**

Destiny can either be desired to be played because it demands a lot from a player, or it can be desired to be played because it has a lot of alluring ways to play. The current system leans more into the former; Almost to the point where players could have an unhealthy connection to the game due to the attention it demands. A system like the one proposed above could provide a better balance between completionism and RNG, as well as respects the player’s past progression as weapons are re-issued.",1615741953,2021-03-14 13:12:33

DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, you’ve said that “how it feels” feedback is helpful. Well, in Gambit, I feel powerless.","Far too often in Gambit my guardian feels powerless both in the sense I am weak and ineffectual against enemies and invaders, and also in the sense that it feels like I have very little agency to be able to affect the game. 

**Examples**

I feel powerless against an invader with wallhacks, overshield and a seemingly infinite supply of one-shot heavy ammo.

I feel powerless when I can barely damage the adds in the latter waves because I can’t get any special or heavy drops and my primary barely damages the yellow bars.

I feel powerless to impact the outcome of the match when there are several blockers on the bank and my team won’t help me kill them or when my teammate is running around trying to get 15 motes when we are 3 away from primeval.

I feel powerless to fight the enemies when they are teleporting around me. 

I feel powerless when I do kill a bunch of enemies and half the motes fall under the map. 

I feel powerless when I’m against a 4-stack that can melt the Primeval as soon as it spawns with 4x Thundercrash or Chaos Reach.

I feel powerless when I get snowballed by the *blocker - invade - wipe* loop that is far too common. 

**Suggested Solutions**

It’s clear the gamemode needs an overhaul, and I don’t really have any specific solutions, but I do feel these three areas are most in need of being reworked:

1.	Ammo economy, particularly the availability of heavy ammo. I won’t list invasion as a separate point because I feel like a lot of the issues with invasion stem from heavy availability
2.	The ‘flow’  of matches that leads to snowballing and being piled with blockers and invasions
3.	The ability to instantly melt the primeval if your team is co-ordinated 

In addition to that, teleporting enemies, motes glitching under the map and mote pickup need to be sorted out. 

I do feel the mode has the potential to be fun and unique but it just doesn’t feel good or fun to play just now.  I’ve played it a lot - I got Reckoner and Dredgen and am close to gilded Dredgen - and the current state of it is definitely the worst it’s been.",1615741890,2021-03-14 13:11:30

DestinyTheGame,What is the best way to get glimmer? Is there a way to farm it?,I wanna buy a weapon from the lost monument thingy and I have everything except the glimmer.. what's the fastest way I can get some glimmer?,1615741481,2021-03-14 13:04:41
DestinyTheGame,"Upcoming changes to stasis/ freeze abilities, questions and concerns...","First off,  read the post.

So, I'm curious as to why titans and warlocks get to retain an instant freeze melee ability, while the hunters are not only losing the ability to freeze, but also aim assist and damage?

I get that the hunter melee has too much tracking as it is now, and changing that is perfectly fine, the damage reduction is also fine as 90 damage is a bit much. However the issue is that most hunters don't run around with both melee charges up, and now that using both melee charges will no longer result In a freeze, that becomes an issue..

I don't want to hear about how it still slows people, that's bs, the slowed person can still fight back, where as the frozen opponent cannot.

All 3 classes have access to each grenade, so that's irrelevant in this conversation. 

The issue is balance, warlocks get an instant freeze tracking melee, titans will retain their cheap melee.. hunters seem to be getting screwed pretty hard in terms of the melee ability. 

This has nothing to do with salt, or anything outside of balance, it just seems to go against balancing when 2 classes still retain an ability to INSTANTLY freeze vs throwing 2 shurikens and still not freezing. 

Another example of bungie not knowing how to properly balance something and nerfing it into the ground. 


And onto topic 2, the class ability, TWO slides for titans with a cool down, TWO icarus dashes for warlocks with a cool down... ONE dive for hunters with a cool down. 

I get that hunters can shatter crystals with it, but so can titans with the slide,  and mainly both are used as a movement technique.. so why not 2 shatters for hunters? Keep everything even???",1615741470,2021-03-14 13:04:30

Is it  supposed to be this unbalanced?

I must have played around 20 matches of which only a handful were actually close. Over 75% of the games are a complete landslide in which the losing team doesn't even spawn the final boss...

Is this what Bungie calls balance or am I just really unlucky with the team composition?",1615735188,2021-03-14 11:19:48
DestinyTheGame,I'd be less miffed about the Chaos Reach nerf if so many Warlock subclasses weren't nerfed into the ground already,"I get that it's wonky that Chaos Reach seems to ignore walls sometimes if you're near a corner, or something. That is indeed BS.

I get that if they changed it (unintentionally?) so that even dying while currently doing your Lightning Kamehameha refunds you Super energy, that is also BS. Dying while using it should mean you have zero super energy when you respawn again, since it's not like it's hard to cancel early anyway. If you catch a Warlock mid-Super, they should get punished.

But a flat nerf to Super energy refunded when you successfully cancel hurts when *holy fuck why do I think I've defaulted to Chaos Reach so much in the first place?*

Voidwalker: Who even think this is good anymore? Top tree, the grenades take forever to charge up for benefits that are less threatening than Duskfield is naturally--and I don't honestly expect that to change even after the nerfs. An overcharged Vortex grenade only kills Guardians if they just don't react to it. An overcharged Axion does good damage but is easily dodged. Scatter can't ever be relied upon, period.

Slowva Bomb, well, is slow enough that some Supers just kill you first or can dodge it before it even hits the ground.

Bottom tree is very risk/reward, if you're godly you can go on killstreaks with Devour, but you lose all value if you eat a grenade and just die instantly to a special weapon or Super or whatever. I can't remember the last time a Warlock killed me and instantly healed because they had Devour going, it's just not used except by some streamers.

Middle tree? A complete disgrace. It's bad, and it's even more awful that it's been allowed to be that way for so long. Nova Warp takes so long to charge up its attacks for a Super that has to get into shotgun range to that it's comical, and HHSN is kind of a joke now.

Dawnblade: Top tree remains great. Got that going, at least...

Middle tree, just no. If you want be meme-y and play Healer by equipping Lumina and throwing healing grenades at your friends, go ahead, but it's a meme. Nobody uses Well of Radiance tree in Crucible for serious business.

Bottom tree Dawnblade is like middle tree Voidwalker, it's disgusting how awful it is. It's great in PvE *but only with Dawn Chorus* which is another travesty; nerfing something into the ground and then un-nerfing it with an Exotic is a band-aid on a deep wound. Now the subclass is locked into an Exotic choice.

But in Crucible it remains terrible, you have *nothing* useful until your Super is online, and even then, it's not even the best Super around anyway. It's frankly the most boring subclass in the game, the **one** unique action you can perform in your neutral game is to...awkwardly dive towards the ground to heal a bit. Fun?

Stormcaller: Top tree has been pretty dead in Crucible as well. Your Stormtrance gets laughed at by Silence and Squall, Glacial Quake, and Shadebinder. Your Arc Web-boosted grenades are again, less threatening than Stasis abilities. There's precious little reason to pick this. 

Bottom tree: See top tree, but it's even worse since it can't Ionic Blink, has even worse grenades and melees, and Arc Souls are laughable.

Mid tree: Like top tree Dawnblade, well at least we have this going for us. Being able to spam a Super as simple as Chaos Reach makes up for a lot. Grenades are default, melee is a bit meh, but at least you can use them a bit more often and have more Supers than other Warlock subclasses. One that can shut down ground-based Supers pretty well or just give a ""fuck you in particular"" to 1-2 enemies in sight and then shut it off to preserve some energy.

**Conclusion**: For a long, *long* time I've seen exactly two Warlock subclasses in the Crucible--Attunement of Sky and Attunement of Control--because the rest are outclassed or remain nerfed into sorry states, and now one of those is getting a nerf as well because Warlocks can't have nice things, I guess.

Like I said, if I felt like Warlock *had* several other options, I'd be less miffed about the Chaos Reach nerf. Which I suspect is mostly because of a certain Elimination playlist which has become so passive and campy that some fireteams do nothing but watch their cooldowns, thus making anything that Supers more often feel too powerful as a result.

If Chaos Reach must get punished because of one playlist with 1% of the player population actually participating in it, can other subclass trees get some actual love? Maybe there's so much Chaos Reach in all playlists because Warlocks feel *bottlenecked into it* due to lack of viable choices.

Top tree Dawn, Chaos Reach, everything else basically sucks.",1615735068,2021-03-14 11:17:48

By allowing us to earn previous seasons ornaments(I'm looking at you season of the hunt warlock set) we won't have fomo.

I was thinking we could make a system where the new weekly bounty system extends to previous seasons. so if I do a weekly challenge from the season of the hunt I level up on the season of the hunt&amp;chosen passes . while if I do a season of chosen challenge I rank up for only season of the chosen.

We already have the weekly challenges system built in to our ui just extend this for previous seasons as well please.

This will help people who bought the season pass who ended up feeling burnt out. This also benefits the players who just don't have enough time to play the game. This new system will help all players and help reduce fomo and burnout. As now I can do challenges over a longer amount of time knowing I can do them later on.

DestinyTheGame,Something I'd love to see make an appearance in Destiny,"An expansion centred around actually being a Guardian. It could be set in a large, interconnected planet, with different landscapes, like a city in ruins as a middle zone, with multiple exits into the different zones, hollowed out buildings etc. Inside one or two zones is a populated Human settlement, this brings a new type of patrol and Public Event; 'Escort' and 'Defence'.

In the lore, Guardians escort civilians to the Last City, right? Well, 'Escort' would be about escorting Human survivors to another zones Landing Zone, to be taken to the Last City. During your escort, you are ambushed by Fallen, Hive or Cabal, with each ambush party being spearheaded by a yellow bar. Kill all the yellow bars before you reach the landing zone and you begin the Heroic patrol, which sees the transport ship being shot out the sky, and it turns into a king of the hill type situation where you hold a zone for a set number of minutes. Holding the zone will result in a mission clear and some unique cosmetic rewards, like a new shader (Purple Feather), which looks like Saint-14 feathers.

Then we have 'Defence', when the public event starts, our Ghost could say something along the lines of;

""Guardian, a nearby settlement has sent out a distress call. Let's check it out, shall we?""

Essentially, you take your sparrow to the settlement and see it being overwhelmed by enemies. You clear it out, then hold the line, with enemies spawning in waves at four different sides (Think of the Exo challenge where you're holding the point against waves of Vex, but with all four sides). To activate the Heroic version, you have to destroy the enemys transport ship. Completing it could reward a unique emblem ""Saviour"".

The settlement idea could even bring new items. Think of it like a Wild West settlement, where you enter the tavern and purchase drinks/items that give you heavy ammo (Like D1s Heavy Ammo Synths), or even some silly, gimmicky cosmetics like a fedora or something cliché-y cowboy/gunslinger centred. The more patrols and Public Events you do in that zone/planet, the more reputation you gain. The higher the reputation, the lower the price for items, and maybe even an Exotic quest for a western-inspires armour/weapon.

I just want to experience what a Guardian is meant to be doing, helping civilians survive and taking them to the City. We only ever read about Guardians doing that, or reading about settlements like Palamon. I'd like to experience it.",1615731569,2021-03-14 10:19:29

DestinyTheGame,We desperately need more Legendary special weapons in the Kinetic slot,"I'd been dragging my ass on continuing to do the Deep Stone Crypt raid, finally did it again last night and got Heritage, which is great.

So what this means if I want to use an Exotic energy primary like Riskrunner, or Sunshot, or Ticuu's Divination, or Trinity Ghoul, etc my choices are now:

* Heritage
* Long Shadow
* shitty Toil and Trouble

Hell, the main reason I needed to do DSC was to get Heritage because until then, Exotic energy primaries felt almost unusable because I didn't have a good special weapon to pair them with.

Sure, there are a few others, like Astral Horizon (probably inaccessible to many players simply because they don't want to play that mode). And there's Exotics like Witherhoard, Bastion, and Arbalest but those are unavailable if your energy weapon or heavy is Exotic.

Point being we desperately need more options for Legendary kinetic special weapons. More sniper rifles but especially more shotguns and grenade launchers would be amazing. (Too bad we'll probably never get fusion rifles in that slot that aren't Exotic.)

It's probably moot to say this, but I still will be REALLY disappointed if we get more loot and there's not several kinetic special weapons that are legendary. I just hope that's already in the works.",1615726681,2021-03-14 08:58:01

DestinyTheGame,Exotic Warhammer concepts,"A lot of people want Warmhammers as weapons so i made a few concepts on perks for exotic Warhammers :)

First off,how would Warhammers be? Warhammers would be the same as swords but also the opposite. They would be melee weapons that have a slower ""rate of fire"" but will do significantly more damage in exchange due to their size. 


(Concept 1)
Name: Skullcrusher.

Skullcrusher is an exotic Hive-looking warhammer artifact with the exotic perk ""Death to All"".

Death to All: Doing 5 light attacks will charge up it's perk. Doing a heavy attack will activate it's perk,causing a strong shockwave around you which will kill smaller enemies and damage bigger ones. It's great for crowd control as well as for additional boss damage.



(Concept 2)
Name: Mjolnir

Donar is an exotic Warhammer with the exotic perk ""Thunder's Fury"".

Thunder's Fury: Heavy attacks will shoot a lightning rather than do a ground slam. 

This inspiration comes mainly from my love of Tomb Raider games with ""Tomb Raider: Underworld"" being the main inspiration since in this game,you go around the world to find Thor's gauntlets and hammer and get to use the Hammer against enemies. I also got this inspiration when i was doing Pit of Heresy and noticed that the Hive artifact reminds me a lot of Excalibur from Tomb Raider:Legend where both are ""rusty""/old artifacts that are able to send a green shockwave attack.


More ideas for Exotic hammers but i don't have any names:

-A Stasis Warhammer that is like the Titan stasis super slam attack. Press and hold a certain button to activate the perk but this will make you spend more ammo when doing a heavy attack.

-A void Warhammer which will spawn a ""black hole"" upon a heavy attack that ""sucks in"" nearby enemies into the hole(similar to a Duskfield grenade but it won't slow you down). This attack is useful for crowd control when you wanna get multiple ads in a small area and finish them all off with a Warhammer attack.

-A solar Warhammer that will do a spin attack,causing an area of effect fire cirle around you.",1615726141,2021-03-14 08:49:01

DestinyTheGame,Ideas for buffing some under performing exotics,"    Sleeper Simulant: all linear fusions need a damage buff, sleeper most of all. But as the ultimate warmind weapon, sleeper needs something extra. New perks: kills with this weapon generate warmind cells, multiple precision hits generate warmind cells, and holding reload generates a pulse which detonates all warmind cells in its radius. The idea here is to improve total damage and add clear potential while feeding into its identity as a warmind weapon.
    Acrius and darci: these should be made into special weapons. Acrius will never be able to composted with swords and darci will never be able to compete with Whisper. Putting them in the special category could allow them to find a place in the game where they would otherwise continue to sit unused.
    Merciless: this should become a pvp focused exotic. Change the perk to increases chafe rate on a kill, until you next reload (including things like hunters dodge and transversive steps). This would allow it to become a fun exotic in the crucible. You would first have to gather enough social to load its magi zone to full, and then get 2+ kills to start it ramping up, but once you did it would shred the next 4 to 5 targets you come across. Obviously this would render it useless for dps, but nobody really uses it for that right now anyways. But we could use a fusion rifle that rewards good gameplay
    Two tailed fox: catalyst which grants the perk kitsune: adds a third arc rocket with the special effect that enemies killed by it generate a massive arc explosion. Think warmind cell detonation size and damage. 
     Prospector: change the perk to this: shots fired from this weapon stick to their target dealing no damage, hold reload to detonate all stuck projectiles. Damage is increased per stuck projectile.  So you stick a bunch of bombs to your target then detonate them for huge damage.",1615724765,2021-03-14 08:26:05

DestinyTheGame,"As a former Destiny player from the outside looking in, here's what I think should change","I recently saw all this stuff about being able to do a 12 man raid, and how the community went wild for it. I think there should be a huge change to the way raids work.

For all of destiny, it has been 6 guys, kill bad guys, kill 3-4 big bad guys, win. 

I think for the next raid they should do something way different, like a 9 man raid, or perhaps a simulation raid, where zavala builds a simulation machine to train the guardians for what is to come in the final DLCs.

 I think it capitalises on people loving more than 6 people in the raid, and it puts a different twist on how raids work while also building hype for the final DLCs.",1615717732,2021-03-14 06:28:52

DestinyTheGame,Add Quickdraw to the Astral Horizon’s perk pool,"Now that the ‘older’ Astral Horizon will no longer be sunset, the new one is simply inferior. I completely understand moving away from Quickdraw as a perk on aggressive shotguns, but my issue lies with inability to *get* arguably the most important perk on what may be the best shotgun in the game (likely after Felwinter’s gets tuned). 

Surplus is an okay perk, but as a replacement for Quickdraw, it just doesn’t measure up. I’d suggest simply replacing Surplus with Quickdraw for Astral. 

And again, I’m not trying to advocate for Quickdraw on aggressive frame shotguns. Rather, I think that if we’re going to have such an incredibly compelling weapon/perk combination available for use in end-game PvP activities, everyone should have the opportunity to get one.",1615716857,2021-03-14 06:14:17

DestinyTheGame,"The lost bird ""Where. Is. Crow."" //My own Lore// please read//","   In the wake of the land tank on Nessus plunged by masses of Guardians, an idle Osiris is look at the sky from the Bazaar amd wonders in his head, what if Crow is right and Caital is merely just pressured by tradition and the honor the Cabal have. Ikora asks him from her spot ""Osiris, what was it like, lossing your light and"" she paused then finished ""Sagira"" 

     Osiris reached into his pocket and took out a broken, and lightless Sagira. 

     ""Like a sudden death wish, one that takes time to pass into fruition. I had forgotten the fear of death, but now I am reacquainted with my old enemy, one that the traveler can not redo all due to Xivu Arath and her High Celebrant"" he sets the broken, and lightless Sagira down on a table and walks to Ikora. 

     ""You done this city well, so has Zavala, the late Cayde-6, and so has the Guardian. A new ally I am sure you have heard of, Crow. Has helped us with dealing with Caital amd her army of Cabal, I even assigned him as Zavala's personal bodyguard, as though well I not fit anymore for such tasks, the death of me by a Legionary or even a Psion would mean the death of Zavala as well"" he pauses 

      Ikora reaches out and pulls her ghost out 
""Osiris, we will find a way to give you your light back"" 
   Osiris sighs ""It's not the light that I want back, although as understandable it would be to want it back. The bond between me amd Sagira, was much stronger then the light and I, when Sagira was destoryed, I felt a pain much worse then lossing the light, I in such a long time had felt the pain of death of a loved one"" Osiris looks away to cover his tear ""It's not the same without Sagira"" 

     Ikora reaches her hand out to hold Osiris's hand to reassure him that those who care for him still exist, Osiris spoke again 
   
     ""Thank you"" he then asks Ikora another question ""The skull above lord Shaxx, that is an Ahamkara is it not"" Ikora nods yes ""Savathûn is likely watching from the skull, the drifter mentioned Shaxx sang a tune that Eris heard on the moon"" Ikora steps back 

      ""What is it"" Osiris asked 
      Osiris then feels his heart race and has a heart attack, he falls and curls, Ikora yells for a medic but no one is there, the sky turns blood red and Savathûn appears over the Traveler and with a flick it breakes the traveler into pieces 

     ""You! Are merely a puppet of the light Miss Ikora Ray. I am a GOD, I am the destruction of Sol"" Savathûn reaches his arm out and with a swipe destorys the whole last city, bodies fling everywhere dismembered, yelling out too Ikora to help them, but Ikora couldn't do anything she was restrained by a force 

     ""Hello light creature"" Xivu Arath says as the God of War morphs into a familar face ""Do you wish to die as well wielder of light"" Ikora screams and then she see's the face, it is Uldren Sov and he is carrying a body on his back ""Do you remember me Ikora, the poor lightless guardian that lost his sister cause of your guardians messing with things they shouldn't mess with, thanks to your kind my sister is dead, I am dea-"" Uldren stops speaking and Xivu Arath morphs into Crow 

     ""If only Cayde 6 were here"" Crow says, and Ikora breaka free and punches Crow, the vision ends to realize she punched Osiris 

      ""You were silent there for a good while there Ikora what happend"" Osiris held his cheek with his palm, and Ikora was showing a face of immense anger ""Ikroa what vision did you have"" she looked him dead in the eyes 


      ""Where. Is. Crow."" She said and Osiris went silent.
     
      ""Where. Is. CROW"" she yelled and pushed Osiris against the floor, Drifter heard the commotion as he walking into the Bazaar and ran to Ikora and Osiris 
  
       ""What are you doin' sista, this is a public place"" he then saw her face ""Oh oh, this ain't good"" and he seperates Ikora from Osiris ""Calm down the both of you"" 

     ""Where. Is. Crow."" Ikora looked to Drifter instead ""I have got no clue lady"" she looked at Osiris ""Where. Is. Crow."" Ikora pulled out a hand cannon and pointed it at Osiris ""Ikora please"" Osiris was scared ""Crow is in the H.E.L.M"" he quickly said ""I would like to see Crow"" Ikora said and Osiris nodded ""I would like to speak to"" she grew anger ""Uldren Sov"" Osiris's face grew pale as snow and lightheaded, and showed Ikora the way. 

      Drifter watched Osiris walk Ikora from the Bazaar to the H.E.L.M. and walked to Osiris's spot, and saw Sagira and hold her shell, Eris might know how to perform a Séance on you little buddy"" he transmats out.",1615714494,2021-03-14 05:34:54

DestinyTheGame,"How the Omnioculus is The Best Exotic to Use For All Endgame Team Content Including Grandmasters, and Why You Should Love Bottom Tree Void | Hunter Build","If you haven't gotten the omnioculus as of yet for the hunter, then you are missing out big time in terms of what it can offer for both top, middle or bottom tree void. Currently With the omnioculus, if you combine it with Rat King and reload per kill with it you can gain a good chunk of charged melee energy back and thus have unlimited invisibility at your disposal but also get around a 50% damage reduction while invisible. This can be viable for a number of content where you and your team would like to survive very hectic situations or better off, mess around with a team of three to six who have the same loadout as you.

That's actually quite a scary thought the more I think about it.

Unfortunately, Bungies recent TWAB has mentioned that the Rat king and Omnioculus combo will be patched and thus put a end to a completely nutty build.

However, that doesn't mean the exotic as a whole becomes useless and I've found that the best way to make this up is to simply have Way of the Pathfinder and Elemental Well mods for a very nice team focused setup.

**Subclass**: Way of the Pathfinder

**Exotic**: Omnioculus

**Primary**: Rat King (Until it goes)

**Secondary**: Orewing Maul or Any Void With Wellspring or Demolitionist

**Heavy**: Any

**Mods**

**Head** \- Ashes to Assets and Font of Wisdom mod.

**Arm** \- Bolstering Detonation x2 and High Energy Fire mod

**Chest** \- Concussive Dampener x2 and Elemental Ordnance mod

**Leg** \- Absolution, Invigoration and Radiant Light mod

**Cloak**\- Distribution, Bomber and Blast Radius mod

**What Does it All do?**

With the rat king included with the setup you can be become a team supporter by providing your team with unlimited invisibility, unlimited heart of the pack buff and can provide Elemental Wells for boosting there abilities further and if they have EW mods as well then they can greatly benefit from it.

Without the rat king it will still be the same but, you have more room of flexibility and you can still achieve the same level of melee regen even with out the exotic in mind, and all you need to do is heavily crutch on your grenades.

You see, from the subclass tree your offered two perks tat will strongly improve the build by a lot. Lockdown will increase your grenade duration for longer while combat provision will provide grenade energy from making allies invisible and melee energy from damaging them. All you really need to do is have a high Discipline stat say 60 to 70 and then have a weapon with the Demolitionist perk and just spam your grenades till the end of time and thus can have unlimited invisibility as well.

To play it safe for high end content having a high strength stat wouldn't hurt either as your getting a faster cooldown from them as well. If you have the radiant light mod then do by all means add it in and go from there but if not, have a wellspring weapon on hand or better off, don't. Either way the build will do you well for Dungeons solo or Nightfall's especially if you have a team who know what there doing but are also using team based abilities to keep everyone stacked.

This is why having elemental well mods are very powerful when you focus heavily in them. Of course, warmind cells and Charged With Light are still favourable but the synergy alone from the mods are interesting.

For more indepth look into the build, do check out the video below:

DestinyTheGame,Sunday Plz - Add Strike Specific Loot to Playlist Strikes,"Greetings Guardians!

Ever since the conception of this sub, we've dealt with floods of reposts. We’re sure you’re familiar with them. Many are for important issues that are shared by the entire player base, while others are just for personal requests and desires for the game. The [Bungie Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) was shortly implemented after conception as a central ""wish-list"" for all that we, the community, desired. It is *completely* user driven. With rare exceptions, nearly all submissions are sent in by you, the users of this subreddit!

However, just like Destiny 2, our wiki article began to experience problems as it grew over time. It's been getting just a few sizes too big. We understand that the continued addition of topics has begun to encroach on your ability to continue the conversation towards matters that mean the most to you, and even though [the Bungie Plz has seen so many successes over the years, **with well over 100 officially implemented game suggestions and desires**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz#wiki_completed_in_destiny_2.21), there's still dozens upon dozens of retired topics that haven't seen the light of day for many months...even years!

---

Every Sunday, this thread will focus on a certain retired Bungie Plz topic **of your choosing, voted by the users.** We will curate a list of 5 suggestions to help focus your voting process, **but you get the final say** on what is talked about each week. By all means, if one topic is overwhelmingly desired despite not being part of those 5 items we picked, then we'll be happy to go with that one. Our curated list is only to help you focus the conversation. The only stipulation is that the topic must be new every week. This thread is for the entirety of the Bungie Plz wiki, so no back-to-back voting!

Think of these threads as a way to keep the spark alive, and to bring old topics up to fresh light. For example, do we still want to move Queenbreaker to the special slot? Or does Arbalest serve that purpose well enough now? Do we still want an all-black shader, or do we want a character barbershop more?

You tell us! This is your conversation, guardians.

For this week, you voted on:

#Add The Nightfall Strike Specific Loot to Playlist Strikes

For next week, here are some suggestions:

* Increase Vault Size
* Make Warlock bonds more cosmetically distinct and appealing
* Add a Crucible mode without Heavy and/or Supers
* Display Light Level/Power Level instead of season pass rank
* Veteran Dialogue option for PC players (and console)

Sound off in the sticky comment for which one sounds good (just give us a moment to put it up), or [anything else in the Bungie Plz wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) that catches your eye, and we'll do our best to accommodate!

DestinyTheGame,Real money transactions should offer more,"I jumped into D2, 2 weeks ago or so. I love it so far, casual player slowly climbing the ladders :-)

What I noticed is that the real money transactions relate to skins for gear/ ships/ emotes. This structure will not have people spend significantly. It does not invite for regular money drops, while long term this should be something Bungie is looking for.

I just bought the season pass and felt no reason whatsoever to purchase anything else. I’m totally fine with this, but cashflow wise this is not a great setup for a cash shop.

DestinyTheGame,Eyes of tomorrow really needs to be looked at in gambit.,"After working on my dredgen 2 title, I gotta say that eyes of tomorrow is just broken in gambit. 

This weapon has the ability to wipe out an entire team, in the blink of an eye. 

People said xeno was too op in gambit, it got a nerf. People said sleeper was broken in gambit, and it was nerfed into the ground. 

However a weapon that can wipe a team with a single rocket goes untouched?

One thing that I feel lends to this being broken, is how quickly it can lock on and fire at the targets.

DestinyTheGame,What if Warmind Cells changed to not do damage anymore?,"As we all know for the health of the game, Warmind Cells are inevitably getting a Nerf/Tweak handed out to them down the line this year.

&gt; *""Because we won’t be capping any more of our weapons, we must consider more variables in the game balance of our upcoming seasons and releases, so expect to see tuning when it comes to our biggest outliers in PVP and PVE. Yes, I’m looking at you, Felwinter’s and Warmind Cells.""*

&gt; Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124


With the way Warmind Cells currently work, *(on a point-based per kill system),* we can currently walk into a room knowing the exact moment we are spawning a Cell, &amp; instantly clear out everything in sight apart from Yellow Bars &amp; some Orange Bar enemies.

I absolutely adore running them, but you can't deny that with the ability to set off chain-reacting **nukes**, we've reached the absolute epitome of ""Power Creep"".


Warmind Cells can currently do all of the following:
-

Solar Mods:

- Apply a Solar Damage DoT with Damage so pathetically low it literally kills nothing, BUT will pop every Solar Shield it touches.

- Heal everyone in the radius by a large portion of Health &amp; Shields.

- *(Charges you with light upon defeating multiple enemies.)*

- *(Rapidly defeating enemies with a Cell drops an Orb of Power.)*

- *(Cell does +50% more Damage as Solar, diminishing outwards with range until it does 0%.)*

- Solar Splash Damage generates a Cell.

Void Mods:

- Shooting a Cell fires an outward wave that Stuns/Blinds all enemies. Can be applied multiple times with 1 Cell.

- Pick-up a Cell to take it anywhere you want apart from through loading zones.

- Charges you with light when killing enemies around a Cell, but not with it.

- Provide you a Damage Boost which stacks with a Buff &amp; Debuff. (For example, Power of Rasputin stacks with Bubble/Tether)

- Cell duration lasts longer.

- Provide you a passive 50% Damage Reduction where ever you put the Cell.

Arc Mods:

- Reduce kills needed to make a Cell.

- Physically boop enemies far away like Lucio with a shockwave.

- Chain lightning if you ""collect"" the Cell. Great at popping shields, but not killing things in huge areas.

- Provide a strong regenerative Overshield.

- Grant Melee energy.

- Charge you with light if you collect it.


Warmind Cells can already provide a TON of utility if modded properly.
-


If we removed the damage they did entirely, we'd only need the 3 Solar Mods I left in parenthesis, as nothing else requires you kill an enemy.

- Incinerating Light can be changed to ""Charge you with Light"" when you shoot the Cell, as opposed to killing enemies.

- Light of the Fire can be changed to just drop the Orb of Power when the Cell is destroyed.

- Rage of the Warmind can be changed to... well anything. I'm fond of an effect such as ""Shooting a Warmind Cell staggers Enemies &amp; *(maybe)* champions"", or something like ""shooting a Cell provides an average Damage Boost to any allies near it"".

Because they'd no longer nuke planets, I'd also change/remove Global Reach.
-

- Turn Global Reach into a mod called ""Cell Activation"" which allows any Legendary Weapon to create **AND** Damage Warmind Cells. 

(Shooting a Cell without this would simply hit ""Immune"". Collecting would be unchanged as you need a mod to do that already, but you couldn't generate them yourself without it equipped).

- Make the ""Global Reach range"", default range.

- Increase the cost to 3.

This promotes weapon diversity, stops the complaints of people shooting them with no mods, &amp; gives Warmind Cells the same ""Green Mod / Taking Charge"" required treatment that CWL sets have. 

If allowing any Legendary Weapon is too strong, they can increase the number of kills required to make one, &amp; even buff ""Blessing of Rasputin"" to make it a more attractive choice.



TLDR of the post &amp; my reasoning,
-

TLDR of the Post,

- Keeping in mind the huge amount of Utility &amp; the 4 Mod changes I suggested, would you still use Warmind Cells if they did 0 Damage by default but you could generate them with any Legendary Weapon?

My Reasoning for the suggestion, 

- Removing the damage entirely would let Ad-Clear Weapons, Supers, &amp; etc shine again.

- No longer locked to a small sub-section of Weapons for an entire build.

- Content won't have to be balanced around players being able to kill/damage the entire map from one spot. *(Aka we could actually get a horde-mode-like activity that won't be trivialized by 1 person in the team).*

- Promotes more team/tactical &amp; creative use of their Utility-based Mods like Cellular Suppression, etc.

DestinyTheGame,Active player count for the coming Guardian games event,"TL;DR for Guardian games, base the active player count off of the number of players turning in medals, as that would instantly be an accurate count of the number of players participating. 

Guardian games is coming up and the hot toxic mess that was last year's event is still fresh in memory. Looking back participation was really the biggest problem with the event, especially for hunters. Hunters were given a handicap based on the numbers bungie had for the active player count, but it became clear when they put out the numbers toward the end that a lot of hunters just didn't participate at all during the event. I bring this up because there have been leaks about guardian games and i already see players saying they're not going to participate due to what we have seen being focused on pve. So i propose basing the active player count off of the actual number of players participating. Until a player turns in a medal, they aren't counted, and once they do, they are. I admit I don't know how much effort it would take to do this and it might not be feasible, but I think it should be considered.",1615698222,2021-03-14 00:03:42

DestinyTheGame,Some questions from someone who hasn’t played Destiny since 2017.,"Hey everyone. Recently picked up Destiny again after quite a while away. I played D1 religiously but gave up on D2 early on because I personally didn’t like where it was at back then. The game has changed tremendously and I’m figuring out many things on my own, but I’m having trouble figuring out some things even with google at my fingertips. Feel free to give any advice you feel necessary to a new(ish) player on top of the questions listed below. So here goes...

Main: Titan ~1270 light (have other two classes as well)

What’s the current meta for guns/perks in PvE? How about PvP?

Is there anything I should focus on doing (other than raids) to get certain weapons such as the Falling Guillotine, etc.? What guns/events should I be trying to “farm?”

I had left over silver and bought the Celestial Titan ornament package from Tess. How do these work? Are they reusable, or once they’re on a piece of armor I can never use it again? Don’t want to put it on future obsolete gear and waste money.

Is focusing engrams really necessary or is it for if I’m searching for a specific piece of armor/gun? That whole aspect confuses me a little lol.

Any sweet legendary scout rifles out there?

I’ll end this by saying the Dead Man’s Tale quest and the Prophecy Dungeon were some of the most fun levels in Destiny ever IMO!!

DestinyTheGame,"Avoiding the SBMM debate, Crucible matchmaking is garbage.","THIS IS NOT A POST ABOUT SBMM. While I think SBMM is the better method for matchmaking in video games in general, I understand that it's not coming back to Destiny 2, and I've made my peace with that. But the current system is bullshit.

I just got a cool Bottom Dollar drop from Gambit and decided to jump into a game of Control solo to see how the gun performs. I proceeded to immediately get stomped into oblivion by a 6-stack. I looked at the others on my team and saw no common clan tags, so from my observation, the game basically just put me on a team with 5 other randoms and said ""get fucked"". I turned the game off out of pure frustration.

I don't see how anyone can think this is a good way to fill lobbies, regardless of skill level. Solo queue for Iron Banner was a hugely positive addition to the game, but why is it limited to a game mode we get to play only 1 week per month?

I wish PvP game developers did a better job acknowledging the solo queuers in their games with solo queue options. I frankly don't give a fuck about getting into a game sooner if it means getting mercy'd or having to quit and start searching for a new lobby because I'm getting beat so hard I can't even respawn without dying immediately. I'm not here to speed up a 6-stack's desire for another easy win, I'm here to enjoy myself too.

There are so many problems I have with PvP in Destiny 2, but this one really stuck out to me today because it was such a shitty experience getting a really cool piece of loot only to have any chance to USE it completely negated by an awful PvP match.

But no. Let's just woop dee doo da go to the next area, clear the enemies there to get more motes and completely ignore the fact there is AN INVADER on the field with eyes of tomorrow.

And obviously when the other team calls a primeval, watch the boss' bar go down in 10 seconds.

I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN IN GAMBIT. WOW.

Just take out gambit, man. You wanna free up space? There. Take it out.",1615694918,2021-03-13 23:08:38
DestinyTheGame,Are Citan's Ramparts are still bugged?,"Back when they first came out, it was noted that every once in a while they seem to block or throw off your shots too when you shoot through them. [Video Example and Explaination](https://youtu.be/h9uJkqsnuM0?t=285) 

They also had multiple other bugs, like Devil's Ruin not being able to pass through them at all, and scorch cannons [getting their trajectory distorted in a bizzare way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8yfk64kaX8).

Searching for this I found just one comment saying ""it's fixed now"" with no links or evidence or anything pointing to it being fixed, and just doing some recent testing myself I found the Devil's Ruin bug at the very least still does exist. The blocked shots are the main one i'm worried about and seemed more rare and subtle in some cases and i'm not sure i'd be able to test it in a satisfactory way myself. Is there anything from Bungie (patch notes, comments, etc) talking about this or mentioning a fix for it?",1615694776,2021-03-13 23:06:16

DestinyTheGame,Does Amanda Holliday know who Crow is?,"Recently I have seen more and more friendly interactions between Crow and Amanda, but on one of the recent battlegrounds I did, they started talking about the assassination attempt on Zavala. Holliday mentioned that Zavala was like family and so were people like Ikora and, well, Cayde. Then they talk about how Holliday thinks Cayde's killer got what he deserved etc etc. So I am not sure if Amanda knows the truth but is hiding it from Crow so he does not have a mental breakdown, or does she actually not know who Crow is? Does she know he is the reincarnated body of Uldren but with new light?",1615694395,2021-03-13 22:59:55
DestinyTheGame,Issue with raid players,"My issue is with the raids, specifically the players. The issues stems from the fact that I am mute due to the fact that I have lost my vocal cords in an accident. Because of this I have never been able to play raids in D1 or D2. Recently I have tried to play raids as I have exhausted all other activities in destiny. Whenever I join a raid team and am questioned about why I have no mic and am not speaking I have to inform them that I am mute which almost always leads to me being kicked from the raid, which is the main contributor to why I have never done a raid in Destiny. 

I am asking for ideas as to how I can get around this issue and be able to finally do a raid.

DestinyTheGame,I believe the mod system needs another rework,"We are getting more and more mods, but not more space or flexibility on slots we could install them.

DestinyTheGame,Skyburners Oath catalyst update,"Make it have intrinsic anti barrier. It does make sense to do that. Base form pierces cabal shields, and the catalyst does almost nothing for it. Both modes of fire are projectiles, so extra range does next to nothing.

Yes, there’s stuff like aim assist and all that changing based on range, but it still doesn’t do much. Hence, a change to anti barrier being intrinsic.

Skyburners Oath is already an exotic that doesn’t have much going for it, bar warming cell potential, so why not give it some love Bungie?",1615694112,2021-03-13 22:55:12

Bungie please just let us go somewhere has master rahool or something let us change our characters genders, Race, and facial appearance I think we would all like that.",1615693460,2021-03-13 22:44:20
DestinyTheGame,"Now that sunsetting's getting axed, can we reissue...everything?","Armor isn't such a big deal now that we're getting transmog, but the old sets that aren't available anymore should be obtainable in some other manner for the sake of adding them to collections for use in said transmog.

Weapons are what this post is mainly about, though, as many great weapons were left behind due to sunsetting,  and that's cut exorcised most of the stuff in collections. I think everything should be reissued, that means all the loot that's currently in the game (world drops, the old gambit weapons, etc), all the stuff from content that's been retired (Black Armory, Red War, Menagerie, etc.), and even old pinnacle weapons like Mountaintop (because it was a unique weapon that was astoundingly fun to use in PvE, and there is a distinct lack of decent Special weapons in the Kinetic slot that aren't Exotics).

Ada-1 is returning as a vendor for transmog, so maybe we could obtain BA stuff from her somehow, Drifter never left, so all the old Gambit and Joker's Wild weapons could easily be given to him. We'll probably be revisiting the Leviathan at some point during Caiatl's arc to confront Calus, so whatever activity's there we could add the old Raid and Menagerie weapons to. 

In short, there have been *tons* of weapons in Destiny's history, some of them are fun to use, some of them are really effective, some of them look cool, and some are all three. Having nearly all of them rendered unusable like that is tragic, and I think every last one of them is due for a comeback in some form, from some loot source.",1615692977,2021-03-13 22:36:17
DestinyTheGame,"If you don’t have divinity, PLEASE get it ASAP !!! 12 man fireteams make garden laughably easy.","This is gonna be the last time it’s this easy to do. You just need to get the quest steps done beforehand (beat up some vex &amp; visit some lost sectors, there’s guides on YouTube).

DestinyTheGame,1-2 punch not proc-ing,"Hello, I run a titan build utilizing heart of inmost light, code of the juggernaut (striker) and prophet of doom with one-two punch. I've been using this build since I set it up two days ago, but I'm just now realizing it.

When I shotgun again I still have charged with light x1, frontal assault, and knockout. But 1-2 punch doesn't show up.

DestinyTheGame,Two Tailed fox Catalyst ideas,"these are gonna be random different ideas i had

general ideas

* two tailed's void rocket should disrupt, since it is doing half the heavy lifting already
   * [Two tailed fox and overload champion weirdness](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/m4ho3c/two_tailed_fox_an_d_its_weird_overload_interaction/)
* the tracking effects should be updated to be similar to eyes of tomorrow since you can track more then 1 target currently with 2TF

**Idea 1**

* enhanced rockets
   * increased blast radius
      * \+20
   * suppression rocket is an implosion
      * acts like duck field, if your within the AoE youll get ripped into the center
   * solar rocket does more impact damage
   * improved tracking

**Idea 2**

primed and detonated

* holding reload primes the weapons warheads with super energy
   * this Greatly increased blast radius
   * greatly reduces all rocket damage
   * greatly increases effects duration
   * costs 20% of max super energy
* striking an enemy with an normal rocket detonates those struck causing MASSIVE damage and chaining high blast radius explosions to all those affected

**Idea 3 (dont quite like it but need to get it outs my head)**

Mating Pair

* now fires 4 rockets
   * Solar Void Arc and Stasis
   * total damage remains the same reducing individual rocket damage
   * stasis freezes and arc flash bangs
   * fireing patteren is Arc, Void, Stasis, Solar.
      * arc void and stasis combined do 50% of total damage with the final solar rocket doing the remaining 50%
   * yes this would mean you could target 4 different targets

Idea 4

simple prime an detonation

* direct impact with the void then solar releases an large extremely high damage blast

Idea 5

useability buff

* grants vorpal weapon
* grants the following stat buffs
   * \+35 velocity
   * \+25 reload
   * \+20 blast radius

DestinyTheGame,Destiny 2 The game with a monetization problem,"So Ive been playing destiny ever since the 2014 beta and later on to destiny 2 during its release until before the launch of shadowkeep. For me I can handle the game going free to play, I can handle having to pay for the expansions but I draw the line at the dang season pass and the vaulting of content.

 1st off the season pass, it literally undercuts the point of the exansions and with the upcoming vog raid to comeback to Destiny 2 in season 14 (probably accesible only through the season pass) whats the point of the bigger expansions. I know Bungie is probably thirsty for cash due to them making destiny 2 free to play but its hard to get into the game if all im seeing is a battlepass to access the content throughout the year ontop of the expansion im not kidding the yearly expansion just feels like a overpriced season in Destiny 2. A way I can see them fixing this is to make the combination of the  annual pass and the expansion together permenant instead of a preorder exclusive purchase and reduce the price to just the expansion price. (On that note am I only one who see's spending $80 for a free to play game who whose gonna remove said content later on for when they feel the game size is too big a bit ridiculous)

 Now onto the content vaulting. I can understand bungie trying reducing the size of the game but literally taking out content and ""potentially"" rotating them in and out of the game without compensating older players  (beta testers at this point for those of us who  played and paid destiny 2 in year 1 up till forsaken)  is just ridiculous I feel personally angry that they dident bother to think of older players like me and it kind of suprise's me that no legal action has been taken against bungie for literally devaluing a product that people thought  wouldent have its content removed. If they were to give players who were playing destiny 2 ever since launch a lifetime pass to all future seasons then yeah i would feel like I got recompensated for the the money that is now in the void of bungie's hard drive's but as it stands now im stuck with less of a game than what i bought into.",1615690198,2021-03-13 21:49:58

DestinyTheGame,Hunter - Presage Regular Solo loadout help,"I’m trying to complete the Presage Solo.  I got to the boss today and got it’s damn health down to like 1/8th, it teleported right on me at one is the spots you can drop down to, and I was dead.
I don’t have the Salvo grenade launcher yet and I don’t have Anarchy.  I’ve got to look for a new clan that’s friendly and wants to do raids and show people.  I’m at 1309 power which includes the 10 boost.  I don’t have a Code Duello with the lasting impression and I keep trying to get one.  

I’ve tried with Witherhoard and that seems good for the mission but not great for the boss. I’ve done the pipe thing just tossing the witherhoard nades down.  I’ve tried the Jotunn and it’s good. The best boss damage seems to be Xenophage for the weapons I have.  I don’t have most of the Raid weapons, no Izinagis either. 

I’ve been using top tree NS with some charged with light mods like protective light.  The Code Duello launcher I have is ok, but it’s not great at accuracy and I’ve tested it outside the mission.  

I’ve read some people use truth but then you don’t get the damage burn.  I’ve been using the 6th Coyote for the extra dodge.  I’ve tried stasis and it’s good for the ads and freezing the boss, but that invis has saved me a bunch of times.

DestinyTheGame,Progression Question. I'm a noob who &lt;3's Grinding,"So I am a returning D2 player and left a few years ago and I just recently came back, and unfortunately could not recover my characters as a I made them on BattleNet and did not transfer them in time.

This is fine, I am not worried about that, I was just curious, as I started brand new with Beyond Light, and I am currently 1265 Light/Power Level and was wondering what the best thing to do as a long term goal.  I am assuming I just keep doing the Powerful gear drops each week until I get up to 1300 and then start doing the pinnacles, and I would like to Raid eventually but if I cant raid until 1300 that's probably gonna a while, so I just wanted your opinion on what's the best thing to do for my level.  I feel so confused when I look at all the mod components and armor upgrades and everything, so a little guidance would be neat.

Thanks.",1615688691,2021-03-13 21:24:51

I have to wipe a team out in Gambit in one invasion, but annoyingly I can’t get over 3.

I’d appreciate any guidance people can give me as I’ve been stuck on this for a while.

DestinyTheGame,"The Blue 120 Hand Cannon called ""Azimuth DSU"" actually feels pretty solid and has Kill Clip for the 2 taps.","Took this out of collections to take into PvP for the lolz and it actually felt very good, especially the 2 taps lol. Give it a go if you can handle 120s. The reload is absurdly bad so if you can find ways around it via dodge, transversive steps/ophidian aspect and for the titan class, Aeon Swift with Sect of Force works for reload  if you combine it with a loader mod.  I recommend the 2nd option in the 1st column for more stability. Goes well with shaders too.",1615688422,2021-03-13 21:20:22

DestinyTheGame,"Gambit desperately needs some work in its current state, and a tutorial mission","I have some suggestions, TL;DR below

#Gambit could really use a tutorial mission/quest

I've seen blueberries banking 3 and 4 motes. Although it doesn't happen often it hurts to see

- the tutorial mission could award a gambit legendary weapon or armor (so even vets have a reason to do it). It should put a player on the EDZ (most simple) map, or have a completely new arena that the drifter is using/ testing out for gambit. It should explain the following.

- use and explain blockers, what they do and what each tier does

- explains how and when you can invade

- explains what happens when you get invaded

- Explains killing envoys

- explains generalities such as the gray on the bars, HVTs, weapon choices (for killing ads, invading and killing blockers) heavy ammo etc.

#How gambit can change:

Saw another person post/ about heavy ammo and I loved the idea (sorry I don't know your username)

- make heavy ammo is less dependent on enemies and ONLY spawn (as a crate that all can take) at 50 and 100 motes banked. 

    1. this will be great because I have some matches where I never get heavy yet I get invaded by guys with seemingly full ammo

    2.  makes the first invasion MUCH less dependent on heavy ammo. Typically the first invasions swings the a match very heavily on one side 

#add a gambit freelance mode. 

I think this will be a great idea because my friends dislike gambit. I enjoy playing it, cranking out bounties, and making ol' Drifter proud. It isn't very fun getting back to back 4 stacks

#Primevals need something. 

We have gotten stronger since forsaken but the primevals have not and can, at times, be melted in literal seconds. I am not sure what exactly they need; however, I have some ideas.

- immunity phase like in Gambit prime 

- larger health pool (downside of this is blueberries or people trying to get bounties done may not have ""optimal"" DPS weapons.

Please if you have any other feasible ideas put them in the comments.

Also, if you agree that gambit could use some changes make posts about it, or upvote this one so that Bungie is more aware that this ought to be bumped a little higher on the priority list  :)


TLDR:

Add a tutorial mission/ quest with a gambit legendary as a reward. 

Make heavy ammo less dependent on RNG and have ammo crates spawn and 50 and 100 mote.

Add gambit freelance (please, please)

Primeval need either: immunity phases or a larger health pool.",1615687504,2021-03-13 21:05:04
DestinyTheGame,A head canon story,"I'd recommend reading this in the character's voices in your heads. Asteriks so mods don't auto-remove based on words contained.

*Banshee's working on his gun at the Gunsmith's workstation like he always is when Saint-14 angrily walks up to him*

Saint: You sell Hakke, no?

Banshee: ... yes?

Saint: Explain! \[slams Tr\*als report down on Banshee's workbench\]

\[Banshee reads.\]

Saint: Osiris and I had to cancel our beloved tradition again this week over this.

Banshee (done reading): ...I don't think I have anything to do with this.

Saint: You gave them their identification, yes?

Banshee: I can't really remember.

Saint: This... is not good enough. Remember harder!

Banshee: I don't... wait. I used to give those things out left and right to my clients, nobody ever used them up until now.

Saint: Aha! You will pay for this, forgetful one.

Banshee: What could you possibly want that I have?

Saint: I do not know. But I will think.

\[Saint leaves. Later that day, he returns with Osiris.\]

Banshee: Hey, you two.

Saint: I have figured out what you are to do!

Banshee: ...huh? Oh, about the Tr\*als problem you're blaming me for?

Saint: Yes!

Osiris: Saladin's been going off the rails lately. Been a nightmare to work comms with on the Battlegrounds. Said something very unpleasant about Sagira today. So I would like for you to sell one of your Rasputin mods today.

Banshee: Rasputin mods... hmmmm... \[thinks for a second\]. Oh, right. You mean W\*rmind Cells. But why?

Osiris: The W\*rmind Rasputin took everything from him a long time ago, and it would pain him to see a sudden uptake in Guardians using the W\*rmind's abilities in combat. While I'm not normally the type for petty revenge, suffice it to say that he dealt a low blow.

Saint: Make him feel the way he made Osiris feel, yes?

Banshee: Alright. I actually forgot I had those mods stocked, thanks for reminding me. But I don't want Saladin coming after me next time he's in the Tower.

Saint: That's alright. He will not. Besides, even if he does, you will not remember why he is there.

Banshee: That's fair.",1615687093,2021-03-13 20:58:13
